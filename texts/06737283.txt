Abstract—Focused ultrasound (FUS) in the presence of microbubbles can bring about transcranial and local opening of the
blood–brain barrier (BBB) for potential noninvasive delivery of
drugs to the brain. A phased-array ultrasound system is essential
for FUS-BBB opening to enable electronic steering and correction of the focal beam which is distorted by cranial bone. Here,
we demonstrate our prototype design of a 256-channel ultrasound
phased-array system for large-region transcranial BBB opening
in the brains of large animals. One of the unique features of this
system is the capability of generating concurrent dual-frequency
ultrasound signals from the driving system for potential enhancement of BBB opening. A wide range of signal frequencies can be
generated (frequency = 0.2–1.2 MHz) with controllable driving
burst patterns. Precise output power can be controlled for individual channels via 8-bit duty-cycle control of transistor–transistor
logic signals and the 8-bit microcontroller-controlled buck converter power supply output voltage. The prototype system was
found to be in compliance with the electromagnetic compatibility
standard. Moreover, large animal experiments confirmed the phase
switching effectiveness of this system, and induction of either a precise spot or large region of BBB opening through fast focal-beam
switching. We also demonstrated the capability of dual-frequency
exposure to potentially enhance the BBB-opening effect. This study
contributes to the design of ultrasound phased arrays for future
clinical applications, and provides a new direction toward optimizing FUS brain drug delivery.

I. INTRODUCTION
T has been confirmed that focused ultrasound (FUS) burst
tone exposure in the presence of microbubbles induces local
and reversible blood–brain barrier (BBB) opening [1]–[4].
This transcranial procedure opens a new frontier to explore the
noninvasive delivery of over 95% of therapeutic molecules that
were originally incapable of penetrating across the BBB into
the brain. A number of preclinical studies have already demonstrated the feasibility of FUS-BBB opening for enhancing
chemotherapeutic agent delivery [5]–[7], gene delivery [8], [9],
monoclonal antibody delivery [10], or even the delivery of stem
cells [11], suggesting the exciting prospect of developing this
technique to perform noninvasive CNS therapy in a clinical
setting.
Multiple-element ultrasound phased array is an attractive
approach for therapeutic FUS applications. Unlike a singleelement transducer with fixed focus at the geometric center,
an ultrasound phased array can steer the focus of the ultrasonic energy to an arbitrary position by driving each element
with a signal of the appropriate phase. Dynamic focal beam
scanning can thus be achieved by electronically altering the
relative phases of the elements’ signals. The relative phase of
each element is independently controlled, and interference of the
generated radio-frequency (RF) driving signals result in generation of focal beam energy spatially surrounding the geometrical center. Moreover, since the phase switch is controlled by
the electrical signal control of the driving system, high speed
switching of the ultrasound energy, and therefore high-speed focal scanning, becomes possible. Such ultrasound phased-array
systems are increasingly being used for clinical applications.
Buchanan et al. proposed a 64-channel, 500-kHz, continuous
wave (CW) mode phased-array system for transrectal thermal
ablation [12]. Daum and Hynynen [13] designed a 256-element
phased-array system for use in CW mode with a 1.1-MHz spherically curved phased array for abdominal thermal ablation. For
brain application, Clement et al. first presented the concept
of hemispherical ultrasound phased-array design [14]. Pernot
et al. [15] also showed that a multiple element hemispherical

array operating at a frequency of 1 MHz can successfully generate targeted thermal lesions through an intact animal skull
after applying focus-restoring technology. In addition, Clement
et al. and Hynynen et al. developed CW 500-element driving
systems for use with hemispherical phased arrays operating at
700–800 kHz for brain–tissue thermal ablation [16], [17].
Adaptation of the current thermal-ablation-based ultrasound
phased-array system for the application of FUS BBB opening
requires a different design of the selection of driving frequency.
The center frequency for clinical thermal ablation should be
at least 0.8 MHz to provide suitable tissue-heat absorption for
the required elevation in temperature [18]–[20]. On the other
hand, the application of FUS in BBB opening requires an operating frequency which results in less heat absorption by bone
and fewer cranial ultrasound aberrations/distortions. Moreover,
unlike the CW mode ultrasound energy exposure of thermal ablation, the ultrasound energy required for BBB opening needs to
be the repetitive burst tone type exposure so that microbubbles
can be back-filled in the next circulation cycle [4], [21]. Temporal disruption of the BBB relies on this microbubble-ultrasound
interaction which induces tight-junction and endothelial cell
deformation [22]. We previously developed a low-frequency
hemispherical ultrasound phased-array system (260 kHz,
32-channel) for BBB opening, and demonstrated its successfully application [23]. Recently, Song et al. also investigated
the use of a commercial 1011-element, 230 kHz hemispherical
ultrasound phased array for the purpose of transcranial ultrasound beam steering [24]. A number of other recent studies
have also demonstrated induction of a relatively large area of
BBB opening by either electronic or mechanical steering with
multiple sonication cycles at different adjacent target positions
(for example 3 × 3 matrix sonication) [25], [26], thus confirming the importance of ultrasound phased-array technology for
CNS drug delivery.
Up to date, FUS-induced BBB opening has been limited to
single-frequency exposure, regardless of whether a phased array or single element transducer was used. However, dual frequency ultrasound has been successfully applied in other applications and is well known to enhance acoustic cavitation as
measured by enhanced subharmonic/ultraharmonic emissions
(an indication of stable cavitation), enhanced wideband emissions/enhanced hydrogen peroxide in the medium (an indication
of inertial cavitation), or bubble enrichment (a macroscopic bubble/cavitation effect) [27]–[29]. Previous studies have demonstrated the enhancement of stable cavitation by dual-frequency
exposure, both with and without microbubbles [29], [30]. The
enhanced cavitation effect due to dual-frequency ultrasound exposure has also been shown to enhance the anticancer effect
(1 MHz/150 kHz) [31], skin permeability (frequency combination ranging from 20 to 3 MHz) [32], and drug delivery
(70/500 kHz) [33]. We also previously demonstrated the use
of single-element ultrasound to achieve dual-frequency excitation to enhance acoustic cavitation [28]. For the application of
brain drug delivery, acoustic cavitation is already known to be
highly correlated with the degree of FUS-induced BBB opening [34]. Therefore, the use of dual-frequency exposure with
a phased-array system design could potentially allow further

manipulation of the BBB-opening process to increase brain drug
delivery.
The aim of this study was to demonstrate our prototype design of a novel 256-channel ultrasound phased-array driving
system capable of both dual-frequency excitation and induction
of large-scale transcranial BBB opening via electronic steering.
A key feature of the system design is its capability of simultaneously generating multiple frequency outputs. A 256-channel
low-frequency ultrasound driving system was designed to provide a suitable acoustic output for BBB opening. The phased
array was spherically curved to allow delivery of concentrated
ultrasonic energy into the brain. The performance of the FUS
phased array was evaluated. Theoretical predictions were used
to optimize the design of the phased array and compare its
performance with the experimental data. Large animal experiments and histological examinations were conducted to assess
the ability of the phased-array system to disrupt the BBB.
II. METHODS
A. Cascade-Microcontroller/Field-Programmable-Gate-Array
(MCU/FPGA)-Based 256-Channel Dual-Frequency
Control Kernel Design
The design overview and photographs of the 256-channel
ultrasound phased-array driving system are shown in Figs. 1
and 2. The system consists of three major circuit modules: the
control kernel, the multiple channel RF driver, and the multiple
channel high-speed power sensor feedback.
For the control kernel, we modified our previous design [23]
by using an MCU/FPGA-based embedded system structure
which generated 256-channel phasing transistor–transistor logic
(TTL) signal outputs (see Fig. 1). MCUs were used to communicate with the down-stage FPGAs for phasing and control of
output parameters. Commercially available 8-bit units (PIC 18 F
452, Microchip, Chandler, Arizona, USA) were used as MCUs.
Two master MCUs and four slave MCUs were embedded in the
control kernel. The purpose of the first master MCU (denoted
MCU-M1) was: 1) to serve as the communication unit with the
PC through the universal synchronous–asynchronous receiver
transmitter (USART) EIA-232 protocol operated in “transmit”
mode; and 2) to provide voltage control for power output

Fig. 2. Appearance of (a) system cabinet and (b) circuit composition of the
256-channel ultrasound phased-array driving system. The system consists of
a single control kernel board, one differential TTL output board, 32 dc-to-ac
inverter boards, and 32 matching and power sensing boards. In addition to the
designed circuit board, four sets of MCU-controlled buck dc-to-dc converters
in conjunction with four power supplies were installed in the system cabinet.

regulation through a voltage-controlled buck converter via
pulsewidth modulation (PWM) control.
The purpose of the second master MCU (denoted MCU-M2)
was to provide power feedback from the power sensing module
from each driving channel connected to a multiplexor network.
This network could sequentially sense the forward and reflected
power through the 8-channel A/D converter on the MCU (via
the directional coupler). Each MCU A/D input channel was connected to a two-stage 8-to-1 multiplexer (MUX HEF 4067 B,
NXP Semiconductor) that together provided 256 forward and
another 256 reflected power sensing channels, i.e., a total of 512
channel feedback signals for each MCU A/D input pin. The PC
and MCU-M2 communicated in the USART EIA-485 “receive”
mode to sequentially transmit the 256-channel forward and
256-channel reflected power data back to the PC for real-time
display of individual high-speed power information.
Four PIC1 8 F 452 MCUs were used as slave-MCUs (denoted
MCU-1 to MCU-4), each serving as a 64-channel TTL phasing output to the RF driving modules. The four slave-MCUs
received multiple groups of phasing signals from MCU-M1
(through the interintegrated communication protocol), and communicated with the downstream FPGA integrated circuits (ICs)
(CY 22395 FC, Altera, USA) to assign the phase difference
among the channels from the 8-bit parallel I/O ports. Details
of the implementation of phasing signal generation have been
previously described [23].
In order to rapidly switch different phasing signals on each
transducer element for fast focal beam scanning, multiple phasing groups were recorded in the FPGA memory slots and a
synchronizing trigger signal from MCU-M1 controlled simultaneous switching of the phasing information in the four FPGAs.
Burst-tone mode excitation was achieved by a simple latch circuit in the FPGA which generated RF output with a controllable
burst length signal ranging from 0.1 to 999.9 ms at a resolution
of 0.1 ms. Besides burst length, the pulse-repetition frequency

(PRF), total burst number, and total exposure time could also be
controlled from the PC.
The system was designed to have a tunable operation frequency and to be capable of simultaneously generating output
from multiple operating frequencies. In this study, we implemented dual frequency output. The system included a phaselocked loop (PLL)/voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) IC (CY
22395 FC, Cypress Semiconductor, Inc.) with multiple VCOs
generating clock output. Since the maximum clock frequency
generation of PLL/VCO IC was 200 MHz, the programmed
FPGA produced TTL phasing signals ranging from 200 kHz
to 1.2 MHz, resulting in 6-bit phase resolution (i.e., phase resolution of 5.625◦ per channel). The ability to select either the
FVCO,1 or FVCO,2 clock in an individual channel allowed the
256-channel control kernel to simultaneously generate two distinct operating frequency TTL signals, thereby functioning as a
256-channel dual-frequency ultrasound phased-array system.
B. Wideband RF Driving/High-Speed Power Sensing Design
The driving circuit in each channel comprised three parts: An
MCU-controlled dc-to-dc buck converter, an RF amplifier, and
high-speed power sensing. A MCU-controlled dc power supply
with a maximum total electrical power output of 1000 W was
designed in-house. The output dc voltage was supplied from
an in-house designed MCU-controlled dc-to-dc buck converter
(input voltage = 50 V, output voltage = 5–25 V), and was controllable by PWM signals from the MCU. To ensure the stability
of the output power, the MCU received feedback from the output
dc voltage. Output voltage was adjustable at the control panel.
The maximum power output was designed to be 20 W for each
channel.
The output power of the system could be regulated by the
PWM-controlled buck dc supply, as well as the control kernel,
which provided the flexibility to generate TTL output with various duty cycles (ranging from 30% to 50%, 8-bit resolution;
50% duty cycle represents symmetrical TTL signal output). The
PWM-controlled buck dc voltage served as the primary output
power designation, and the duty cycle control for individual TTL
output signals served as a secondary power regulation route, especially for calibration of the power during operation.
The RF amplifier was designed so that the 256-channel TTL
phasing signal (3.3 V) could be fed into differential amplifier
modules to gain current driving capability (5 V). A half-bridge
dc-to-ac inverter constructed by high-voltage MOSFETs was
used to generate a high-voltage square wave, and high-voltage
diodes were used to deal with high-voltage switching transients.
A transformer-type LC oscillating module was connected to allow a high-voltage inverter to transform the high-voltage square
wave into a high-voltage sinusoidal wave that matched the ultrasound phased-array element (typically with impedance of
several kilohm).
Finally, we designed a high-speed power sensing module
based on directional coupler technology [11], [21]. We used
eight directional couplers, each providing power sensing for
256 channel outputs including forward and reflected power.
Power-dependent forward and reflected voltage sensing from

the coupler was fed sequentially into the MCU from two-stage
64-to-1 multiplexers via A/D conversion. The data transmission
rate of 9600 bit/s allowed the system to receive 256-channel
forward/reflected power information at up to 2 frames/s. A rate
of 1 frame/s was found to be sufficient for the purpose of realtime power monitoring in this study. Voltage standing-wave
ratio (VSWR) was employed to serve as a measure of electrical power transmission efficiency (described in detail in our
previous system design [23]).

output (for all channels). To steer the ultrasonic energy at the
geometric center, all channels of the driving system were driven
in the same phase. Focus steering at a position off the geometric
center was based on simple echo traveling and beamforming
criteria described previously [13]. For all measurements, the
measured distance between the inner skull (either swine or human) and the PVDF hydrophone was fixed at 15 mm for all
locations.
In addition to the pressure field measurement, the acoustic
pressure distribution from the spherically curved phased array was also predicted theoretically in the free-field case, using the Rayleigh–Sommerfeld integral [22], [35] through the
finite-difference-based numerical implementation of MATLAB
(Mathworks, Natick, MA). To evaluate the influence of the skull
during transcranial delivery of FUS energy into the brain, we
investigated the pressure loss caused by the inserted skulls. The
calibrated ultrasonic pressure and focal beam dimensions were
measured both with and without four harvested swine skulls
and in three human cadavers. In transcranial focal-beam pressure measurements, skulls were immersed in a degassed water
tank, with the transducer fixed by the stage and PC-programmed
orientation-fixed, 2-D translations were performed (i.e., without
tilting transducer nor skull). The transmission efficiency was defined as the ratio of the measured pressure with skull insertion to
free-field pressure (in %; randomly selected 8 and 50 positions
for each swine and human skull, respectively).

C. 256-Channel Spherically-Curved Phased Array
A spherically-curved ultrasound phased array was used for
the demonstration, measurement, and in vivo large animal experiments of the 256-channel driving system (F-number = 1;
Imasonic, Inc., France). The phased array was of piezocomposite type with a frequency of 400–800 kHz, diameter of
120 mm, and a curvature radius of 120 mm, diced into 5.5
× 5.5 mm elements [see Fig. 3(a)]. In impedance matching, the
transformer-type impedance transformation configuration was
employed to provide wideband (400–800 kHz) power transmission [see Fig. 3(b)]. The transducer dimensions were originally
designed to fit a human head and could be used for swine applications (distance between parietal to temporal bone in swine is
less than 80 mm).
D. Acoustic Pressure Measurement, Prediction, and Beam
Steering Calibration
The free-field pressure field and pressure decay after transmitting FUS through three human cranial bones were measured as previously described [22]. A 3-D positioning table with a polyvinylidene-difluoride (PVDF) type hydrophone
(Onda, Sunnyvale, California, USA; calibration range: 50 kHz
to 20 MHz) was used to measure the pressure distribution induced by the spherically curved ultrasound phased arrays. The
spatial resolution was 0.5 mm in radial directions (denoted as the
X- and Y -axes) and 1 mm in the axial direction (denoted as the
Z-axis), with maximum measured distances of 40 and 120 mm,
respectively. The maximum measured acoustic pressure was
2 MPa, which was equivalent to 300 W of electrical power

E. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Testing
The 256-channel ultrasound driving system was also used
to perform electromagnetic (EM) immunity and EM emission testing to evaluate its EMC (Electronics Testing Center,
Taoyuan, Taiwan). EM emission after testing was found to be in
compliance with the class-A, group-1 type, CISPR 11 electromagnetic interference (EMI) standard. The system passed the
tests for radiated disturbance, disturbance power, harmonic current emission, and voltage fluctuations (based on IEC610003-2), as well as flicker (based on IEC61000-3-3). The system also passed EM immunity tests of electrostatic discharge,
radiated RF EM fields, electrical fast transient and bursts,
surges, conducted disturbances (induced by RF fields), voltage
dips/interruptions/variations, power-frequency magnetic field,
and power frequency variation immunity.
F. In Vivo Animal Experiments
The BBB opening effect induced by our 256-channel focused driving system was tested in a total of ten swine (body
weight 5–8 kg). All animal procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chang-Gung
University. Animals were anesthetized with isofluorane. The top
of the cranium was shaved with clippers, and a PE-50 catheter
was inserted into the ear vein for injections. During FUS treatment, ultrasound microbubbles were constantly infused through
the ear vein (SonoVue, Bracco Diagnostics, Inc., Milan, Italy)
at 0.3 mL/kg/min. The spherically curved 256-element ultrasound phased array was employed for animal sonication. A

1354

custom-made stereotactic frame was designed to hold the transducer and provide fixed and 3-D translational/rotational positioning of the transducer. In this study, the image guidance procedure was replaced by self-designed stereotactic positioning
combined with a priori knowledge of swine brain anatomy [26]
to direct the ultrasound beam to its target position. Three different BBB-opening patterns were induced to investigate whether
focal beam scanning could cover the volume of different target regions. In pattern 1, FUS was delivered to a single focal
point driven at a single frequency of 400 kHz (pressures =
0.52/0.78 MPa; burst length = 10 ms, PRF = 1 Hz, total duration = 30 s) or 600 kHz (pressure = 0.52 MPa; burst length
= 10 ms, PRF = 1 Hz, total duration = 30 s) [26]. In pattern
2, we delivered 3 × 3 sonication points via fast scanning with
adjacent focal point spacing of 7 mm at frequency of 600 kHz
(pressure = 0.52 MPa; burst length = 10 ms, PRF = 9 s, total
duration = 30 s). Since the single 600-kHz 0.52-MPa exposure
can induce a 6–8 mm BBB-opened dimension in cross section,
it is expected that the mutual overlap produced with this spacing
induced at least a 20 × 20 mm2 BBB-opened dimension in cross
section, similar to the scheme used in recent large-animal studies
[25], [26]. In pattern 3, FUS was steered to a single focal point,
but with mixed frequencies of 400 and 600 kHz (pressure =
0.52 MPa; burst length = 10 ms, PRF = 1 s, total duration = 30 s;
randomly-selected 128 elements were driven at 400 kHz, and
the others were driven at 600 kHz; elements driven at 600 kHz
were recalibrated to reach the overall 0.52-MPa exposure
level).
G. Spectrophotometric Quantification of Evans Blue Dye and
Histological Examination
The extent of FUS-BBB opening was assessed by measuring
the penetration and deposition of Evans blue dye (EB; Molecular weight of 960 Da and becomes 60–70 kDa when bounds
to serum albumin), which cannot normally penetrate the BBB.
We previously demonstrated that spectrophotometry provides
accurate quantitative information of EB penetration and correlates well with Gd-DTPA leakage as monitored by MRI [36].
After FUS exposure, EB (3% in saline) was intravenously injected (2 mg/kg) and the animals were sacrificed 4 h later by
decapitation. For each FUS exposure pattern, the EB-stained
brain tissues were collected and then homogenized, weighed,
and placed in formamide (1 ml/100 mg) at 60 ◦ C for 24 h. Extracted samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 14000 r/min.
The concentration of dye extracted from each brain was determined spectrophotometrically at 620 nm by comparison with a
standard graph created by recording optical densities from serial dilutions of EB in 0.9% sodium chloride solution. EB tissue
content was quantified using a linear regression standard curve
derived from seven concentrations of the dye. To histologically
evaluate the applied FUS exposure among FUS exposure patterns, 5–20 frozen sections (10 μm thick) covering the exposure
regions were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Under
examination by light microscopy, the occurrence of erythrocyte
extravasations (defined as the identification of grouped erythrocytes) was evaluated. Massive erythrocyte extravasation in brain

parenchyma after FUS-BBB opening procedure was considered
to be a hazardous complication [3], [4], [37].
III. RESULTS
A. Control Kernel Testing
When operating at single-frequency output, the multiple
channel system generated stable phasing TTL signals over a
wide range of designated frequencies [200–800 kHz; Fig. 4(a)–
(c)]. The measured frequency discrepancy of TTL signal was
less than 0.08% (corresponding to phase error < 0.18◦ ). We
also investigated the capability of the system to generate
dual-frequency simultaneous phasing TTL output signals [see
Fig. 4(d)–(f)]. The system could generate a small beating frequency between the two designated frequencies, for example, a beat frequency of 40 kHz between 380 and 420 kHz
[see Fig. 4(d)] [38], [39], and can be applied to both narrowband piezoelectric ceramics or wideband piezocomposite materials. We also demonstrated the simultaneous output of a center frequency and second harmonic frequency [400/800 kHz;
Fig. 4(e)]. To support this type of ultrasound energy exposure,
two piezoelectric ceramics with different center frequencies
should be selected to match the designated output frequencies,
or a large bandwidth transducer can be used to cover the frequency range. This type of excitation could potentially be used
for cavitation-enhanced therapy [30], [34]. Moreover, a typical
transducer features base mode (i.e., baseband frequency) and
third mode (i.e., third harmonic frequency) excitation [34], [40].
Fig. 4(h) shows that the simultaneous center frequency/third harmonic frequency output can be applied to excite the same ceramic transducer in its baseband mode or third harmonic mode.
The measured frequency discrepancy was higher in the dual than
in the single-frequency generation mode, but still within the acceptable range (a maximum of 1.67 ± 1.06 kHz), with measured
output frequency discrepancy < 0.5% (corresponding to a phase
error of 1.5◦ ).

to an ideal VSWR of 1. All measured VSWR values were < 1.22, which was
equivalent to an electrical power transfer efficiency > 99%.

axis and 5 V/Div in vertical axis; spectral scale: 500 kHz/Div in horizontal axis
and 20 dB/Div in vertical axis.

B. RF Driving Module Testing
The electrical output can be regulated either by the MCUcontrolled buck converter voltage level [see Fig. 5(a) and (b)]
or by the duty cycle of the TTL phasing signal from the FPGA
output end [see Fig. 5(c) and (d)]. A wide range of power (0–
5 W per channel with 8-bit resolution) could be produced by
either power control route. The electrical power transmission
efficiency was maintained at higher than 99.5%. The power
could also be regulated to allow dynamic generation of bursttone mode high-voltage output and frequencies which varied
over time in each sonication. The measured maximum rise time
of power regulation was 146 μs/V for an RF output with peakto-peak voltage of 150 V, which was sufficient for stabilizing
the output power of ms-level burst mode RF signal excitation.

excitations when focused at geometrical center. With 400-kHz
or 600-kHz excitation, a single-frequency sinusoidal signal was
observed on the oscilloscope. Only 400 kHz (or 600 kHz) and its
corresponding harmonic components were observed in the frequency domain spectrum [see Fig. 6(a) and (b)]. When 400/600kHz excitation was used, cross-modulated time-domain signals
were observed, and frequency components of 400 × m ± 600
× n kHz could be observed where m and n were integers [see
Fig. 6(c)].
Fig. 7 shows the measured 2-D pressure distributions at 400kHz or 600-kHz single-frequency excitation as well as 400/600kHz dual-frequency excitation when focused at geometrical center (without giving relative phases among elements), steered
along one direction off-center (10 mm), or with 2-D steering
off-center (10 mm along both directions). It was observed that
600-kHz and 400/600-kHz excitation provided a sharper distribution in the –3 dB dimension than in the 400-kHz one (3.1 and
2.9 mm at 600-kHz and 400/600-kHz excitation, respectively,
compared to 3.5 mm at 400-kHz excitation).
Fig. 8 shows the comparison of the simulated and measured
pressure profiles, either along the radial direction [see Fig. 8(a),
(c), and (e)] or radial-axial direction [Fig. 8(b), (d), and (f)]
with the frequency set to 400, 600, or dual 400/600 kHz. Simulated predictions of the distributions and magnitudes of the
pressure correlated well with the actual pressure measurements.
Along the radial-direction steering shift, the measured pressure decayed 22.4%, 23.2%, and 23.4% when steering 10-mm
off-center at 400, 600, and dual 400/600-kHz excitations, respectively. In the focal plane, the side lobe magnitudes were all
−6 dB (i.e., 50%) less than the focal point for all frequency
excitations. Thus, the phased array provided well-concentrated
ultrasonic energy when steering 10-mm off the geometrical center in the radial direction.

Next, we measured the transmission efficiency when FUS energy was transmitted through swine and human skulls. For four
swine skulls (see Fig. 9(a), S1–S4), the pressure transmission
efficiency (compared to free-field measurement) was estimated
to be 75.1 ± 2.9% (S1), 70.4 ± 3.3% (S2), 76.5 ± 2.1% (S3),
and 73.7 ± 4.0% (S4) at 400 kHz [see Fig. 9(e)]. In addition,
the pressure transmission efficiency measured from three human
skulls (see Fig. 9(b)–(d), H1–H3) was 34.7 ± 8.3% (H1), 31.5
± 7.9% (H2), and 32.4 ± 5.3% (H3) at 400 kHz [see Fig. 9(e)].
The pressure transmission efficiency was also found to be dependent on operating frequency, and decreased from 79 ± 10%

D. In Vivo Experiments
The setup of the large-animal experiments is shown in
Fig. 10(a). The animal was placed in a prone position beneath
the transducer. The transducer was covered by a polyethylene
bag filled with degassed water to serve as an acoustic coupling, and was tightly attached to the shaved animal scalp. The
transducer was fixed on the custom-made stereotactic frame so
that FUS energy could be steered to the designated target position. FUS exposure was delivered in different patterns to induce
different scales of BBB opening. Typical BBB-opened and EBstained tissue sections induced by different exposure patterns are
shown in Fig. 10(b). The 400-kHz, 0.52-MPa exposure induced
a 8-mm-wide BBB-opened and EB-stained tissue region [see
Fig. 10(b), tissue sample 1] and the 600-kHz 0.52-MPa exposure
induced a 6-mm one (tissue sample 2). The 400/600-kHz exposure seemed to create a deeper-stained pattern in color than either
400 or 600 kHz exposures (see Fig. 10(b), tissue sample 3).
BBB opening with an exposure at increased pressure was also
demonstrated. Single point 0.78-MPa, 400-kHz exposure [see
Fig. 10(b), tissue sample 4] resulted in a wider (and more deeply
stained) BBB-opened region which appeared more irregular in
shape (7 mm wide and 15 mm long in this example). Conversely,
to test the capability of creating a square-shaped 20 × 20 mm2
BBB-opened region, a 0.52-MPa, 400-kHz multiple-point exposure was performed as an example [see Fig. 10(b), tissue sample 5]. In addition to the gross observation of EB-stained brain
sections, we spectrophotometrically quantified the concentrations of deposited EB dye in the BBB-opened animal brain (see
Fig. 11 and Table I). A control brain was used as a reference for
the lowest EB concentration (0.37 ± 0.13 μM). EB concentration showed a twofold increase (0.7 ± 0.13 μM) for a 0.52-MPa
400-kHz single-point exposure, and a smaller increase (0.66 ±
0.36 μM) for a 0.52-MPa 600-kHz single-point exposure. The
EB concentration was significantly increased when the pressure
was increased to 0.78 MPa (1.7 ± 0.5 μM; 400-kHz single-point
exposure). Interestingly, we observed that a wider BBB-opened
region was created by a 0.52-MPa 400-kHz multiple-point

exposure (3 × 3 points). The EB concentration was also significantly increased to a fivefold higher level than control (1.95
± 0.61 μM), suggesting that focal point overlapping provided
further improvement of EB penetration. On the other hand, 0.52MPa 400/600-kHz single-point exposure resulted in higher EB
penetration (1.22 ± 0.64 μM) than any single-frequency exposure at the same pressure level. This suggested that dualfrequency FUS-BBB opening provides an alternative to locally
increase drug penetration in addition to existing strategies of
either increasing acoustic pressure or performing multiple overlapping exposures.
Typical HE-stained brain sections are shown in Fig. 12, and
the occurrence of erythrocyte extravasations among FUS exposure patterns is summarized in Table II. Among all HE slides of
0.52-MPa single-frequency single-point exposures, a minority
of the brain sections (15.3% at 400 kHz and 10.0% at 600 kHz)
showed grouped extravasated erythrocytes. At increasing pressure (0.78 MPa), the occurrence of extravasations was significantly increased (66.7%). Applying 3 × 3 multiple exposures
also induced a high occurrence of extravasations (76.7%), implying that the pressure level in multiple exposures should be

reoptimized when intending to induce a large BBB-opened region. Of note, dual-frequency FUS exposure showed a similar
level of extravasations (12.5%), implying that it did not further
increase erythrocyte extravasation above the level obtained with
traditional single-frequency exposures.
IV. DISCUSSION
Our preliminary animal experiments demonstrated the feasibility of disrupting the BBB through an intact animal skull,
either in single or scanned target regions. Based on our transskull pressure measurement, in vivo animal experiments, as well
as previous studies of the efficiency of low-frequency ultrasound
to penetrate the skull [27], we assume that FUS produced by our
system will penetrate through the human skull. We successfully
demonstrated that dual-frequency excitation could be steered
spatially, and could also induce efficient targeting of BBB opening with improved EB penetration compared to single-frequency

1358

exposure. Unlike enhanced delivery obtained through increasing the pressure or performing repetitive/overlapped exposures,
dual-frequency exposure appears to increase BBB permeability
without worsening erythrocyte extravasation, therefore providing a new direction toward optimizing FUS-based brain drug
delivery. This study therefore provides useful design experience
of a multifrequency ultrasound phased array driving system, and
may also contribute toward the future design of arrays using various combinations of frequencies to improve transcranial FUS
brain-drug delivery efficiency.
Our novel FUS phased-array driving system was capable of
simultaneously exciting dual frequency output, thus demonstrating the feasibility of multiple frequency FUS exposure. Two distinct frequencies, both within the transducer bandwidth, could
be simultaneously driven. In addition, beat-frequency generation was feasible (±20 kHz off the center frequency). Beat
frequency generation was previously reported to be useful for
characterizing tissue properties or providing bubble/cavitation
feedback [41], [42], and could therefore be further explored as
an ultrasound-stimulated acoustic emission technique capable
of monitoring BBB opening and drug delivery. Subharmonic,
harmonic, or superharmonic frequency components were recently shown to accompany the BBB-opening process, and are
likely to correlate with inertial or stable bubble cavitation. Since
microbubble cavitation is the major mechanism for the induction of BBB opening, it could be used for direct monitoring
of BBB-opening during FUS exposure, and possibly also to
control the BBB-opening process [43]–[45]. In addition, the
frequency component could perhaps be manipulated to induce,
enhance, or manipulate FUS BBB opening. We demonstrated
that, within the transducer bandwidth (400–800 kHz), it is also
possible to provide main/subharmonic, main/superharmonic, or
main/harmonic dual frequency excitation. These different kinds
of dual frequency excitations could also serve as a useful platform to further investigate the benefits of dual-frequency exposure on brain drug delivery. In addition, the dual- or multiplefrequency excitation in this application may also have the potential to reduce the standing wave problem [46], that could possibly induce unwanted off-target brain lesions [24], [47]. Our
preliminary experiments demonstrated that at identical pressure levels, EB penetration appeared to be superior after dualfrequency FUS-BBB opening compared to single-frequency
treatment. Dual-frequency FUS-BBB opening may thus involve
enhanced cavitation, especially stable cavitation, since 600 kHz
is the ultraharmonic component of 400 kHz and is characteristic of stable cavitation. The exact mechanism of dual-frequency
FUS-enhanced BBB opening needs to be further investigated.
Depending on the type of medical device and desired market,
regulatory agencies enforce EMC standards that greatly impact
the design and marketability of electromedical devices. EMC
testing, which is required in most markets, helps to demonstrate
that the product’s emission quality does not affect the normal
operation of other medical devices in the same environment.
EM immunity tests also help to justify that EM emissions from
devices do not affect the normal operation of the designed system. For medical devices, EMC testing is primarily considered a
safety issue. High risk electrical and electronic medical devices

can be affected by EMI which can lead to potential malfunctioning causing inconvenient or even life threatening situations. IEC
60601-1-2 is a “pointer” standard that provides comprehensive
test levels and defines the pass/fail criteria that covers CISPR 11
for emissions and various IEC 61000 standards for immunity.
The emphasis of our study was on the design of an ultrasound phased-array driving system; however, development of
an image-guided procedure (such as MRI guidance [4]) is also
essential so that FUS energy can be correctly delivered to the
target position. Currently, the designed system does not provide
MR compatibility because: 1) the current coaxial cable length is
limited (3 m/channel); and 2) the coaxial cable does not provide
sufficient EM shielding and causes sustainable EM interference
to MRI. However, we demonstrated that EM conduction interference can be substantially suppressed with the added EMC
design, thus providing the opportunity to further improve MR
compatibility, which will be investigated in our future work.
An alternative image guidance system without requiring MR
compatibility is to use our previously proposed scheme which
incorporates a neuronavigation system to perform FUS exposure
guidance [26].
V. CONCLUSION
In this study, we presented a prototype design of a 256channel ultrasound phased-array system to perform localized
BBB disruption. To our knowledge, it is the first prototype of
a phased array that demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous, dual-frequency exposure from an ultrasound array. The
large animal experiments confirmed the feasibility of inducing
a large BBB-opened region by electronic scanning via phase
switching control, and also demonstrated the potential to enhance the BBB-opening effect through dual-frequency FUS exposure. This study is expected to contribute to the design of
an advanced ultrasound phased-array system for future clinical
applications of FUS-induced brain drug delivery.
