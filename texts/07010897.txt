Abstract—Objective: The investigation is aimed at the development of a semiautomatic method of examining the femoral and iliac
arteries, and quantifying atherosclerotic plaques visible in the multislice computed tomography images. Methods: We have utilized
the advanced morphology and segmentation methods for processing of a series of the images. In particular, a novel sorted pixel intensity approach to segment the artery into the lumen/plaque regions
has been used, and effectively combined with the Gaussian mixture
modeling to increase the accuracy of the segmentation. Results: Our
numerical results are compared with those obtained manually by
two experts. Statistics relevant to the progression of atherosclerosis
have also been suggested. Results of the semiautomatic tracking of
the femoral and iliac arteries and of the quantitative evaluation of
atherosclerotic alterations therein have been shown to correspond
well with the expert’s results. Conclusion: The developed system is
likely to be valuable tool for supporting the quantitative evaluation
of atherosclerotic changes in arteries. Significance: In its present
form the system can be used for planning surgical treatment and/or
predicting the course of the atherosclerotic alterations.

I. INTRODUCTION
N RECENT years, multislice computed tomography
(MSCT) has developed into a regular tool in medical diagnostics. One of the important MSCT applications is for imaging
arteries of patients with cardiovascular diseases. A multiplanar reconstruction method is used for providing the contrastenhanced 3-D visualization of the diseased vessels.
Vascular computed tomography (CT) imaging is a very useful
diagnostic tool used by cardiologists, radiologists, and surgeons
to plan interventional treatment strategies [1]. However, the

recent rendering techniques based on surface reconstruction and
volume building do not automatically reveal the interior structure of each element of interest. Different organs within slices of
similar radiodensity make it impossible to segment, and separate these objects by adjusting the volume-rendering parameters.
Therefore, it is difficult to quantitatively estimate with the acceptable precision atherosclerotic changes in the vessels based
on the MSCT images (a very useful tool for diagnosing various
stages of an arterial disease [2]). Indeed, the recognition of soft
plaques is the most difficult task because their radiodensity is
similar to that of the artery wall and of other soft components,
such as a thrombus, a thrombosed aneurysm, a pseudoaneurysm,
and an artery dissection site.
Recent progress in mathematical morphology (an excellent
overview of the morphological image processing and analysis is
given in Soille [3]) offers very efficient tools, which can be used
to develop the more advanced medical image analysis methods.
Such tools range from the low-level image-processing transformations (e.g., erosions, dilations, openings, and closings) to the
high-level transformations, such as the gray-level hit-or-miss
transform [4], the connected filtering based on component trees
[5], and such hierarchical operations as sequential thresholding [6]. These morphological methods in combination
with other segmentation techniques have been applied to
automatic or semiautomatic analyses of the vessels from different parts of the body, such as coronary [7]–[12], brain [13],
[14], liver and lung vessel tree [15], and carotid arteries [16].
Combination of some of these modified image preprocessing
methods with a few new methods, such as the sorted pixel
intensity approach, the extended regional maxima, etc., as
proposed in the present investigation, are likely to form a new
semiautomatic system of the artery tracing and segmentation
using the MSCT images.
Several recent reports [17]–[21] describe findings closely related to our present investigation. In one of these [17], a semiautomatic method for segmenting the arterial walls and plaques
in the in vitro vascular magnetic resonance (MR) images is
presented. Another paper [18] describes the application of a
segmentation model based on the contour detection and fuzzy
clustering of the MR images, as well as an automatic segmentation of the atherosclerotic carotid artery and characterization of
the plaques therein. Further improvement of the automatic analysis of plaques in this artery based on the MR images was also

reported [19]. Another study [20], applied a Gaussian mixture
model for extraction of coronary arteries to identify soft plaques
in the CT images. However, the lesion boundaries were manually edited. The published data notwithstanding, new ideas,
and further research is needed to improve and accelerate the
computer-supported segmentation of vessels and quantitative
analyses of the CT images.
In the present investigation, a computer software for semiautomatic artery tracking and for quantitative measurements of
atherosclerotic changes in the common iliac and femoral arteries
visualized in a sequence of CT images is proposed. Although
similar tools have been used to solve the segmentation problem
in various types of the vessels, no similar approach to the segmentation and quantification of the iliac and femoral arteries has
been reported. The tools that are described in the present report
are based on similar basic principles. However, the details of the
solution are different and are accommodated to the discussed
problem. Our approach had two important objectives: 1) An accurate extraction of the vessels from the sequence of CT images,
and b) a proper segmentation of the vessel planes into the lumen
and the plaque areas. Both regions will also be characterized
numerically. The first objective has been successfully met by
application of the extended regional maxima approach [3]. In
order to achieve the second objective, we had developed two
algorithms and compared their accuracy with that of the manual
approach.
Anatomical features [22] of the analyzed parts of the healthy
peripheral arteries are presented in Fig. 1. The main problem is
the automatic segmentation of the CT image sequence to localize
the artery, and to determine the distribution of its atherosclerotic
plaques.
The experimental part of our investigation is focused on the
applicability of our system to track arteries and to segment
atherosclerotic plaques therein. We base our conclusions on the
evaluation of a 121 diagnostic cases (patients), each involving
on average 270 MSCT images. Clinical applicability of the
results for quantification of atherosclerotic changes, as well as
different numerical parameters characterizing the femoral and
iliac arteries will be proposed and discussed.

Our approach differs from other methods previously used to
solve similar, but not the same, problems as follows.
1) We have used the extended regional maxima transformation to identify and track examine arteries in the sequence
of the MSCT images. This is a new approach to such a task.
2) We propose a novel sorted pixel intensity approach to segment the artery into the lumen/plaque regions, and have
effectively combined it with the Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) to increase the accuracy of the segmentation.
3) We verified in detail our system on 242 randomly selected
images obtained from 121 patients, and compared the
results to those obtained manually by two experts.
4) We compared the results of identifying and separating
the lumen from the plaque(s) obtained by the system and
those provided by the experts using a set of 2689 images
of the artery segments obtained from many patients and
demonstrated a close similarity of the results.
5) We have defined quantitative statistical parameters of
atherosclerotic alterations, and used the developed system
for numerical estimation of these alterations using the data
from 121 patients (approximately 270 images per patient).
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Patients
Our results are based on the evaluation of MSCT images of the iliac and femoral arteries obtained from 121 patients with different stages of atherosclerotic disease. All the
patients were candidates for endovascular or surgical intervention, as diagnosed at the Department of Vascular Surgery of
the Military Institute of Medicine in Warsaw. The patients aged
from 40 to 86 years (mean 65 years). Sixty-seven patients were
between 59 and 74 years of age and presented with various
cardiac problems, 79 suffered from hypertension, and 86 from
coronary artery disease. The detailed characteristics of the patients participating in the experiments is presented in Table I.
The CT images were collected from 2006 to 2010. Overall,
434 different arterial segments were analyzed. Only the arteries whose lumens were continuously imaged were taken into

account. Others, when the continuous imaging was not possible,
or those with an aneurysm were excluded from the investigation.
All the images were collected at the Department of Radiology
of the Military Institute of Medicine in Warsaw with use of a
64-slice General Electric MSCT (Fairfield, CT, USA). CT of
the iliac and femoral arteries was performed using a standard
contrast-enhanced protocol (120 kVp, 180 mAs, collimation
64 × 0.625 mm, pitch 0.5). All the patients were injected with
150 ml of the contrast medium (Iomeron 400 mg/ml; Bracco,
U.K.) with SmartPrep.
The images were reconstructed with a 250 mm field of view,
512 × 512 matrix size, 0.625 mm slice thickness, and 0.625
increments using a standard reconstruction filter and were stored
in the DICOM format version 3.

there is no general rule how to make the choice. The h value
should be selected according to a specific application. In our
case, it should be chosen so as to provide the proper segmentation in different cases of the lesions (existence or nonexistence
of the calcified and noncalcified plaques). The cases of noncalcified plaques define the upper limit on h, which allows to properly
distinguish between the lumen and the surrounding area of the
vessel border. On the other side, the cases of calcified plaques
define the lower limit of h, which enables appropriate segmentation of the lumen. Based on the analyses of many images,
we have found that the value of h = 40 leads to the best results
for most MSCT images. Indeed, only for very thin arteries, this
value of h would not adequately identify the artery area. In this
case, the algorithm may not be able to localize the artery. If
this happens, the algorithm automatically switches to other
values of h = 60 and h = 80. Consequently, the final result of
the segmentation is the logical sum of two extended regional
maxima transformations for the assumed values of h. As
indicated by our experience, the developed extended regional
maxima transformation approach always led to a proper
extraction of the artery.

B. Extraction of the Arteries
To identify and track the selected arteries in a sequence of
the MSCT images, we used the extended regional maxima approach [3], [23] and other basic morphological operations. The
extended regional maxima transform is a morphological transformation that suppresses the regional maxima in the gray scale
image, whose height is bigger than the assumed threshold level
h [3], [23].
In the first step of the algorithm, a marker image is created
by subtracting the assumed threshold h from the original pixel
intensity. In the next step, this marker is used to transform the
original image into a mask. The resulting image contains only
the flat regions of the local maxima corresponding to the original
intensity levels that exceed the surrounding pixels by at least the
value of h. Finally, a binary mask is created by locating regional
maxima areas. These operations produce regional maxima, the
intensity of which is greater than that of the lower intensity
surrounding regions by h (Fig. 2).
The choice of the value of h is important for distinguishing of
the objects from the background in the vessel image. However,

C. Tracking Artery in a Sequence of CT Images
Fig. 3 shows orientation of the xyz-coordinate system and
organization of the MSCT slices. Our investigation involves
tracking of the iliac and femoral arteries beginning from their
branching off from the aorta up to the femoral artery division
into the superficial and deep femoral arteries [22].
The analysis begins from below the latter division, and the
exact starting point should be chosen manually by marking a
point indicating the appropriate artery (left or right). Further
analysis of a slice sequence is performed automatically until the
aorta is reached.
The general procedure of artery tracking in a sequence of
scans is presented in Fig. 4. The order of the algorithm steps
is numbered. Each image in the sequence of the MSCT slices
is analyzed by applying the extended regional maxima transformation followed by the filtering process. In this step, we
use a disk-shaped structuring element with a 1 pixel radius in
the opening and closing operations. The resulting binary image
contains not only markers for the artery area, but also for other

separated objects, such as bones or smaller vessels. To select a
proper artery plane in the following slice, the previous image
is used as a marker in reconstruction of the appropriate objects.
This approach prevents small vessels from being analyzed as
the main artery.
Because of the anatomical structure of the vessels under study,
two specific branching sites of the analyzed arteries must be
considered: One corresponding to the branching of the iliac
artery, and the second corresponding to the branching of the
femoral artery. Early detection of these sites allows us to more
precisely and adequately evaluating the subsequent sections of
the artery. The location of the femoral branching can be detected
as the point where the local artery area increases by more than
20% with respect to the previous slice. This will be the first
point of a possible increase in the artery’s area in the course of
the analysis of a sequence of scans.
The area and the vertical (y-axis in Fig. 3) coordinate of the
artery, as well as practical experience have been used to build
an effective algorithm for detection of the iliac branching. The
site of this branching should be close to the lowest value of
the vertical coordinate of the artery found in the sequence of
images. The algorithm searches for an abrupt increase in the
artery area in the MSCT slice sequence beginning from the 30th
image (approximately 2 cm) before the image slice with the
lowest vertical coordinate value within the sequence. If no point
with increased area is detected in this region, the lowest vertical
coordinate in a sequence is regarded as the location of the iliac
branch. This rule was applied to all the studied tomograms and
provided acceptable results.
D. Identification of Atherosclerotic Plaques
After extracting the artery, the next step is to separate the
arterial lumen and the regions occupied by atherosclerotic
plaques. This separation is important for evaluating the degree
of atherosclerotic changes in the artery. The arterial lumen and
plaques (calcified or noncalcified) within the extracted artery
areas must be identified. However, there are three different representations of artery changes that must be considered in this
automatic identification process:

1493

1) One class only (the lumen): all pixels represent the arterial
lumen containing the contrasted blood;
2) Two classes (the lumen and the calcified plaques): some
pixels represent the arterial lumen and some the calcified
atherosclerotic plaques;
3) Three classes (the lumen, the calcified plaques, and the
noncalcified plaques): some pixels represent the arterial
lumen, some represent the calcified plaques, and some
represent the noncalcified plaques.
In practice, significant changes in intensity can be found
within the classes of the CT images. These changes occur not
only between slices obtained from different patients, but also
within a single sequence of slices from one patient. The variations result from different distributions of a contrast medium
in the arteries. The observed differences between the estimated
threshold values allowing to distinguish the calcified plaques
from the lumen were quite large: e.g., 392 Hounsfield units
(HU) for one slice, 516 HU for another slice, and 606 HU for
yet another slice. The erroneous estimation of this threshold may
change the calculated ratio of the plaque-to-the lumen area.
Our analyses of many images indicated that the curves of the
sorted pixel intensities of the extracted artery planes had very
characteristic shapes. A segment of these curves corresponding
to the plaque regions has a steeper slope than that the one corresponding to pixels representing the lumen area. Additional statistical experiments were performed on 100 images. The mean
ratio of the plaque area to the total artery area as estimated by
the experts was 10.7%. The respective mean obtained with the
proposed automatic thresholding was 11%. Overestimation of
the threshold value by 2% led to a decrease in this ratio from
11% to 9.2% (a 1.8% change). In contrast, when the threshold
was underestimated by 2%, this ratio rose from 11% to 15% (a
4% change). These results indicate that underestimation of the
threshold value increases the risk of a more faulty estimation of
the ratio.
Table II illustrates the sorted pixel intensity curves (last column) corresponding to different atherosclerotic changes of the
arteries. These curves represent pixels of the artery area in the
actual cross section (MSCT image) and belong to the lumen and
the plaques’ regions. The length of each curve depends on the
number of pixels in a particular cross section and may vary from
case to case. Case A represents healthy common femoral arteries
without any plaques and serves as a reference scan. The slope of
the sorted pixel intensity curve is nearly horizontal (minimum
variance). Case B shows the external iliac arteries with small,
calcified atherosclerotic plaques represented by a short segment
of steeper slope on the right side of the curve. Case C shows
the common iliac arteries with a small number of calcified and
noncalcified atherosclerotic plaques. At both ends of the curve
short segments of steeper slope (high variance in the pixel intensity) can be seen. Case D illustrates the external iliac arteries
with significant calcified plaques (indicated on the arteries in the
middle column of the table). A significant change in the slope
occurs within the large region on the right side of the curve.
Case E represents the common femoral arteries with clearly
separated regions of the calcified and noncalcified plaques. As
in case C, these plaques are represented by significant changes

in the slope at both ends of the sorted pixel intensity curve. For
healthy arteries (case A), the sorted pixel intensity curve is uniform with a very gentle slope. For the calcified and noncalcified
plaques significant changes in the slopes between the lumen and
the plaques areas can be seen.
These observations were implemented in the image processing procedure. The atherosclerotic plaques were separated from
the lumen area by estimating the trend of the sorted pixel intensity curve and splitting it into segments of the gentle and steeper
slopes. The inflexion point suggests the threshold value, which
separates the artery area into the lumen and the plaque regions.
This point is identified by approximating the sorted pixel intensity curve with a polynomial function and, then, calculating
its derivative. The character of the sorted pixel intensity curve
requires high degree polynomials to fit the data. We found that a
12th degree polynomial approximation was sufficient. We tested
other possible solutions, including the spline approximation and
the multilayer perceptron [24], and obtained similar results.
Fig. 5(a) and (c) gives examples of the 12th degree polynomial
approximation of the sorted pixel intensity curves for cases D
and C from Table II, respectively. After differentiation of these
polynomials the curves of the first derivatives were obtained,
as shown in Fig. 5(b) and (d), respectively. The pixel intensity
at the abrupt change in the value of the first derivative corresponds to the threshold value for separation of the lumen and
the plaque regions in the artery plane. We found that the optimal
threshold for the proper segmentation of the artery plane into the
calcified atherosclerotic plaque and the lumen should be set at a
point where the slope of the pixel intensity curve is greater than
four per pixel. This point was regarded as the abrupt change
in the slope. The derivative value of four provided the best

segmentation of the artery plane into the lumen and the plaques
and best agreed with the manual results in all our experiments,
including the areas representing only the lumen, the lumen and
the calcified plaques, and the lumen with both types of the
plaques. Due to the considerable steepness of the derivative
curve in this region, a slight change in this particular value of
the threshold was not associated with a significant alteration of
the segmentation results. For example, experiments performed
on a set of 2258 tomogram slices obtained from ten patients
indicated that at a ±10% change of the threshold value for the
derivative, the difference in the estimated plaque to total artery
area ratio was below 0.08% with respect to the expert results.
In the search for the best segmentation method, we also used
the GMM. The details of this approach were described previously [25]. Mixture modeling thresholding is based on the
assumption that the pixel values of the image represent a multimodal density. The modes are the bumps in the image histogram
and correspond to the regions of the image with the relatively
high number of pixels that reach these pixel values. Initialization of the classes (bumps) is started by applying the K-means
clustering with K = 3. GMM optimizes the split of the pixels
into three possible classes represented by the Gaussian functions of different means and standard deviations by applying
the expectation maximization algorithm [25]. Once a Gaussian
mixture model is fitted to the probability density function of
the image, the pixels can be assigned to different classes based
on the final estimation of posterior probabilities, i.e., assigning pixel xj to the class that produces the highest probability.
The optimal threshold is determined as the intersection point of
two neighboring Gaussian functions. With respect to the three
classes under consideration (the lumen, the calcified, and the
noncalcified plaques), three bumps will be approximated by
three Gaussian functions of different centers. At the joint points
of these functions, we get the optimal threshold points separating these three classes (the first point separates class 1 and 2,
and the second separates class 2 and 3). In this way, the GMM
method leads directly to the location of two possible threshold
values for recognition between the lumen, the calcified, and the
noncalcified plaques.

MARKIEWICZ et al.: COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM FOR QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC PLAQUES

Let us consider the most general case of dividing the artery
plane into three regions: two sections with the steepest slope in
the sorted pixel intensity separated by a middle section with a
gentle slope [e.g., Fig. 5(c)]. In this general case, we assume
three classes in the extracted artery: the lumen, the calcified
plaques, and the noncalcified plaques. Our approach automatically identifies the proper class by adding a step that evaluates
the variance in pixel intensity within each region. Our experimental results showed that when the variance of the pixels for
the region with the largest mean is smaller than 3000, the calcified atherosclerotic plaques are not present in this region, and all
the pixels represent the arterial lumen (one class region). Otherwise, the pixels of this region represent calcified atherosclerotic
plaques (noncalcified plaques may only occur in the region with
the lowest means). In the latter case, when the considered pixels
represent calcified plaques, we must decide whether the middle
region represents the lumen or the calcified plaques. To solve
this dilemma, we analyzed the sorted pixel intensity variance.
When the variance of the pixel intensity in the middle region
is greater than 10 000, the region represents calcified plaques,
otherwise the region is in the lumen. When the middle region
represents the plaque area, the class with the lowest mean represents the lumen (we exclude cases with no lumen). When
the middle class has been recognized as the lumen, we should
check whether the region of the lowest pixel intensity represents
noncalcified (soft) plaques.
The problem of recognizing soft components has been solved
in two steps. First, GMM segmentation of the artery region
was applied after excluding the area of the calcified plaques
(already identified). Next, the inner artery wall contour was
ellipsoidally approximated. Before the application of the GMM
segmentation, the region is extended by adding a 1-pixel-wide
rim. This way cross-sectional area of the artery is enlarged by the
pixels adjacent to the cross-section’s border, which represent the
noncontrasted region belonging to the artery wall of the intensity
comparable to that of the soft plaques. As a result, the group of
the low radiodensity pixels representing the noncalcified plaques
is enlarged. Consequently, the boundary pixels with radiodensity
of the potential soft plaques better impact the segmentation and
accurate division of the considered region into the lumen and
the soft plaques (two classes) using GMM.
It should be noted that the above procedure allowed to solve
cases with and without soft plaques. When the analyzed arteries
were devoid of soft plaques, the threshold value differentiated
between the artery wall (pixels added only to the GMM input
data) and the artery area. Otherwise, the threshold value would
differentiate between the soft plaques and the artery lumen.
Thus, in the first case, no soft plaque area is separated from the
artery cross section, while in the second case soft plaques are
extracted.
However, not all soft plaque regions can be discovered in
this way. Some of their fragments may resemble the artery wall
and might be overlooked in the course of the extended regional
maxima transformation and, as a result, be absent from the
artery region. Therefore, in the second step, we used ellipsoidal
approximation of the inner artery wall contour preserving the
area of the artery [26].

Fig. 7. Comparison of the selected threshold values estimated with the GMM
and APX methods.

The regions not belonging to the lumen and the calcified
plaques, which were inside this ellipse, were also treated as soft
plaques. Results of this procedure are presented in Fig. 6, which
shows the original image of the artery [see Fig. 6(a)] and the
outcomes of the segmentation [see Fig. 6(b)]. The brown line in
Fig. 6(b) outlines the contour of the artery cross section obtained
by the extended regional maxima method. The blue line marks
the calcified plaques recognized by GMM thresholding, and the
yellow line marks the soft plaques recognized in the first step of
our procedure. The ellipsoidal approximation of the artery area
also includes the artery cross section, which was not contained
within the brown line. The ellipse’s area neither belonging to
the lumen nor the calcified plaques is added to the yellow region
and forms the final area of the soft plaques. In this particular
case, the accuracy of recognition of the soft plaques, as assessed
by the experts, equaled to 95.2%.
Fig. 7 illustrates the results of threshold estimation with GMM
and the polynomial approximations (APX) of two sample images. The images represent cases with calcified plaques.
For the case shown in Fig. 7(a), the APX and GMM methods
yielded the thresholds of 518 and 537 HU, respectively. The
difference between the estimated ratios of the lumen decrease
obtained from these two thresholds was 0.9% (11.3 mm2 of
the plaque area calculate with APX and 9.0 mm2 of the plaque
area calculate with GMM relative to 257 mm2 of the total artery
area). For the case shown in Fig. 7(b), the APX and GMM methods yielded the thresholds of 486 and 521 HU, respectively.
The difference between the estimated ratios of the lumen decrease obtained from these two thresholds was 2.6% (33.6 mm2
of the plaque area calculate with APX and 30.9 mm2 of the

1496

plaque area calculate with GMM relative to 104 mm2 of the
total artery area).
Analysis of the numerical results obtained by our system for
many images justifies the use of the higher of the two threshold
values estimated by the APX and the GMM methods. This
strategy is likely to prevent underestimation of the threshold,
which may lead to a significant change in the plaque-to-the
lumen areas ratio. Although such an approach may, in some
cases, results in overestimation of the plaque area, this is less
dangerous for a patient than the underestimation.
Statistical results of the segmentation using APX and GMM
showed no significant superiority of any of these methods. However, since the Gaussian mixture model assumes normal distribution of different components (i.e., the lumen, the calcified,
and the noncalcified plaques) [20], in cases when the normal
distribution is violated (e.g., when a blood contrast in nonhomogeneously propagated in the lumen), we recommend to use
the APX method.
In order to increase the stability and accuracy of the thresholding, the threshold value obtained for a given slice is averaged over the values obtained from the preceding five slices in a
MSCT series. This type of a “forward” approach was used in order to perform the thresholding during the artery tracking. Such
procedure can be applied for both the GMM and APX methods
henceforth abbreviated GMMwM (GMM with the mean) and
APXwM (APX with the mean). This approach will allow to
incorporate the actual experience into the processing of MSCT
image sequences.

E. Descriptive Measures of Arterial Pathology
After identifying the arterial lumen and atherosclerotic plaque
areas, we should automatically provide their numerical description using statistical methods. One of the most important
factors for planning surgical treatment is the reduction of the
arterial lumen defined as the ratio of the lumen (the area without atherosclerotic plaques) to the total area of the lumen and
plaques combined. Another important parameter is the area of
the ellipse circumscribed on the identified cross section of the
artery. This area can be regarded as an approximation of the
original (natural) inner area of the artery wall. The ellipse was
fitted to the cross section of the artery by applying the minimum
volume enclosing ellipsoids [26]. This method uses the first and
second moments of the data points to compute the parameters of
an ellipsoid that covers most of the points of the cross section.
Based on the above discussion, the following statistical parameters of atherosclerotic changes were defined.
1) Mean reduction (in percentages) of the arterial lumen area
calculated for all sequences of the MSCT images and for
each anatomical part of the artery.
2) Maximum reduction (in percentages) of the arterial lumen
area determined for all sequences of the MSCT images and
for each anatomical part of the artery.
3) Mean arterial lumen area of the common iliac and femoral
arteries without branches calculated for all sequences of
the MSCT images (in mm2 ).

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 6, JUNE 2015

4) Minimum arterial lumen area of the common iliac and
femoral arteries without branching determined for all sequences of the MSCT images (in mm2 ).
5) Mean reduction (in percentages) of the arterial lumen approximated by an ellipse for the common iliac and femoral
arteries without branching.
6) The ratio of the number of slices with atherosclerotic
plaques to the total number of the analyzed images in
the artery MSCT sequence determined separately for the
common iliac and femoral arteries without branching.
The complete procedure leading to the numerical description
of the parameters of the artery was implemented in a graphical
user interface using the MATLAB platform [23]. The user has
only to select the image folder, upload the proper file, and select
the first and the last image from the CT slice sequence for the
analysis. Next, two markers pointing to the left and right arteries
in the first image of the sequence are located manually. The
program subsequently performs all the necessary operations on
the image sequence without any manual intervention from the
user. The results of the analysis are stored as numerical values of
the defined parameters of atherosclerosis and also as graphical
representations of the segmentations of all the analyzed MSCT
images.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Preliminary Assessment of the CT Image Sequences
Before the beginning of the investigation all the potential
patients were manually examined by a physician to exclude
those who did not meet the initial requirements. Based on this,
the following cases were found among the 128 patients.
1) Two cases with total occlusion of the investigated right
and left arteries (excluded from evaluation).
2) Thirteen cases with continuous blood flow only in the
right artery (accepted for evaluation).
3) Twelve cases with continuous blood flow only in the left
artery (accepted for evaluation).
4) Three cases with a too low signal-to-noise ratio in the
images (excluded from evaluation).
5) Two cases with the CT imaging quality problems (excluded from evaluation).
6) Three cases requiring additional manual intervention to
correct for the branching identification in the CT sequence
(accepted for evaluation).
Thus, after excluding the seven cases, the remaining 121
patients were eventually included in the investigation (success
rate of 94.5%).
To validate the quality of our system results of the automatic
analyses were confirmed by visual evaluations performed by two
independent experts. Our results have been presented as graphs
demonstrating the extracted artery planes segmented into the
lumen and plaque areas and as descriptive numerical values.
B. Graphical Results of Segmentation

images were obtained through application of the polynomial
approximation of the sorted pixel intensity curve. In row (a), a
fragment of the image of the arteries without plaques is shown.
The variance of 487 of the sorted pixel intensity indicates that
the lumens are free of the plaques. Row (b) depicts splitting of
the artery area into the lumen and the calcified plaques. The
optimal threshold value in this case was 527 HU. Finally, row
(c) represents a case with three classes: the lumen, the calcified
plaque area (highlighted by a blue line), and the noncalcified
plaque area (delineated in yellow). In the last case, two threshold values of 451 and 226 HU were used for the lumen and the
calcified and noncalcified plaques, respectively.
C. Validation of the System
In order to verify the quality of our estimations, the automatic
segmentations of the artery area into the lumen and the plaques
were compared with the manual assessments performed by two
experts denoted as Expert 1 (MD) and Expert 2 (MM): the former has practiced vascular imaging for more than 11 years and
the latter 2 for more than 30 years. For the assessments, MSCT
image sequences obtained from ten randomly chosen patients
were used (the number of images in one sequence varied from
220 to 320 and the images covered all the analyzed sections of
the arteries). For the automatic estimations, two of the most successful approaches were taken: the polynomial approximation
and the GMM. Additionally, in both cases online adaptation of
the threshold value for the following slice was implemented by
using the average from the last six threshold values.
In Fig. 9 rates of the decrease in the arterial lumen area for
the successive MSCT images from one patient are compared.
Fig. 9(a) presents all the plots in a common coordinate system,
and Fig. 9(b) shows the difference between the mean of the results of the two experts (denoted as Expert) and the GMMwM
and APXwM results. The outcomes of both methods are

consistent with each other and with that of the experts. The general trend for the lumen reduction was similarly detected with
all the methods used, although there were small discrepancies
between the results. The GMMwM results (the relative lumen
decrease) are, in most cases, underestimated. This might result
from a not exactly normal distribution of the pixel intensities
for different regions of the image.
Table III presents quantitative assessment of the discrepancies
between the automatic and manual results expressed as means
and standard deviations of the lumen decrease rate for all the
analyzed slice sequences from Fig. 9. The difference between
these results is regarded as an error of the semiautomatic system.
The obtained data indicate that, practically in all cases, the
outcomes of the APXwM and GMMwM methods concurred

well with the results of the experts. The mean estimated difference between the two automatic methods and the results of
the experts was low (below 2%). In medical practice, such errors are fully acceptable. In a very limited number of slices,
estimation errors increased resulting in the high standard deviation relative to the mean. In a few extreme cases, the maximum
absolute error exceeded 15% (APXwM algorithm). A similar
range of maximum differences was also observed between the
experts. This single increase in error might be caused by inhomogeneities of the applied contrast medium or the erratic blood
flow in some parts of the vessels. Careful analysis of the results
has revealed that maximum discrepancies occurred at the points
of branching of the femoral artery where the real lumen narrowing was not critical. For example, according to the experts
and to APXwM, the lumen area decreased by 45% and 30%,
respectively. Depending on vascular pathology and the clinical
status of a patient, the critical sites can be differently interpreted.
The biggest difference (15%) between the two estimations was
observed at the branching of the femoral artery. Such a reduction in the blood flow can significantly impact nutrition of the
lower limb. However, it is less important in terms of planning
the endovascular intervention.
Recognition of soft plaques is also important. Our approach
to this issue, presented in the previous section, was tested on
50 images taken from different tomograms with this type of
plaques. In these images, mean area of soft plaques estimated
by the experts was 8.38 mm2 , while according to the automatic
evaluation it was 7.25 mm2 . Hence, the average accuracy can
be estimated as 86.5%.
The following numerical comparison is presented for the results of a group of 20 patients (20 pairs of arteries) randomly
selected from all the investigated cases. These patients were analyzed using threshold values chosen manually by one expert,
and the values automatically generated with the two methods
(GMMwM and APXwM). Means and standard deviations of the
mean, the maximum lumen decrease, and mean absolute errors

(MAE) for these values are shown in Table IV (the experts’ estimations are presented as reference values). MAE was calculated
as the average of the absolute difference between the experts’
and the GMMwM/APXwM results for the sequence of all the
analyzed slices. The results presented for the left (L) and right
(R) arteries testify for the high quality of our developed system.
The two automatic methods of segmentation appeared to be
comparable to each other even though slightly better results
were obtained with the GMMwM method (1.2% mean MAE
for GMMwM compared to 2.6% for APXwM). To compare the
distribution of the mean lumen decrease values in our GMMwM
algorithm with the expert’s results, a sign test was used. The
probability p of rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no
difference between the two results was 1.08E-6, confirming an
excellent agreement between them. The correlation coefficient
between the experts’ and the GMMwM results was 0.9904,
and the correlation coefficient between the GMMwM and the
APXwM results was 0.9261.
We processed the original images directly obtained from the
individual MSCT slices in the computerized analysis. We estimated all the parameters (the lumen and the plaque areas) in the
MSCT cross sections. However, these values can also be recalculated for orthogonal planes using a mapping technique based
on the multiscale centerline tracking as described by Renard
and Yang [12]. Such transformed results may differ from the
original estimation, and this difference depends on the general
shape and course of the artery.
Table V presents mean and maximum values, as well as MAE
of the arterial lumen decrease rate recalculated for the above described 20 patients. The results might differ from case to case
and are dependent on the tortuosity of the arteries: in tortuous arteries, the differences are more pronounced. This is important when estimating a local narrowing of the artery. For
the centerline results, we also performed appropriate statistical
equivalence tests. The sign test compares the distribution of the
mean lumen decrease values obtained by GMMwM with those

obtained by the experts. The actual p value was 4.13E-5 confirming the null hypothesis of the equality of the results.
The estimated correlation coefficient between the experts’ and
the GMMwM results was now 0.9880, and that between the
GMMwM and APXwM results was 0.9466. The sign test
comparing the results before and after the centerline tracking confirmed the statistical equivalence of both approaches
at p = 4.13E − 5 for the GMMwM results and p = 4.26E − 6
for the experts’ results.
Other comparisons also directly demonstrated the consistency
between the results of the manual and computerized systems
when estimating parameters for the lumen and the plaques.
These comparisons were performed for a set of 242 images
(two randomly selected images from each of the 121 analyzed
patients). All the analyzed images contained atherosclerotic
plaques. The images were evaluated by experts who manually
segmented the lumen and the plaques (by drawing on the slices).
The areas of these two regions were calculated based on this step.
Their results were used to validate our semiautomatic system
for the same images.
Table VI summarizes the statistical results and lists the mean
values and standard deviations for the combined lumen and
plaque areas and the average ratio of the plaque area to the
total area of the artery. It also presents the mean and standard
deviation of the difference between the results of the experts
and those of the semiautomatic systems. The average difference between the mean values of the total area (the lumen and
the plaque) estimated by the experts and by our system was
3.13 mm2 corresponding to a relative value of 3.3%. For the average ratio of the plaque area to the total artery area the average
difference was 1.29%, i.e., 12.4% in relative terms. Fig. 10(a)
demonstrates a relationship between the total area (the lumen
and the plaque) calculated by our system and the area manually
drawn by the experts for all the 242 analyzed images.

correlation between the automatic and manual measurement
pairs was excellent (average correlation coefficient of R =
0.987 is better than the R = 0.91 previously reported for MR
of the carotid artery [18]), and 2) the average paired difference
between both approaches was −3.1 mm2 (−3.3%) at p < 0.05,
showing a slight area underestimation; these results are also better than those presented in a previous study [18], which reported
a value −5.56 mm2 for a similar mean artery area. It should be
noted, however, that the compared results come from a study
[18], in which a different imaging technique (MR) was used for
evaluations of different (carotid) arteries.
Similar effects were observed when estimating the plaqueto-artery area ratio. Fig. 10(b) demonstrates the relationship
between the quantitative estimation of this ratio obtained by a
semiautomatic system and the manually drawn area for the same
set of 242 images. The mean correlation coefficient value R was
0.89. The average difference between the two approaches was
−1.29% at p < 0.05. Our system tended to slightly underestimate this ratio. Three outliers which significantly differed from
other points were carefully analyzed and compared with the respective vessel images. In these three cases the main source of
error was underestimation of the threshold in the segmentation
process of the plaque area caused by the awkward shape of the
sorted pixel intensity curve. This could result from 1) a very
small area of a calcified plaque (a poor representation of this
type of lesions in automatic recognition process), or 2) inhomogeneous contrasting of the lumen. Consequently, there was an
overestimation of the plaque area in the three outliers.
Fig. 11 presents the Bland and Altman plots [27] of the lumen
[see Fig. 11(a)], the plaque [see Fig. 11(b)], the total area of the
lumen and the plaque [see Fig. 11(c)], and the proportion of
slices with the plaques [see Fig. 11(d)]. These results confirm
that: 1) there is no systematic bias between the results of the two
approaches, 2) the errors have a random distribution of a small
magnitude with most within ±1.96 std, and 3) the estimated
differences in the areas of the lumen and the plaques as well as

in the proportion of slices with plaques are independent of the
vessel size.
In view of the rapidly developing transcatheter aortic valve
implantation (TAVI) procedure for the miniinvasive treatment of
patients presenting with aortic valve stenosis and a high surgical
risk, it is important to gauge the applicability of our system for
the analysis of the vessels less than 5 mm in diameter. Hence,
we performed complementary experiments using 100 of the
randomly chosen images of such vessels. The images were analyzed twice by the two experts and also by our system. The
experts assessed the diameters based on the maximum radius of
the circle inscribed in the plaque-free lumen area.
The Bland and Altman plots of the average vessel diameters
are presented in Fig. 12: a plot from the experts’ results is shown
in Fig. 12(a), while the differences between the results of our
system and the experts’s averages are indicated in Fig. 12(b).
Apparently, no systematic bias between the results of these two
approaches could be detected. The mean value of the differences
between the experts’ and the computer evaluations was less than
2 mm.
As shown in Fig. 12, the points are randomly distributed
around the mean which means that the differences in estimations
were independent of the vessel size.
D. Statistical Results of Evaluations of Atherosclerosis for
All Cases
Detailed examinations of arteries usually involve statistical
calculation of their parameters (e.g., but not exclusively, the
lumen decrease rate) which play a role in making decisions for
surgery. From this perspective the most important parameters
are:
F1 mean decrease in the artery lumen area [%];
F2 maximum decrease in the artery lumen area [%];
F3 mean area of the artery lumen [mm2 ];
F4 minimum area of the artery lumen [mm2 ];
F5 mean decrease in the femoral artery lumen area [%];
F6 mean decrease in the iliac artery lumen area [%];
F7 mean lumen decrease relative to the ellipse area in the
artery [%];
F8 mean lumen decrease relative to the ellipse area in the

Estimation of such a great number of parameters is only possible using a computerized system as, in practice, no single
expert is capable of assessing them manually. For the final
investigation of atherosclerotic plaques, we used the entire
database of the 121 selected patients.
Table VII lists statistical parameters (F1 to F9) calculated
for the left and right arteries. The parameters were estimated
for all the patients included in the investigation. In the table
mean values and standard deviations as well as their ranges are
presented.
As indicated, the obtained measures varied widely in different patients depending on the stage of atherosclerosis. No
significant differences could be detected between the left and
the right arteries. The sign test was used to estimate the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no difference
between the paired data for the right and the left arteries. The
calculations resulted in p = 0.039 and the correlation between
means obtained for the right and the left arteries was excellent
(R = 0.9995).
IV. CONCLUSION
Evaluation of the arteries with use of the MSCT imaging
aided by computer methods is one of the most promising tools
in medical diagnostics. In this study, a semiautomatic system for
the quantitative evaluation of atherosclerotic alterations in the
iliac and femoral arteries is presented. The system’s algorithms
are based on mathematical morphology, statistical parameters,
and a combination of the logical rules creating together a special
type of a decision tree.
The first step in our algorithm is localization and tracking
of the artery area in the sequence of the MSCT images. This
was successfully accomplished by a segmentation procedure
utilizing the extended regional maxima transformation.
Another important result of our investigation is the development of the algorithm, which effectively separates the extracted
artery plane area into the lumen and the plaque portions. Because
of the complex nature of the segmentation two different methods were applied: polynomial approximation and the GMM. A
highly satisfying performance of these methods was achieved by
an adaptive approach for determining the threshold value. This

1501

approach was implemented in the form of the APXwM and
GMMwM procedures. As a result, sufficiently accurate results
of practical value have been obtained.
The system developed by us may well be applied for the preoperative assessment of the ilio-femoral regions of the arteries.
Indeed, it can effectively support the quantitative evaluation of
changes in the atherosclerotic arteries. In its present form, the
system can also be used for planning of the surgical treatment
and/or diagnosing of the progress of atherosclerosis. Moreover,
it is suited for the analysis of very small arteries. Thus, it may
also be used for preoperative evaluations of the “TAVI subjects,” i.e., patients scheduled for the transfemoral aortic valve
replacement.
One of the debatable issues of the described methodology
relates to segmentation of the soft plaques whose pixels’ intensities are very similar to those of the artery wall. This has
been solved by using two complementary approaches resulting
in almost 90% accurate estimation of the soft plaques’ area.
In future, we will also use another strategy, as suggested by,
e.g., Raman et al. [2]. The second issue is the occasionally
encountered low-quality MSCT images. This may be due to
the nonuniform contrast medium or erratic blood flow in some
parts of the examined vessels. The quality of the obtained images could thus be improved by using advanced preprocessing
tools.
