Abstract—Irreversible electroporation (IRE) ablation uses brief
electric pulses to kill a volume of tissue without damaging the
structures contraindicated for surgical resection or thermal ablation, including blood vessels and ureters. IRE offers a targeted
nephron-sparing approach for treating kidney tumors, but the relevant organ-specific electrical properties and cellular susceptibility
to IRE electric pulses remain to be characterized. Here, a pulse protocol of 100 electric pulses, each 100 μs long, is delivered at 1 pulse/s
to canine kidneys at three different voltage-to-distance ratios while
measuring intrapulse current, completed 6 h before humane euthanasia. Numerical models were correlated with lesions and electrical measurements to determine electrical conductivity behavior
and lethal electric field threshold. Three methods for modeling tissue response to the pulses were investigated (static, linear dynamic,
and asymmetrical sigmoid dynamic), where the asymmetrical sigmoid dynamic conductivity function most accurately and precisely
matched lesion dimensions, with a lethal electric field threshold of
575 ± 67 V/cm for the protocols used. The linear dynamic model
also attains accurate predictions with a simpler function. These
findings can aid renal IRE treatment planning under varying electrode geometries and pulse strengths. Histology showed a wholly
necrotic core lesion at the highest electric fields, surrounded by a
transitional perimeter of differential tissue viability dependent on
renal structure.

incidentally, including nonaggressive tumors and renal cell carcinomas with low incidence of metastatic progression [1]. In
response, nephron-sparing approaches are being used more
commonly to eliminate abnormal masses while conserving renal
function in the healthy parenchyma [2]; particularly for patients
with comorbidities, multiple renal carcinoma nodules, or genetic predisposition for recurrent tumors. Such techniques, including partial nephrectomies and thermal ablation [3], achieve
comparable medium-term outcomes to radical nephrectomy [4].
Thermal techniques are often limited to tumors ࣘ3 cm in noncentral regions due to blood perfusion thermal sink and potential
collecting system damage [3], [5].
Irreversible electroporation (IRE) ablation uses a series of
brief (∼100 μs) but intense (1–3 kV) electric pulses delivered to
a targeted tissue volume via needle electrodes [6], [7], altering
the resting cell transmembrane potentials to create irrecoverable nanoscale defects [8]. IRE ablation is unaffected by blood
perfusion thermal sinks and does not affect acellular tissue constituents, preserving patency of the major vasculature, ductal
systems, and other sensitive structures [9], [10]. Treatments are
controlled by electrode placement and pulse parameters, and
can be monitored in real time [11]–[13]. Clinical trials are evaluating IRE safety and efficacy in organs including kidney, liver,
lung, prostate, and pancreas [14]–[20].
To ensure complete tumor destruction while sparing remaining healthy tissue, IRE protocols require accurate predictive
treatment planning models. IRE effects change with clinical indication and organ [20], likely due changes in cell and tissue
composition. Preclinical renal IRE demonstrates sparing of collecting system, renal calices, medulla pelvis, and vasculature
within ablated regions [21]–[24]. However, characterization of
renal tissue electrical properties and effective lethal IRE electric
field threshold remains to be determined. These differences may
cause discrepancy between simulation predictions and in vivo
ablations [25].
Unique renal anatomy will affect electric field distribution
and cellular sensitivity to the electric pulses. These properties
are also dynamic, as aqueous pathways through cell membranes
from electroporation (EP) dramatically change local tissue electrical conductivity [26], thus altering the electric field and ablation zone [27]–[29]. Ex vivo porcine renal experiments matched
this behavior with an asymmetrical sigmoid function of local
electric field σ(|E|) [30]. Other studies examining dynamic conductivity behavior suggest its prevalence and effect on electric
field distributions. In vivo rat liver experiments showed a 3.8×
increase in conductivity [31]. Several tissues were modeled with
a symmetrical sigmoid conductivity function in [28] and [29].

Calibrated canine brain ablations used a σ(|E|) equation based
on EP and thermal tissue change values in the literature [32].
These dynamic conductivity functions better match experimental electrical currents than static models [33]. However, it remains important to characterize the tissue-specific properties for
these functions and confirm which dynamic conductivity electric field distributions appropriately match lesion shapes under
IRE tissue ablation protocols.

II. METHODS
Here, we expand upon the findings in [34] by comparing numerical simulations using three conductivity functions to represent three unique electrode and voltage strength protocols. In
this study, in vivo canine renal ablations are performed while
pre- and intrapulse electrical current measurements are taken to
determine conductivity parameters. Lesions are correlated with
one static and two dynamic numerical models to determine an
effective electric field threshold, EIRE , for renal tissue using
100 pulses, each 100-μs-long, and delivered at 1 pulse/s.

A. In Vivo Renal Experiments
1) Animal Preparation: IRE ablations were performed in
canine kidneys in a procedure approved by the AMREP Animal Ethics Committee. Four previously condemned male greyhounds weighing approximately 30 kg were procured from
sources approved by the animal ethics committee for use in research. All canines were quarantined ࣙ24 h prior to procedures
for acclimation and to ensure health. Subjects were premedicated with acetylpromazine (0.1 mg/kg), atropine (0.05 mg/kg),
and morphine (0.2 mg/kg) prior to general anesthesia induced
with propofol (6 mg/kg, then 0.5 mg/kg/min) and maintained
with inhaled isofluorane (1–2%). Anesthetic depth was monitored with EEG brain activity bispectral index (Covidien,
Dublin, Ireland). After ensuring adequate anesthesia, a midline
incision was made and mesenchymal tissue was maneuvered to
access the kidney. Immediately prior to pulse delivery, pancuronium (initial 0.2 mg/kg dose, adjusted based on contractions)
was delivered intravenously to mitigate pulse-induced muscle
contraction.
2) Experimental Procedure: Two parallel 18 gauge needle
electrodes (1.0 mm diameter and 1.0 cm in exposure) were inserted as pairs into the superior, middle, or inferior lobe of the
kidney at a separation distance of either 1.0 or 1.5 cm (center-tocenter). A BTX ECM830 pulse generator (Harvard Apparatus,
Cambridge, MA) was used to deliver an initial 100 μs prepulse
of voltage corresponding to a 50 V/cm voltage-to-distance ratio
between the electrodes, with distance being the center-to-center
separation. The prepulse is used to determine baseline electrical
conductivity for the numerical models. Electrical current was
measured with a Tektronix TCP305 current probe connected to
a TCPA300 amplifier (both Tektronix, Beaverton, OR). A Protek
DS0-2090 USB computer-interface oscilloscope provided current measurements on a laptop using the included DSO-2090
software (both GS Instruments, Incheon, Korea). A schematic
of the experimental setup can be found in Fig. 1(a).

Following the prepulse, a series of 100 pulses, each 100 μs
long, at a rate of 1 pulse/s was delivered, reversing polarity after
50 pulses. A 5 s pause was encountered after pulses 10 and
50 to store the data. The three protocol applied voltages and
electrode separation distances (center-to-center) are shown in
Table I. The electric field from needle electrodes has an inhomogeneous, nonlinear distribution, which varies spatially. and is
thus highly spatially variable. Therefore, the voltage-to-distance
ratio is provided as a general reference metric for pulse intensity based on needle separation and voltage. Electrodes were
removed following pulse delivery. Ablations were performed
in the remaining lobes before repeating the procedure on the
contralateral kidney, resulting in a total of three ablations per
kidney and six per canine.
Trials were repeated until satisfying n ࣙ 4 trials per setup and
attaining ablation height and width dimensions with standard
deviations less than 10% of their average for each protocol.
These criteria were considered acceptably reliable data with
the minimum required subject number. Fourteen ablations were
performed in eight kidneys (see Table I).
3) Lesion Determination: Animals were maintained under
anesthesia 6 h following electric pulse delivery, as this has
been noted a sufficient period to allow lesion development in
other tissues [35], [36], before euthanasia via pentobarbital overdose. Kidneys were removed; trial sections were separated and

preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h prior to sectioning into 5 mm slices and photographed. Images were blinded
and analyzed with imageJ (National Institutes for Health, MD)
to determine maximum lesion length and width dimensions [see
Fig. 1(b)], with statistical significance tested via ANOVA using
Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).
4) Histology and Viability Evaluation: Formalin-only preserved samples were sectioned and stained with haemotoxylin
and eosin. Triphenyltetrazoliumchloride (TTC) dye was used in
early trials to examine gross cell viability. In these trials, harvested regions were sectioned into 5 mm slices and immersed in
5% TTC phosphate buffered saline for 20 min prior to moving
to 10% buffered formalin.
B. Numerical Modeling
Numerical models offer a platform for predicting EP effects
by simulating distributions of electrical conductivity, electric
field, and temperature. The electric field distribution combined
with an effective lethal electric field threshold for IRE at a given
set of secondary pulse parameters, EIRE , enables predicting
ablation volumes under different electrode arrangements and
applied voltages. This ability is vital for optimizing treatment
protocols for patient-specific scenarios. While these effects have
been examined in other tissues and cells in suspension [37],
accurate model predictions must be standardized to in vivo data.
Thus, here we examine and calibrate numerical simulations to
enable treatment planning under three experimental protocols
using three tissue electrical conductivity behaviors.
1) Kidney Segmentation and 3-D Reconstruction: The computational model domain was constructed from donated MRI
scans of a similarly sized canine, scaled by 1.21 times to match
the experimental kidneys. Mimics 14.1 image analysis software
(Materialise, Leuven, BG) was used to segment axial kidney
MRI traces, which were integrated into a 3-D kidney volume for
export to 3-matic version 6.1 (Materialise, Leuven, BG) to generate a volumetric mesh compatible with Comsol Multiphysics
finite-element modeling software (Comsol Multiphysics, v.4.2a,
Stockholm, Sweden).
Electrodes were simulated as cylinders, each 1 cm long and
1 mm in diameter, and separated by 1 or 1.5 cm (center-to-center)
to represent the experiments. Pairs were inserted into the 3-D
kidney mesh with tips 1.5 cm deep, thus leaving 5 mm between
the proximal electrode edge and kidney surface. Because the
results of Neal et al. [34] showed negligible effects from the
modeled electrode lobe of insertion (horizontal versus vertical
models), all simulations were performed using the horizontal
electrode insertion, representing placement in the middle lobe.
2) Electric Field Distribution: The electric field distribution
is determined according to
∇ · (σ(|E|)∇φ) = 0

(1)

where σ is the electrical conductivity of the tissue, E is the
electric field in V/m, and φ is the electrical potential. Tissue–
electrode boundaries were defined as φ = Vo or 0. The remaining boundaries were considered electrically insulating,

563

dφ/dn = 0, since the kidneys were isolated from the surrounding mesenchymal tissue during the procedures.
3) Electrical Conductivity Behavior and Functions: The
model was calibrated to the effective renal bulk tissue conductivity and response to the electric pulses, including one with
homogeneous static conductivity (σ0 ), and two dynamic models
that accounted for EP-based conductivity changes. The dynamic
models relate baseline and maximum conductivities in a continuous function based on local electric field exposure that can
be matched to overall bulk tissue properties. The baseline conductivity, σ0 , was determined by matching simulated prepulse
electrical current from the static conductivity model with the
experimental data, where field strength should be below the
EP threshold of cells in the tissue. The maximum conductivity,
σm ax , occurs when the cellular membranes no longer restrict the
extent of interstitial electrolyte mobility. The statistical model
in [38] was used to predict σm ax from previously characterized
tissue prepulse response to σ0 , using parametric analyses of
models and electrical data from other tissues. The σ0 and σm ax
values were determined uniquely for each model conductivity
condition. The conductivity values were calibrated as functions
of the electric field to provide overall bulk tissue effective conductivities that match the measured electrical currents from the
experimental pulse protocols, producing model-specific parameters for the three electrical conductivity conditions.
The σ0 and σm ax values provide the parameters to define
electric field-dependent conductivity, σ(|E|), of renal tissue in
vivo. One model assumed a linear relationship, σL (E), where
σ0 and σm ax were related by a linear relationship over the range
between 200 and 2000 V/cm. The second dynamic conductivity
simulation used electrical conductivity conditions of an asymmetrical sigmoid Gompertz curve σG (E) [30]:
σG (|E|) = σ0 + (σm ax − σ0 ) · exp[−A · exp(−B · E)] (2)
where A and B are unitless coefficients that vary with pulse
length, t (s). This function was fit using curve parameters for a
100 μs long pulse, where A = 3.053 and B = 0.00233 [30].
4) Lethal EIRE Threshold Determination: The finiteelement model simulated the electric field distribution to determine EIRE by correlating numerical results with the in vivo
lesion height and width dimensions. The electric field distribution at the midpoint length of the electrodes determined the
electric field magnitude that matched experimental lesion dimensions. This was performed to determine which model best
matched all three IRE ablation protocols. Tests of statistical
significance between ablation protocols, as well as calibrated
electric field threshold, were calculated with Student’s t-test and
ANOVA using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).

horizontal (middle lobe) and vertical (outer lobes) electrode insertion approaches. Average current from the first ten pulses
for each protocol was used to determine σm ax in the numerical models. There was no statistically significant relationship
between pulse number and current, suggesting that cumulative
temperature rise from the pulses did not contribute to bulk tissue electrical properties for these pulsing protocols, and thus
thermal effects were excluded from the numerical simulations.
2) Lesion Dimensions: Lesions were clearly visible as an
ellipsoidal hemorrhagic region centered between the electrode
placements. The TTC dye trials (not shown) turned viable tissue outside the lesion bright red, which was absent within the
hemorrhagic zone. Lesion size did not correlate with lobe. Lesions were primarily contained within the renal cortex. Previous in vivo porcine renal experiments show that ablation zones
will preferentially be drawn toward the renal medulla [40]. Although some lesion portions from our trials extended in the
depth dimension into the renal medulla, the extent of medulla
interaction did not notably change lesion cross-sectional dimensions. Therefore, model tissue properties did not consider renal
medulla interaction. Statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences in lesion width and area are observed between all setups
[see Table III and Fig. 2], while height was similar for 1 cm
1750 V/cm and 1.5 cm 1500 V/cm.
3) Histology: IRE lesion histology in renal cortex [see
Fig. 3] showed a central zone of complete cellular necrosis

surrounded by a peripheral transition zone, with differential viability based on tissue structure and type, before reaching the
complete ablation boundary. The transition zone showed additional viable structures in cortex tissue with increasing distance
from the electrodes. The first to survive the pulses were arterioles and other vasculature, followed by glomeruli, distal convoluted tubules (DCTs), and finally proximal convoluted tubules
(PCTs). Renal medulla and the collecting system are composed
mainly of vascular bundles and collecting ducts, making them
more homogeneous than cortex. The completely necrotic to
completely unaffected transition was thus much sharper in these
regions than the cortex.
B. Numerical Modeling
1) Kidney Segmentation and 3-D Reconstruction: Fig. 4(a)
shows the canine kidney 3-D MRI volumetric mesh with the
midpoint plane illustrating where electric field distributions
were calibrated. Fig. 4(b)–(d) shows electric field along two
perpendicular lines along the height or width from the center of
the midpoint plane [see Fig. 4(a), red lines], used to calibrate
EIRE . Max electric field difference between the center versus
outer lobe orientation was <10% (not shown), suggesting negligible boundary effects for the orientations here.
2) Determination of Dynamic Conductivity Function: Average prepulse electrical current was used to calibrate baseline
electrical conductivity, σ0 , for all simulations (0.353 S/m) (see
Table IV). The σm ax values for the Gompertz and linear dynamic
conductivity functions were calculated using the procedure outlined in [38], showing average increases of 3.39× (linear) and
2.80× (Gompertz), which is in agreement with other organs
[29]. The remaining simulations for calibration employed the
average σm ax value of each modeling style. The resulting simulated currents for each simulation shows dynamic conductivity
models much better match experimental currents (seeTable V),
consistent with [33]. Maximum electrical current difference between horizontal and vertical electrode insertion models was
3.5% [34], further indicating insignificant boundary effects at
the electrode insertion depths used in this study (0.5 cm to kidney surface).

well as the effect of voltage-to-distance ratio.
The electric field distributions from all three modeling techniques were correlated with the experimental lesion height and

conditions.

and standard deviations for EIRE shows the smallest standard
deviation in the Gompertz model (575 ± 67 V/cm) versus static
(501 ± 121 V/cm) or linear dynamic (638 ± 76 V/cm) models.
The Gompertz dynamic function electric field distribution best
approximates lesion shapes, with average height-to-width aspect ratios (EIRE,H /EIRE,W = X) over the experimental setups
of 1.00 ± 0.12 (mean ± SD). A suitable ratio of 1.04 ± 0.13
was found for the linear dynamic model, but the static model
ratio of lesion shapes was 0.73 ± 0.10, indicating the static
models consistently underestimate electric field height dimensions. Although numerical model calibrations of lesion areas
do not account for shape variability, the corresponding electric field thresholds were 614 ± 54 V/cm for the σG model,
525 ± 53 V/cm for σ0 model, and 680 ± 68 V/cm for the σL
model.
Improved prediction precision is evident from experimental
lesions [see Fig. 6(a), (d), and (g)] superimposed with electric
field isocontours from σ0 and σG (|E|) models [see Fig. 6]. The
σ0 model [see Fig. 6(c), (f), and (i)] required a broader electric
field range to capture lesion shape due to poor height-to-width
electric field distribution shape relative to the σG (|E|) model
[see Fig. 6(b), (e), and (h)].
These results show a model using an asymmetrical sigmoid
dynamic conductivity function, σG , with σ0 = 0.353 S/m and
σm ax = 0.988 S/m offer the best simulation of IRE renal ablations. The σL model also provided good consistency, suggesting
that linear dynamic models are suitable for predicting therapeutic EP volumes. At 100 pulses, each 100 μs long, the ablation
volume corresponds to the σG modeled 575 ± 67 V/cm electric
field using clinically relevant geometries and voltages.

can be seen that the dynamic Gompertz function model has a tighter range and
better general shape to match true experimental in vivo lesions.

IV. DISCUSSION
This study correlates numerical models with in vivo IRE renal ablations to determine the relevant electrical properties and
lethal electric field threshold for the pulsing protocol used. Ex
vivo porcine core samples generated a σG (|E|) function between initial and maximum electrical conductivities [30]. Here,
the improved accuracy of the σG (|E|) function is shown in vivo,
where it generates the best electric field distribution to match
ablations out of the three conductivity styles examined, as indicated by the smaller standard deviations of predicted ablation
shapes. The linear dynamic conductivity model produced nearly
equal quality predictions, and both approaches offer significant
improvement over static conductivity models.
Dynamic conductivity models preferentially expand electric
field in the height dimension. Improving EIRE calibrations to
match true lesion shapes via the EH /EW ratio is critical, as
ablation height and width dimensions are often used as the guiding criterion when determining appropriate electrode placement
arrays for complete targeted volume coverage. Lesion depth
is controllable by changing exposure lengths or utilizing the
pulse-withdraw-pulse technique. Calibrating lesions to overall ablation volumes or cross-sectional areas is inappropriate
for determining optimal modeling techniques, as they offer no
shape characteristics. Following confirmation of an appropriate
modeling technique, additional ablation metrics such as area
and volume can refine EIRE accuracy.
Lesion growth and resolution is a complex process that may
evolve over days to weeks, with the time of maximum dimensions difficult to determine, and possibly varying with tissue

NEAL, II, et al.: IN VIVO IRREVERSIBLE ELECTROPORATION KIDNEY ABLATION: EXPERIMENTALLY CORRELATED NUMERICAL MODELS

conditions such as tissue type, vascularity, and immunological
status. Therefore, the 6 h post-IRE period for lesion development was selected to capture clearly delineated lesions, shown
by 2 h post-IRE, with additional development and apoptosis
markers found by 6 h [35], [36]. Adjuvant apoptotic, immunological, and ischemic reactive components may contribute to
larger ablation volumes over several days to weeks post-IRE
[11], [41], which would lower calibrated absolute EIRE , but the
extent of which remains to be defined and is a topic of further
inquiry for ongoing studies.
Although strong radiologic-pathologic correlation has been
shown at 2 h post-IRE [35], pathologically confirmed lesions
were used in this study to calibrate the numerical simulations
rather than imaging. This was due to the complex and dynamic
response of tissue to IRE, including edema and vascular occlusion, which can complicate viability examination at the 6 h for
lesion evolution here. It should be noted that formalin fixation
prior to histologically confirming ablated regions will shrink
the sectioned tissues, and thus the measured lesions, increasing calibrated EIRE . This may be responsible for the smaller
histological ablations versus numerical predictions in [25], as
well as CT results at 0 and 1 day post-IRE. Future treatments
may reduce this effect by using rapid frozen tissue samples to
determine cellular effects for lesion evaluation, although the
improved lesion shape matching of the dynamic conductivity
models should persist in any context.
Valuable examination into the ability for existing treatment
plan algorithms to predict ablation outcomes in porcine renal
tissue was made in [25]. Static conductivity models simulated
six experimental IRE protocols using previously calibrated liver
EIRE thresholds, which seem to best match the 24 h post-IRE
CT scans of the central nonenhancing core. This region is described to likely indicate the region of complete ablation rather
than the hyperemic rim, which may match the pathological transition zone, and was considerably larger than predictions. All
ablation examinations were larger than the histologically confirmed sections, possibly from formalin-induced tissue contraction. Their study offers valuable experimental data to attain
additional insight when comparing numerical simulations with
in vivo ablations. This includes evaluation using dynamic conductivity models. Additionally, new kidney-specific numerical
model calibrations may further improve modeling predictive capacity of their ablations. Finally, where our study examines a
single set of secondary pulse parameters (100 μs, 100 pulses) to
standardize an effective EIRE for these specific conditions, their
study used several secondary pulse parameters, thus further examination with newly calibrated thresholds would offer insight
for how these parameters influence effective EIRE thresholds.
While it is established that temperature changes will affect tissue electrical conductivity [42], [43], their effects were excluded
from the numerical models. This is because the electric current
measurements showed no notable relationship between current
and pulse number, where higher pulse numbers would reflect
cumulative temperature rise. Although the results are consistent
with the in vivo findings in [40], the absence of current rise with
pulse number is contrary to the findings in [30], where a correlation could be attributed to the predicted rise of 1–3%·°C−1 from

567

the literature [42]. The study in [30] used ex vivo core samples
homogeneously exposed to electric fields via plate electrodes,
without heat conduction to surrounding tissues or blood perfusion heat sink, contrasting with the in vivo trials here. Thermal
effects exude less influence on tissue conductivity and electric
field redistribution than EP [41], with little effect on EIRE . Future work may consider thermal effects by adding a temperature
term to the dynamic electrical conductivity function [32].
The Gompertz conductivity function produced electric fields
that best matched the in vivo lesion shapes, determined by
EH /EW ratios. The linear dynamic conductivity function was
equivalent within statistical significance. Previous literature
shows dynamic conductivity equations, including step, linear,
sigmoid, and exponential functions, improve electric current
and affected volume size predictions [28], [29], [33], [37],
[44]. Model EIRE standard deviations here were primarily attributable to experimental variability.
This study used three electrode geometry and voltage combinations to derive renal tissue electrical properties and EIRE .
This permits treatment planning under varying electrode geometries and voltages, such as those described theoretically in [45]–
[47], enabling patient-specific simulations to plan treatments.
Secondary pulse parameters (pulse length, repetition rate, and
number of pulses) will alter susceptibility to IRE and cumulative conductivity behavior of the tissue, as shown in vitro [48]
and in vivo [41]. Therefore, the EIRE determined here will vary
if these parameters are significantly changed from the 100 μs,
100 pulses at 1 pulse/s, which is within typical clinical and
experimental ranges [49].
Although electrical parameters may vary for other tissues, this
study supports using dynamic conductivity simulations, particularly an asymmetrical sigmoid function, to provide accurate
lesion dimension approximations. While explicitly determining
relevant conductivity parameters for each tissue for IRE remains
important, the β-dispersion hypothesis in [30] may approximate
necessary parameters in the absence of in vivo data. This hypothesis predicts conductivity parameters by relating saturated
EP tissue response with tissue behavior in the MHz AC frequency range, which also negates cell membrane influence on
tissue conductivity.
Histology offers interesting considerations here. IRE is noted
to produce sharp delineations between dead and unaffected cells
in healthy liver [6], a relatively isotropic and homogeneous
organ. However, a 1–3 mm transition zone is noted beyond the
wholly necrotic region for renal cortex cells, which appears
dependent on the cell and microstructure. Progressively further
from the electrodes, the first surviving structures were blood
vessels and glomeruli, followed by DCTs, and finally PCTs.
This observation is consistent with the findings in porcine renal
ablations [25].
Transition zone structure viability correlation with electric
field suggests possible EIRE cell dependence and the potential
influence of secondary cell death mechanisms, including ischemia and apoptosis. Higher PCT energy demands compared
to other renal structures may make them less resilient to pulsemediated vascular occlusion ischemia or membrane integrityinduced stresses. Because rapidly dividing cancer cells typically

568

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2015

have high energy demands, it is possible they may be killed at
lower pulse protocol strengths than healthy, fully differentiated
cells more tolerant of EP-induced stresses. This prospect remains speculative, but supports findings in [50], where IRE
killed sarcoma cells while adjacent muscle cells survived. The
relatively homogeneous distribution of cellular constituents in
renal medulla affected from our trials did not exhibit this transition zone.
This work used healthy renal tissue to derive EIRE and validate dynamic conductivity modeling techniques. Further in vivo
work should determine IRE efficacy and tissue properties in renal tumors. The results may be combined to optimize treatment
plans that can ensure complete destruction of the tumorous tissue while understanding the extent of damage to healthy tissue.
Such further refined simulations may also account for other localized tissue heterogeneities such as the distribution of major
vasculature or the collecting system.
Short to medium-term preclinical studies investigating
macro- and microscopic effects of IRE in healthy renal tissue show complete cell death of glomerular and tubule cortex structures while sparing major vasculature. Initial heterogeneous urothelium effects were noted, but did not damage the
urinary system 28 days post-IRE due to regeneration of the
urinary system and preservation of urothelial basement membranes, with no urinoma evidence [21], [22]. Renal lesions 24
and 36 h post-IRE showed a transition zone between necrotic
and normal tissue with evidence of tubule degeneration and
complete cell necrosis beyond lesions [51]. Two to four week ablations became contracted scars, with cortex structures replaced
by fibrous tissue. There was evidence within ablations of morphologically viable and regenerating tubules, as well as intact
ECM and regenerative pelvic epithelium. Urinary tract effects
showed protection of the urine-collecting system with regenerated urothelial tissue [24]. In addition, angiographic contrast
evaluation on ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys showed no acute
collateral vascular damage [23]. Early clinical investigations
demonstrate the safety profile of IRE renal ablation performed
immediately prior to resection [52], and have reported promising early therapeutic potential for IRE as a stand-alone modality
for renal tumor treatment [14].
V. CONCLUSION
This study performed in vivo IRE renal ablations to calibrate numerical modeling techniques employing three distinct
electrical conductivity conditions. Varying electrode geometry
and pulse parameters demonstrate the ability to customize ablation regions for a given pulse protocol. Histology showed a
fully necrotic ablation zone within a peripheral transition zone,
demonstrating heterogeneous lethality dependent on structural,
tissue, and cell variety. Computational models simulating the
experiments determined in vivo renal electrical properties for
EP-based treatment planning to determine a kidney-specific effective lethal electric field threshold. An asymmetrical sigmoid
dynamic electrical conductivity function provided more accurate and precise predictions of electrical currents and experimental lesion shape than static models, with linear dynamic models
nearly equally suitable. These dynamic conductivity functions

and the lethal electric field threshold may be used in numerical models to aid renal IRE treatment plans and predict healthy
renal parenchyma damage for a protocol employing similar parameters to the 100 pulses, 100 μs long pulses used in our in
vivo procedures.
