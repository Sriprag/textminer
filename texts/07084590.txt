SimConcept: A Hybrid Approach for Simplifying
Composite Named Entities in Biomedical Text
Chih-Hsuan Wei, Robert Leaman, and Zhiyong Lu

Abstract—One particular challenge in biomedical named entity
recognition (NER) and normalization is the identification and
resolution of composite named entities, where a single span refers
to more than one concept (e.g., BRCA1/2). Previous NER and
normalization studies have either ignored composite mentions,
used simple ad hoc rules, or only handled coordination ellipsis,
making a robust approach for handling multitype composite
mentions greatly needed. To this end, we propose a hybrid method
integrating a machine-learning model with a pattern identification
strategy to identify the individual components of each composite
mention. Our method, which we have named SimConcept, is the
first to systematically handle many types of composite mentions.
The technique achieves high performance in identifying and
resolving composite mentions for three key biological entities:
genes (90.42% in F-measure), diseases (86.47% in F-measure),
and chemicals (86.05% in F-measure). Furthermore, our results
show that using our SimConcept method can subsequently
improve the performance of gene and disease concept recognition and normalization. SimConcept is available for download at:

I. INTRODUCTION
N biomedical text mining, many studies have focused on automatically extracting relevant information from published
literature. The relevant information is commonly focused on
a specific topic, such as protein–protein interactions [2], [3],
protein transport and localization [4]–[6], drug-disease associations [7]–[9], or gene function extraction [10]. Most of the
common retrieval methods apply natural language processing
or machine learning to identify relations in text. One crucial
step toward this goal is automatically recognizing bioconcept
mentions (e.g., gene/protein)—the task of named entity recognition (NER)—and mapping the bioconcept to a specific database
identifier (e.g., NCBI EntrezGene)—the task of normalization.
Many international biomedical text mining competitions (e.g.,
BioCreative) have, therefore, focused on these tasks [11]–[13].
Genes, diseases, and chemicals are particularly notable for not
only being important concepts, but also being the most popular

concepts in biomedical literature search [14], [15]. Most normalization studies face two challenges: term variation and ambiguity [16]–[22]. Many previous studies have defined individual
strategies (e.g., machine learning, statistical inference, and rulebased methods) to deal with these two issues. However, a particular type of error that has not been handled well is composite
mentions, where a single span refers to more than one concept
(e.g., “SMADs 1, 5, and 8”). Such mentions specifically refer
to multiple concepts; they are, thus, distinct from phenomena
such as protein complexes and chemical mixtures where multiple entities combine to form a single physical unit. We observe
that in our datasets, approximately 10% of gene, disease, and
chemical mentions are composite mentions, hence, it is important to handle them properly. This study presents a new method
for bioconcept mention simplification in a systematic fashion.
Most related previous studies have focused on text simplification (including both document/paragraph [23]–[27] and sentence [28]–[31] levels). The few studies that have considered
mention simplification have only addressed coordination ellipsis. Buyko et al., [32] developed a CRF-based method with
three states: conjunction, conjuncts, and ellipsis antecedent. For
example, in “human and mouse cells,” “human” and “mouse”
are conjuncts, “and” is a conjunction, and “cells” is an ellipsis
antecedent. They evaluated their method using the GENIA [33]
corpus, obtaining 86% accuracy. Due to the lower performance
of this method on complex ellipsis (e.g., “recombinant human
nm23-H1, -H2, mouse nm23-M1, and -M2”), Chae et al., [34]
developed a pattern-based method, using lexicons to identify
the region of each component (i.e., conjunction, conjuncts, and
ellipsis antecedent) for each mention. However, these previous
studies have focused on only one type of composite mention:
mentions with coordination ellipsis.
In this study, a total of six types of composite mentions are
considered including five distinct types (including abbreviation
pair) and a mixed type of mentions.
1) Mention with coordination ellipsis: the concepts in this
type of mentions share part of the mention region, such as
the token “SMAD” in “SMADs 1, 5, and 8.”
2) Range mention: Like mentions with coordination ellipsis,
these mentions share part of the mention region, however,
this type represents a range of entities rather than a discrete
set (e.g., “SMAD 2 to 4”).
3) Individual mention: this is an independent composite
mention. All concepts can be separated into nonoverlapping spans (e.g., “BTK/ITK/TEC/TXK”).
4) Overlap abbreviation pair mention: The long form and
short form share some tokens, like “COUP (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter) transcription factor” where the
phrase “transcription factor” is shared across “COUP tran-

mentions (I); Redundant (O). The states “C,” “CR , ” “L,” “R,”
“Ro ” (L and R/Ro occur in pairs), and “I” are conjunction states
that can use to recognize the mention types. If one mention includes two or more conjunction states, this mention would be
identified as a mixed mention.
Our implementation uses a linear chain CRF [35] provided by CRF++ (http://crfpp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/
index.html). CRF++ applies L-BFGS [36], which is a quasiNewton algorithm for large scale numeric optimization problems.

scription factor” and “chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor.” But the two concepts indicate
the same database identifier.
5) Individual abbreviation pair mention: this is an independent composite mention where the two individual concepts indicate the same database identifier (e.g., “ectodermal dysplasia”).
6) Mixed mention: It is a mixed mention of any two above
types, like “high mobility group protein 1 and 2”—a mix
of type 1 and 4.
The three main contributions of this study are: 1) a new tool
called SimConcept was developed to handle six types of composite mentions, more than any other methods previously reported; 2) when applied to the three bioconcepts (i.e., gene,
disease, and chemical), our method achieved state-of-the-art
performance; and 3) based on our success on more than one entity type, our approach is shown to be robust and generalizable.
II. METHODS
Overall, our method consists of two modules as shown in
Fig. 1. The first module consists of a conditional random field
(CRF) model. In this module, the input mention is separated
into tokens and each token assigned labels according to the
most likely sequence of states through the model. The second
module reassembles the tokens into individual mentions using
a pattern identification method.
A. CRF Model
As mentioned earlier, we regarded this mention simplification
problem as a sequence-labeling task. To recognize the composite
mentions, we observed the composition of those mentions and
defined nine states for building a CRF model [35]: antecedent
(A); strain/suffix(S); conjunction of mentions with coordination
ellipsis (C); conjunction of range mentions (CR ); left parentheses of abbreviation pair (L); right parentheses of abbreviation
(R); right parentheses of abbreviation, but the abbreviation and
long form cannot be separated (Ro ); conjunction of individual

We used tmVar’s tokenization [37] and part of its features in
SimConcept development. Like tmVar, our tokenization separates uppercase characters, lowercase characters, and digits. For
example, “SMADs 2 to 4” is separated to “SMAD,” “s,” “2,” “to”
and “4.” We adapted tmVar’s features to reflect the difference
in input between tmVar (i.e., documents) and SimConcept (i.e.,
individual mentions). After reviewing the evidence for different
token types of a mention, we defined several suffixes, prefixes,
and some semantic types for identifying bioconcepts (i.e., gene,
disease, and chemical) mention characteristics. In particular,
most mention suffixes for disease and chemical mentions are not
digits, for example, “breast and ovarian cancer” (disease) and “bsitosteryl and stigmasteryl linoleates” (chemical), which might
be difficult to recognize without semantic evidence. Therefore,
we collected the semantic features used in some previous studies [37]–[39] and grouped the suffixes/prefixes we defined into
semantic feature types such as those shown as follows.
1) Chemical Suffix: yl, ylidyne, oyl, sulfony, one, and etc.
2) Chemical Alkane Stem: meth, eth, prop, tetracos.
3) Chemical Trivial Ring: benzene, pyridine, toluene.
4) Chemical Simple Multiplier: di, tri, tetra, and etc.
5) Chemical elements: hydrogen, helium, lithium, carbon,
and etc.
6) Disease Suffix: cancer, disease, symptom, and etc.
7) Gene/Protein Suffix: gene, protein, receptor, unit and etc.
8) Family, Complex : family, subfamily, superfamily, complex.
We also continue to use three of tmVar’s features types (i.e.,
character features, case pattern features, and contextual features). Character features include number of digits, number of
uppercase and lowercase letters, number of all characters, and
specific characters (;,. – > + _ / ?). Case pattern features are
created by replacing uppercase alphabetic character to “A” and
any lower case to “a.” Likewise any number (0–9) is replaced by
“0.” Moreover, we also merged consecutive letters and numbers
to generate additional features, such as “AAA” to “A.” Next, we
used evidence in full text as a feature. That is, we would search
candidate mentions in full text and look for their presence. For
example, in determining how to decompose “W1 and W2 W3,”
we would search the bigram “W1 W3” in full text. If found, it is
reasonable to infer that “W1 W3” is a valid and meaningful mention (e.g., ovarian and breast cancer). Otherwise, it is more likely
that W1 should be separated by itself (e.g., emphysema and
liver disease). Finally, in order to take advantage of contextual

but not both locations (i.e., component a and d may not appear together in one mention).

information, for a given token we included the token and semantic features of three neighboring tokens from each side.
C. Token Reassembly Through Pattern Identification
By observing the characteristics of composite mentions in
our training data, we manually defined four patterns to model
the six types of composite bioconcept mentions, as shown in
Fig. 2. To simplify mentions, we distinguish between the antecedent region (green), conjuncts region (frame), conjunct candidate (blue), and conjunctions (red). The tokens in antecedent
region should be present in all possible mentions. The tokens
in conjuncts region should be replaced by all possible conjunct
candidates in this region. Every conjuncts region consists of at
least one conjunction. Conjunctions are used to separate individual conjunct candidates. In our definition, every mention can
map to one of the patterns. Range mentions and mentions with
coordination ellipsis map to Pattern 1. As shown in Fig. 3(a),
the “ORP-2 to -4” is a range mention that can be separated to
“ORP-” (antecedent region), and “2 to 4” (conjuncts region). In
conjuncts region, all possible candidates (i.e., 2, 3, and 4 in “2 to
4”) belong to one of the possible mentions. Therefore, “ORP-2
to -4” is reassembled to “ORP-2,” “ORP-3,” and “ORP-4.” In
another similar case, the “ORP-1 and -2” is similar to “ORP-2
to -4”. The major difference is the conjunction (i.e., “and”). In
this case, “-1” and “-2” in conjuncts region are independent.
Therefore “ORP-1 and -2” becomes “ORP-1” and “ORP-2.”
Observing these two cases, it becomes clear that the difference
between range mentions and mentions with coordination ellipsis
is the conjunctions. In case, the conjunction is recognized as
a conjunction of range mentions (CR state), all values in the
range of these two suffixes should be considered as conjunct

candidates. Otherwise, once the conjunction is recognized as
a conjunction of mentions with coordination ellipsis (C state),
the candidates in the conjuncts region are independent to each
other, and dependent to the antecedent region. Therefore, the
reassembly mentions are the combinations of antecedent region
and each conjunct candidate.
As shown in Fig. 3(b), individual and overlap abbreviation pair mentions belong to Pattern 2. The pair (long form
“neurokinin-3” and abbreviation “NK-3”) of abbreviation mentions is in the conjuncts region. Therefore, the two candidates,
long form and abbreviation, are reassembled with antecedent
region individually. We detected the long form region by applying the Ab3P abbreviation identification tool [40]. Thus, we
are able to identify the conjuncts region in these mentions. Patterns 3 and 4 in Fig. 2 are relatively easier than Pattern 1 and 2.
Since the patterns do not contain a conjuncts region, assembling
the individual mentions only requires splitting conjunctions and
parentheses. As shown in Fig. 3(c)/(d), the mentions can be
separated individually.
In addition to the aforementioned types, mixed mentions are
more complicated. We defined a two-phase strategy to divide
concepts in mixed mentions. In the first phase, we split the mention using Patterns 3 or 4, which do not contain any conjuncts region. In this phase, all conjunctions of range (CR ), mention with
coordination ellipsis (C) and abbreviation parentheses (L/Ro )
are considered as part of antecedent region. In the second phase,
the mention is decomposed by Pattern 1 or 2. In this phase, we
start to face the conjuncts region. As shown in Fig. 4, “interferon
gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible protein 10 (gamma IP-10)” is
split to “interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible protein 10”
and “gamma IP-10” by cutting in first phase. According the
states L/Ro , which have been identified in “interferon gamma

(IFN-gamma)-inducible protein 10,” the second phase should
choose Patten 2 for simplifying. We, therefore, obtained “interferon gamma-inducible protein 10” and “IFN-gamma-inducible
protein 10” from the second phase simplification.
In other words, the main idea of this two-phase strategy is
to retain all submentions with a conjuncts region in the second
phase. Since the submentions that map to Patterns 1 & 2 are
more complicated and cannot be separated individually, those
submentions will be processed in the second step.
D. Postprocessing
To optimize the CRF result in SimConcept, we developed several heuristic rules in postprocessing. The first rule is concerned
with some plural mentions, such as “SMADs 1 and 3.” Typically, we remove the letter “s” from individual mentions when
extracting them from the composite mention. For example, the
output of “SMADs 1 and 3” becomes “SMAD 1” and “SMAD
3.” However, in some cases, the letter “s” is actually part of an

entity name in individual mentions (e.g., “Vps 35”). Therefore,
we first extract individual mentions without the letter “s” and
search for its occurrence in the full text. If we cannot locate it
in full text, we will add the “s” suffix to the individual mention.
The second postprocessing rule handles some antecedent and
prefix tokens that cannot be normally split by our tokenization
module, such as “tri- and diorganton.” In such a case, we recognize the prefix (i.e., tri-, di-, mono-, hexachloro-, hexabromo-,
and hexa-) and change the state of tokens accordingly (e.g.,
diorganton
organton
to di
). As a result, “tri- and diorganton” is
A

decomposed to “triorganton” and “diorganton.”
E. SimConcept Corpus
The SimConcept corpus was compiled using five datasets:
three for genes, one for diseases, and one for chemicals. For
genes, we integrated the BioCreative II gene normalization
task training (281 abstracts) and test (262 abstracts) corpora
and the 151 GIA test collection (http://ii.nlm.nih.gov/DataSets/

To evaluate our method, we used leave-one-out cross validation on the three sets (i.e., gene, disease, and chemical). Table II
shows the results of our evaluation, where we see that the overall
performance is high for all three entity types.
The chemical corpus includes a type of mentions, which is
not addressed by our patterns. It is a joint mention that the
second mention uses coreference to indicate the previous mention, such as “3–0-propargylated betulinic acid and its 1,2,3triazoles.” The pronoun “its” represents the previous mention
“3–0-propargylated betulinic acid.” Therefore, this composite
mention contains two individual mentions “3–0-propargylated

IV CHEMDNER task [42] training dataset for 937 abstracts.
As shown in Table I, we collected 2 424 abstracts in total.
For each article, in addition to the annotations of all described
bioconcept mentions, we appended following annotations: 1)
the decomposed mentions, such as “BRCA1” and “BRCA2”
for “BRCA1/2”; 2) the five types of composite mentions (e.g.,
“mention with coordination ellipsis”); and 3) the states of tokens
1 / 2
(“ BRCA

five composite mention types (CR : Range mention, C: mention
of coordination ellipsis, I: individual mentions, IA: individual
abbreviation, and OA: overlap abbreviation.) in Table I are different between the three sets. Chemicals contain significantly
more range mentions than either disease or genes, and diseases
contain more individual abbreviations than chemicals or genes.
The distribution for genes is more even across all types than
either diseases or chemicals.

betulinic acid” and “1,2,3-triazoles of 3–0-propargylated betulinic acid.” We have ignored this type of mentions.
To assess the performance on each composite mention type,
we computed results shown in Table III. There are only two
range mentions in the disease set, and we therefore, ignored
these. There are also no overlap mentions in the chemical set.
Since two exception mentions belong to continuous mention
type in chemical corpus, the performance of continuous mention
becomes lower.
As mentioned in introduction, this study is aimed at helping
bioconcept normalization. We, therefore, applied SimConcept
in GenNorm [19] and DNorm [16], and evaluated on the test
sets of BioCreative II gene normalization task [45] and NCBI
disease corpus [46], respectively (no normalized chemical corpus is available). To avoid training on the test set, the training
set for SimConcept excluded the test corpora for GenNorm and
DNorm. As shown in Tables IV and V, using SimConcept can
further improve the state-of-the-art performance for 1.17% in Fmeasure (P-value = 0.02) for gene normalization and 1.34% in
F-measure (P-value = 0.03) for disease normalization. We also
applied the heuristic rules used in previous gene normalization
studies [47, 48] and showed the result in second row of Table IV. Our set of heuristics includes nine rules. Those rules are
defined by regular expressions to recognize the conjuncts at the
end of the mention (e.g., detecting “1” and “2” in “BRCA1/2”)
and handle some mentions containing coordination ellipsis and
ranges. However, the composite mentions that are not considered in the refinement of heuristic rules cannot be recognized.
This comparison shows that using heuristic rules is not as robust

as SimConcept. As also shown in Table V, using heuristic rules
raises performance about half as much as SimConcept.
In order to examine the contribution of individual feature
types, we performed a feature ablation study where different
feature types were removed from the entire set of features one
at a time. As shown in Table VI, the largest drop in performance
was due to the removal of token features, followed by semantic
and character features. The removal of case pattern or contextual
features had little effect on final performance. In addition to
removing features, we also changed the order of CRF model
from order 2 to order 1. The result shows order 2 performs
better than order 1.
Despite our best efforts, there are still errors in our decomposition results. We examined a sample set of errors and grouped
them into two major categories. The first group is due to incorrect conjunction type detection. For example, “AKR1C1AKR1C4” is a range mention including AKR1C1, AKR1C2,
AKR1C3, and AKR1C4. However, SimConcept incorrectly recognizes this as a mention with coordination ellipsis, thus missing
two individual mentions AKR1C2 and AKR1C3. This category
accounts for 84% of all errors in SimConcept. The second category is because of the incorrect antecedent/conjuncts region
detection. Approximately 12% of SimConcept errors belong to
this second group. For example, “cytosolic and mitochondrial
serine hydroxymethyltransferase” is a composite mention with
coordination ellipsis, which should be decomposed into “cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase” and “mitochondrial serine
hydroxymethyltransferase.” However, SimConcept recognizes
serine as part of the conjuncts region of “mitochondrial serine”
by mistake. As a result, the output of first extracted mention
becomes “cytosolic hydroxymethyltransferase.”

IV. CONCLUSION
In this study, we present SimConcept—a method to handle the
task of composite named entity simplification. We integrated a
CRF-based method with a pattern identification strategy to systematically decompose the six types of composite mentions.
To handle the three most fundamental bioconcepts, we reannotated the composite mentions in five existing corpora for gene
(BioCreative 2 GN task train/test corpus and NLM GIA corpus), disease (NCBI disease corpus), and chemicals (BioCreative IV ChemDNER task corpus), and used these to evaluate
SimConcept. The results show that SimConcept handles composite mention simplification effectively.

We further used SimConcept to assist the bioconcept normalization task. The results suggest that SimConcept is helpful
for improving normalization performance. Our approach should
generalize to other entity types in addition to the three concepts
that were the focus of this study: genes, diseases, and chemicals. However, the problems of token reassembly step of different concepts are highly diverse. Using a pattern-based method,
may not be able to address all issues. In our future work, we
will apply statistical methods (e.g., an unsupervised statistical
approach [49]) to handle the reassembly issue.
