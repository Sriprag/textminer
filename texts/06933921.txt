A Novel Method to Decrease Electric Field and SAR
Using an External High Dielectric Sleeve at 3 T Head
MRI: Numerical and Experimental Results
Bu S. Park∗ , Sunder S. Rajan, Joshua W. Guag, and Leonardo M. Angelone

Abstract—Materials with high dielectric constant (HDC) have
been used in high field MRI to decrease specific absorption rate
(SAR), increase magnetic field intensity, and increase signal-tonoise ratio. In previous studies, the HDC materials were placed inside the RF coil decreasing the space available. This study describes
an alternative approach that considers an HDC-based sleeve placed
outside the RF coil. The effects of an HDC on the electromagnetic
(EM) field were studied using numerical simulations with a coil
unloaded and loaded with a human head model. In addition, experimental EM measurements at 128 MHz were performed inside
a custom-made head coil, fitted with a distilled water sleeve. The
numerical simulations showed up to 40% decrease in maximum
10 g-avg. SAR on the surface of the head model with an HDC material of barium titanate. Experimental measurements also showed
up to 20% decrease of maximum electric field using an HDC material of distilled water. The proposed method can be incorporated
in the design of high field transmit RF coils.
Index Terms—Barium titanate, birdcage coil, coil design, distilled water, finite-difference time domain (FDTD), specific absorption rate (SAR).

I. INTRODUCTION
AGNETIC resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used in
scientific research and clinical diagnosis because of versatile soft tissue contrast, and the absence of reported harmful
effects in clinical practice. However, high field (> 3 T) MRI is
typically characterized by an increased inhomogeneity of radio
frequency (RF) magnetic field (B1 field) and potential safety
concerns related to increased RF energy absorbed by the subject.
The International Electrotechnical Commission [1] has issued
guidelines limiting the specific absorption rate (SAR), which
is the parameter used to characterize the energy absorbed by
the subject during an MRI. Therefore, it is desirable to minimize SAR, with improved B1 field uniformity and increased
SNR in the field of view (FOV). One of the methods proposed

M

to achieve these goals is based on the use of high dielectric
constant (HDC) materials [2]–[13]. Yang et al. recently proposed a method of decreasing RF power required for a given
flip angle resulting in lower SAR, higher SNR, and improved
B1 field uniformity at 3 and 7 T head imaging [2]–[5]. The
method proposed by Yang was based on the use of HDC materials placed between the RF coil and the human model (i.e.,
“coil-to-sample” space). Neufeld et al. [6] proposed a similar
method to improve sensitivity and SNR using an HDC material
located in the coil-to-sample space at 8.4 T. In the study, an
HDC material of deuterium oxide (D2 O), with relative permittivity εr = 78, was used. The study showed an improvement in
the SNR of about 24%, obtained by manipulating the circulation
of electric field within the coil with the HDC material. Other
experimental and numerical studies have been performed for
high field MRI and MR spectroscopy [8] with several different
HDC materials, including distilled water [4], D2 O [6], calcium
titanate (CaTiO3 ) [10] and barium titanate (BaTiO3 ) [2], [7].
The electrical permittivity of these materials ranges between
78 [6] and 515 [7], the latter being much higher compared to
biological tissues. For comparison, the average εr of the brain
at 128 MHz, for example, is approximately 63 [14], [15].
Based on previous research, a novel method is herein introduced to decrease the electric field and SAR by placing an
HDC material outside of the RF coil, rather than within the
coil-to-sample space. Numerical simulations based on the finitedifference time domain (FDTD) algorithm with a human head
model and two different HDC materials of BaTiO3 and distilled
water were performed to demonstrate the shielding effect. This
effect was also experimentally verified by direct measurements
of electric field amplitude using a birdcage RF coil and a distilled
water dielectric sleeve.

The total electric field (E) in a sample loading an RF coil
is composed of conservative electric field (Ec ), caused by the
scalar electric potential (φ) in the coil winding, and magnetically
induced electric field (Ei ). The total electric field can then be
expressed as follows [16], [17]:
E=−

∂A
− ∇φ = Ei + Ec

where A is the vector magnetic potential (Wb/m).
In order to reduce the SAR and increase SNR, the total electric
field needs to be minimized. When an HDC material oriented
along the longitudinal axis of the RF coil is added outside the

coil, an additional electrical potential is generated with opposite
direction of the original one and partially shields the load in
region of interest (ROI) from the Ec . This effect is valid under
the assumption of no significant wavelength effects [18].
The magnetic field generated by an RF coil in the MRI can
be explained using Ampere’s law [3], [4], [7], [10]
∇ × B/μ = Jc + Jd = σE + jωε0 εr E

current, i.e., secondary field source supporting the propagation
of RF electromagnetic
field, μ is the magnetic permeability

(H/m), j = −1, ω is the angular frequency (rad/s), and ε0 =
8.854 × 10−12 F/m is the electrical permittivity in free space.

Additionally, the B+
1 is defined as B1 = (Bx + jBy )/2, where
Bx and By are the complex amplitudes of x- and y-oriented RF
magnetic fields, respectively [19].
Near the RF coil, because of the very high conductivity of the
copper (σ = 5.8 × 107 S/m) used to build the coil, the dominant source of magnetic field is Jc . However, within the human
head the ratio of ||Jc ||/||Jd || is much lower. For example, at
128 MHz, ||Jc ||/||Jd || is around 1.03 because the average εr
of the brain is approximately 63 and the average σ is approximately equal to 0.46 S/m [15]. Thus, inside the human head,
Jd is responsible for about 50% of the total B1 . Conversely,
the presence of an HDC material generates a high value of Jd ;
therefore, the ratio ||Jc ||/||Jd || would be much less than 1 (e.g.,
||Jc ||/||Jd || = 0.31 for BaTiO3 slurry at 128 MHz), and the
dominant component of the total B1 field is Jd . In summary, the
presence of HDC material can lead to high intensity of displacement current near the material resulting in modified magnetic
fields. Therefore, it is possible to manipulate the magnetic field
using an HDC material. The effect of such manipulation with
HDC material is not necessarily an always improved B+

permittivity) should be conducted.
III. METHODS
A. Numerical Simulations
A high-pass (HP) birdcage head coil was modeled using 12
rungs of 300 mm of length and disposed circularly with an
inner diameter (ID) of 290 mm. Two end rings were used with
ID = 290 mm, outer diameter (OD) = 310 mm, and distance
between the rings of 300 mm [17]. A 5 × 5 × 5 mm3 isotropic
resolution was used for the numerical simulations using a human
head model [20], whereas a 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 resolution was used
with an unloaded head coil to match the experimental results.
1) Simulations With a Human Head Model: Two different configurations were evaluated with and without a
cylindrical sleeve of HDC material (ID = 330 mm, length =
300 mm, thickness = 15 mm) with εr = 333 and σ = 0.72
S/m, corresponding to the properties of barium titanate (BaTiO3 )
[7]. A human head model with 18 different tissue types was used
for the study [20]. The segmented MRI images from a male human subject were transformed into a 3-D grid of Yee cell cubes
for use with the FDTD simulation method to calculate B1 and
E field produced by the RF coil [21]. A total of 24 azimuthally
oriented voltage sources located along the end rings were used
for ideal HP birdcage coil excitation. Each voltage source was
fed with a sinusoidal source at 128 MHz, 1-V peak-to-peak amplitude, a 50-Ω resistor in series, and phases such to have an
ideal quadrature excitation [17], [19].
In the numerical simulations, an ROI within the head model
was selected for data analysis. The ROI was centered at
the isocenter of the coil, extended for 33 mm each in both

(black dotted lines in Figs. 2 and 3).
Fig. 1 shows the geometry of the RF coil, HDC material,
head model, and the experimental setup. Five different geometries (inside 5 mm: ID/OD = 260/270 mm; outside 5 mm:
ID/OD = 330/340 mm; outside 10 mm: ID/OD = 330/350
mm; outside 15 mm: ID/OD = 330/360 mm; outside 20 mm:
ID/OD = 330/370 mm) of the HDC material with the same
length along the z-direction were simulated.
2) Simulations With an Unloaded Head Coil: Additional numerical simulations with an unloaded head coil were performed
to validate the results against experimental measurements.
The dimensions of the coil were same as in A.1. Two different
setups were modeled: unloaded coil without HDC, and unloaded
coil with an external sleeve of HDC material (ID = 330 mm,
length = 300 mm, thickness = 40 mm). The HDC material used
for the simulations and the related experimental measurements
was distilled water (σ = 0.0048 S/m, εr = 74 at 128 MHz). A
total of 12 lumped elements were used in each ring. One of
the elements contained a 1-V peak-to-peak voltage source and
a 50-Ω resistor, and all of the others elements included tuning
capacitors such to obtained the same resonant frequency of the
physical coil. The corresponding tuning capacitors values were
7 pF with the HDC material and 15 pF without it.
A cylindrical ROI was selected for data analysis with this set
of numerical simulations, centered at the isocenter of the coil,
300 mm high (along z-direction) and with a diameter of 280 mm
in the xy plane. The same ROI was selected for the experimental
results.

EM simulations were performed using commercially available software (xFDTD, Remcom Inc., State College, PA) and
data analysis was performed in Matlab (The MathWorks Inc.,
Natick, MA). EM simulation results with the head model (A.1)
were normalized to obtain an average |B1 + | = 4 μT at the
ROI, whereas the EM simulations with the unloaded coil (A.2)
were normalized to obtain an average transverse RF magnetic
field ||Bxy || = 4 μT at the ROI, to match the experimental
conditions.
B. Experimental Measurements
All experiments were performed using a custom made 128MHz birdcage head coil with the same size used in the numerical simulations (12 rungs, ID = 290 mm, L = 300 mm), an RF
amplifier (ENI Inc., Richardson, TX, USA), an RF signal generator (Aeroflex Inc., Plainview, NY, USA), an electromagnetic
field robotic measurement system (DASY 5NEO, with the Efield probe ER3DV6 and the H-field probe H3DV7, Schmid and
Partner Engineering AG, Zurich, Switzerland). A hollow cylindrical sleeve compartment (ID/OD = 305/385 mm, L = 300
mm) filled with an HDC material made of distilled water [see
Fig. 1(b)]. The designed head coil was tuned at 128 MHz and
the measurement of S11 was approximately −17 dB at the
frequency. The RF coil was driven in linear mode. The fieldmapping robot allows measurement of the RMS value of the
amplitude of the electric and magnetic field but does not provide information about the phase. Thus, it was not possible to
measure the values of |B1 + |; hence, all experimental results
were normalized to an average ||Bxy || = 4 μT in the ROI.
IV. RESULTS
Figs. 2 and 3 show the simulation results along three selected
planes (see Fig. 2) and one selected axis (see Fig. 3) of |B1 + |
and ||E|| over the human head with and without the cylindrical
15-mm-thick sleeve filled with the HDC of BaTiO3 . Without
HDC material, the |B1 + | was high in the center of the head

with a sleeve of HDC material of BaTiO3 located inside the coil (first row), and

compared with the surface. Conversely, with the HDC material
the |B1 + | near the surface of the head model was increased
by up to 31% (see Fig. 3), resulting in greater homogeneity of
|B1 + | throughout the defined ROI (black dotted lines in Figs.
2 and 3). However, this comes at a cost of lower homogeneity
in the head-foot direction throughout the brain, because of the
significantly decreased |B1 + | and ||E|| near the end-ring region
(see Fig. 2).
Fig. 4 shows the 10 g-avg. SAR obtained [1] with the same
models. With the HDC material, the maximum 10 g-avg. SAR
decreased by approximately 40% (see Fig. 4 and Table I) and the
whole-head-averaged SAR decreased by approximately 26%.
Figs. 5, 6, and 7 present the numerical simulations of ||E||,
|B1 + | and 10 g-avg. SAR, respectively, with different widths

within the ROI was improved up to 27% (outside 10 mm, see

Table II) and the maximum 10 g-avg. SAR decreased up to 40%
(outside 15 mm, see Table II) as the thickness of the material
located outside of the coil increased to 15 mm, compared to
a 120% increase in maximum 10 g-avg. SAR with the HDC
located inside the coil.
Table III shows the effect of a 15-mm-thick HDC material
with an RF shield. An RF shield with ID = 380 mm, with the
HDC material, generated a 9% decrease of peak 10 g-avg. SAR
(i.e., 11 to 10 W/kg). The effect of the shield was higher with
increasing dimensions; specifically, a shield with an ID = 440
mm generated a 33% decrease of peak 10 g-avg. SAR (i.e., 12
to 8 W/kg).

overall 15% decrease (i.e., 311 V/m versus 265 V/m) of averaged ||E|| over the entire ROI. These results were well matched
by the numerical simulations, which showed a 14% decrease
near the end-ring (i.e., 457 V/m versus 394 V/m) and a 13%
decrease of ||E|| averaged over the entire ROI.
V. DISCUSSION
This study extends the concept of EM field manipulation by
means of placing HDC materials outside the RF coil. Compared
to previous study, where HDC materials were proposed in the
coil-to-sample space, this novel application presents several advantages, including: 1) It does not affect the maximum available
sample size, which is limited by the ID of the RF coil, whereas
in previous study [2]–[5] the size of the sample was limited by
the ID of the HDC material. 2) This design allows more flexi-

bility in optimizing the thickness and the position of the HDC
material compared to a coil-to-sample design because usually
much more space is available outside the RF coil rather than
inside.
However, our design also has some limitations such as: 1) it
may require a change of the former design of the RF coil; 2)
compared to the approach using HDC material in the coil-tosample space, a higher amount of HDC material is needed to
get similar effect because of an increased ID of the material.
Foo et al. [22] proposed a method of improving RF magnetic field uniformity using an HDC material located in the
“coil-to-shield” space in an RF resonator, which is similar to
our approach. However, in Foo’s study, a dielectric material
with suitable relative permittivity was used to increase the axial
propagation constant and to decrease the radial one, resulting in
reduced RF field inhomogeneity, but also in increased RF power
and reduced coil sensitivity. For comparison, while our design
also results in improved homogeneity, it allows for decreased
whole head averaged SAR (up to 43% depending on the sleeve
thickness), decreased 10 g-avg. SAR (up to 40% with a 15-mmthick HDC), and increased |B1 + | uniformity in a ROI (about
27% with a 10-mm-thick HDC) for 3 T/128 MHz head MRI.
As shown in Figs. 2–4, the ||E|| and the 10 g-avg. SAR with
the HDC material were smaller over the whole head, and the
||E|| decreased between head and RF coil because of the partial
shielding effect. This effect was confirmed by the experimental validation shown in Fig. 8. A similar study using a highly
conductive material, i.e., copper, was shown recently [18]. The
shielding effect is more obvious near the surface of the model,
where high values of E and 10 g-avg. SAR were observed (see
Figs. 2–5). Specifically, the effect of the HDC material varied
within the head, depending on the specific volume considered.
For example, as shown in Fig. 4 (coronal view, third row) in
the area near the neck of the head model (A), close to the endring of the RF coil, there were high values of 10 g-avg. SAR,
which were reduced with the HDC material by 40% without
significant changes in |B1 + |. In the surface of the model, near
the temporal region (B), there was up to 31% increase of |B1 + |
(see also dashed rectangular region in Figs. 2 and 3) mainly
due to an increased displacement current near the HDC material. This increased |B1 + | generated additional induced electric
field, which resulted in a 10% increase of maximum 10 g-avg.
SAR [16]. Finally, in the volume in the center of the head, near
the deep brain, (C), characterized by small absolute values of
SAR, there was a ∼10% increase in 10 g-avg. SAR. There was
a 31% decrease of E averaged over the entire head and a 45%

decrease of maximum 10 g-avg. SAR with the 15-mm-thick
HDC material of BaTiO3 (see Table I).
Figs. 5 and 6 and Table II show the simulation results comparing the design proposed in previous studies (HDC inside)
[3] and [5] with the design proposed herein (HDC outside the
coil, with thickness ranging from 5 to 20 mm). When the HDC
material was placed outside of the coil, the uniformity of |B1 + |
within the head ROI was improved up to 27% (outside 10 mm)
(see Fig. 6 and Table II), whereas the maximum 10 g-avg. SAR
decreased with increased thickness of the HDC material up to
the value of 15 mm. With further increases of HDC sleeve thickness (i.e., outside 20 mm), the effect on the |B1 + | uniformity
and 10 g-avg. SAR was decreased (see Figs. 6 and 7 and Table II). This was probably due to an increased wavelength effect
that generated additional reflections within the HDC material
(see Figs. 5–7). Another significant finding was that the E between RF coil and the HDC material located inside the RF coil
(red arrows in Fig. 5, sagittal view, first row) was much higher
compared to the E generated when using an HDC material
of 15 mm outside the coil (fourth row). The increased electric
field could be significant particularly when in the presence of
external devices connected to the patient (e.g., leads of physiological monitoring systems) and this may represent another
possible advantage of using the HDC material outside the coil.
Table I shows numerical simulation results using distilled
water (εr = 74) as HDC material. The simulations were verified
experimentally with a matching setup. The choice of distilled
water, rather than BaTiO3 (εr = 333), was due to the lower
cost and much easier availability. Furthermore, the solid type
BaTiO3 of a head coil size is not currently commercialized. The

decreased shielding effect of distilled water, due to the smaller
εr , was partially compensated by increasing the thickness of the
material from 15 to 40 mm.
Fig. 8 shows the results of experiments and corresponding
numerical simulations. The experimental results measured by
a field-mapping robot showed that the ||E|| decreased of about
15% within the ROI and about 20% near the end-ring region, in
good agreement with the corresponding numerical simulations,
showing a 13% and 14% decrease, respectively. As shown in
Fig. 8, there was a discrepancy between experimental and numerical results especially near the coil rungs, due to simplifications of the coil model compared to the physical coil. Such
simplifications include the error margin (∼10%) of the capacitor values, mechanical errors during design of the coil, as well
as possible inaccuracies due to hardware system (i.e., DASY
system and E/H probes, as well as RF amplifier.)
Table III includes simulation data showing how the effect of
an HDC material is influenced by the presence of an RF shield.
When the RF shield was located close to the 15-mm-thick HDC
material, the effect of HDC materials was decreased. This is
probably due to an additional electric potential due to the RF
shield with opposite direction compared to the potential due to
the HDC material. When the RF shield is located near the HDC
material, this effect would be stronger.
The coil used in this study was a transmit coil only and the
effect of the HDC material was evaluated only in terms of SAR
for MR safety. Future studies may include effect of receive coil,
detuning circuits, SNR evaluation, or possible effects of HDC
material as a potential source of Johnson noise.
The values reported in this study are based on the specific
normalization used, i.e., |B1 + | = 4 μT within the ROI for simulations with a human head model. The specific value of SAR
changes depends on the normalization selected: For example,
if the results are normalized with |B1 + | = 4 μT in the central voxel, rather than the ROI, the decrease of peak 10 g-avg.
SAR for the 15-mm-thick HDC sleeve (see Table II) would then
change from 40% to 26%.
The proposed method may also be suitable for higher frequencies (e.g., 298 MHz), where considerable |B1 + | variation
(typically 50–150% of average B1 + ) are reported. However, the
specific results of this study cannot be simply extrapolated to
different frequencies and further analysis should be conducted to
optimize the HDC material, because of modified variable electromagnetic properties, such as increased wavelength effects
resulting increased |B1 + | inhomogeneity and SAR, increased
conductivity and decreased relative permittivity of the HDC
material.

VI. CONCLUSION
The study presents an evaluation of electric field and SAR
in a subject undergoing MRI when an HDC material is located
outside the RF coil. This method allows optimizing the electric
field with respect to the thickness of the material, does not affect
the space for the sample inside the coil, and has high flexibility
of the HDC material optimization. The methods and results
