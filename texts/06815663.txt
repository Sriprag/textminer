On the Effect of Muscular Cocontraction
on the 3-D Human Arm Impedance
Harshil Patel, Gerald O’Neill, and Panagiotis Artemiadis∗

Abstract—Humans have the inherent ability to perform highly
dexterous tasks with their arms, involving maintenance of posture,
movement, and interaction with the environment. The latter requires the human to control the dynamic characteristics of the upper limb musculoskeletal system. These characteristics are quantitatively represented by inertia, damping, and stiffness, which
are measures of mechanical impedance. Many previous studies
have shown that arm posture is a dominant factor in determining the end point impedance on a horizontal plane. This paper
presents the characterization of the end point impedance of the
human arm in 3-D space. Moreover, it models the regulation of
the arm impedance with muscle cocontraction. The characterization is made by route of experimental trials where human subjects
maintained arm posture while their arms were perturbed by a
robot arm. Furthermore, the subjects were asked to control the
level of their arm muscles’ cocontraction, using visual feedback, in
order to investigate the effect of muscle cocontraction on the arm
impedance. The results of this study show an anisotropic increase of
arm stiffness due to muscle cocontraction. These results could improve our understanding of the human arm biomechanics, as well
as provide implications for human motor control—specifically the
control of arm impedance through muscle cocontraction.
Index Terms—Arm impedance, exoskeleton control, muscle
cocontraction.

I. INTRODUCTION
HE wide range of applications involving physical interaction of robots with humans has received increased attention in the last decades. Since the late 1980s, there has been a
substantial amount of interest in measuring human arm 2-D endpoint stiffness characteristics, where the arm is supported and
constrained to movement within a horizontal (transverse) plane.
A perturbation method for measuring hand stiffness was developed by using a manipulandum to displace the subject’s hand
during maintenance of a given posture in [1]. Stiffness values
were represented both numerically and graphically, using ellipses. These showed that the human musculoskeletal system
has spring-like properties that enable posture stabilization and
interaction with the environment.
From a technological point of view, many different apparatuses have been used for identifying dynamic properties of

the human upper limbs, ranging from mechanical linkages that
are aligned with the anatomical joints [2], to manipulanda that
are held by the subject’s end-effector [3]–[5]. The perturbation
method for estimating arm stiffness has been used by many other
studies as well [6]–[9]. In [10] and [11], the perturbation method
was extended to include measurement of other dynamic components: inertia and damping in addition to stiffness. However,
all these studies focus on the identification of the impedance
components in 2-D, which limits the range of application. The
first attempt to characterize arm impedance in 3-D space was
described in [12], while the characterization of arm stiffness
in 3-D space has been also studied in [13]. The effect of arm
posture on the arm stiffness characteristics has been also studied for a single endpoint position, using subject-selected arm
configuration in [14] and [15].
Although most of the past studies have focused on perturbations during maintained hand posture, there are a few studies that focused on the effect of muscle activation on the arm
stiffness [6], [16]–[22]. Two degrees of freedom were usually
investigated, single endpoint positions, involving a small number of muscles. Control of arm stiffness by coactivating muscles
provides the ability to safely interact with the environment for
every-day-life tasks. Therefore, the investigation of the control
principles for the voluntary adjustment of arm stiffness is quite
significant, and so far unexplored. The latter is the rationale of
our study.
In this paper, a systematic method for characterizing human
arm impedance in 3-D space and its regulation through muscle
cocontraction is presented. A seven degrees-of-freedom (DoFs)
robot arm is used to impose motion to, and measure interaction
forces from, a human subject’s arm. The subject’s arm is appropriately coupled to the robot’s end-effector and is perturbed
along the three axes starting from seven different points, each
corresponding to a different arm configuration in 3-D space.
All the perturbations are repeated for four cases, each involving a different level of muscle cocontraction. A simplified linear model for impedance is used to characterize inertia, damping, and stiffness using measured motion and force data for the
four cases of muscle cocontraction. The stiffness characteristics
are described using ellipsoids, and the effect of arm configuration and muscle cocontraction to the stiffness ellipsoids is
investigated.

Fig. 1. (A) Experimental setup: The robot arm is interfaced with the subject’s
forearm through the mechanical coupling attached at the end-effector. Position
tracking sensors are placed adjacent to the robot base and subject’s shoulder
defining two reference systems. EMG electrodes are placed on six muscles of the
shoulder and elbow. Chair straps are not shown in the picture, but they were used
during the experiments. (B) Coupling components at the human side (right) and

and their right arm was coupled to the robot arm via a mechanical
coupling, attached to the end-effector of the robot arm as shown
in Fig. 1(A). The mechanical coupling is designed such that it
allows no axial or rotational movement of the lower arm inside
it, since it is attached to the human forearm close to the wrist
[23]. The coupling ensured that there was no kinematic redundancy in the subject’s arm for any configuration. The coupling
components as well as the way the human is coupled–decoupled
from the robot using the device are shown in Fig. 1(B) and (C),
respectively. Muscle activation was measured through wireless
surface electromyography (EMG) electrodes (Trigno Wireless,
Delsys). Since the focus is arm impedance, and the coupling
is on the forearm, the muscles that contribute to shoulder and
elbow impedance were recorded: anterior deltoid (AD), posterior deltoid (PD), pectoralis major (PM), trapezius (T), biceps
brachii (BB), and triceps longus (TL).
B. Procedure and Tasks
Four subjects, all male ranging in age from 20 to 26 years,
three of them right handed and one left handed, participated in
this experiment. As explained above, the subjects were strapped
onto a seat placed next to the robot arm. Seven different endeffector poses (position and orientation) in the robot workspace
were selected. With the subject strapped in the same position
on the chair and their right hand coupled to the end-effector,
each of these start points S (i) : i = 1, 2, . . . , 7 corresponded to
a specific configuration of the subject’s arm. The seven arm
configurations tested spanned a wide range of arm positions
in 3-D space, as shown in Fig. 2. The robot was controlled to
impose perturbations in 18 different directions in 3-D space.
This was done by controlling the robot to move to 18 equally

Seven configurations of the arm used.

(i)

spaced points Pj , j = 1, . . . , 18 that lie on a sphere with a
center of the corresponding S (i) point, and a radius of 8 mm.
(i)
The motion of the robot from S (i) to each one of the 18 Pj
points lasted 100 ms, and corresponded to the robot-induced
(i)
perturbation to the human arm. Once the robot arrives at Pj ,
it remains stationary for 500 ms and then returns back to S (i) .
After a resting phase of 1 s, the robot is commanded to reach
(i)
the next Pj point, and the procedure is repeated for all the 18
(i)

Pj points. The trajectory of the robot motion along each axis
was designed using a third-order polynomial function. The robot
provided feedback of the joint angles, as well as end-effector
forces at a frequency of 1000 Hz.
Prior to performing the experiment, the subjects were asked
to cocontract their arm muscles to their maximum ability, while
their arm was in one of the seven configurations selected (configuration 5). EMG signals were recorded from the six muscles mentioned above and sampled at a frequency of 1000 Hz.
The signals were then full-wave rectified and low-pass filtered
(second-order Butterworth filter, cut-off frequency of 8 Hz). The
processed signals em , m = 1, . . . , 6 were stored, and the maximum values for each muscle em ,m ax were computed in order to
be used as normalization factors for the experiments. During the
perturbation experiments, the total cocontraction index C was
computed in real time based on the individual muscle normalized activation level with respect to their maximum activation
level em ,m ax . Therefore, the cocontraction index was given by

C = 16 6m =1 e me,mm a x .
The robot-induced perturbation experiments were grouped
into four cases. In each case, the subject was asked to maintain
a certain cocontraction level of his muscles. The robot-induced

2604

perturbations were identical across the four cases. The cocontraction index C was computed in real time based on the muscles’ activation, and was displayed to the subject in the form of a
bar graph, as shown in Fig. 1(D). The visual display was shown
on a monitor placed in front of the subject, and was updated
at a frequency of 1000 Hz. The levels of cocontraction that the
subjects we asked to maintain were 0%, 50%, 75%, and 100%
for the four phases, respectively. For each of the seven arm configurations, the robot perturbation phase was divided into three
sets of six perturbations each, thereby providing enough time
for the subject to relax his muscles and limiting possible muscle
fatigue.

and duration of the perturbations were very small, the model
of the end point impedance can be expressed by the following
equation:
F = IẌ + BẊ + KX

where I, B, and K represent the 3 × 3 arm inertia, damping
and stiffness matrices, respectively. Ẍ, Ẋ, and X are the 3-D
acceleration, velocity, and displacement vectors, respectively,
while F is the 3-D vector of opposing forces. All variables are
expressed with respect to the human-centered reference frame
X, Y, Z. Equation (1) can be rewritten in a parameter identification form as shown below:
F = PY

C. Data Processing
As explained earlier, the goal of the study is to investigate
how arm impedance changes as a function of muscle cocontraction. The arm impedance characteristics—inertia, damping, and
stiffness—are characterized using a linear model describing the
relationship between measured opposing forces and position of
the arm.
During the experiment, the arm is coupled to the end-effector
of the robot arm via the mechanical coupling. The position of the
end point of the arm, a point in the forearm, was defined as the
center point of the cylindrical housing of the mechanical coupling. Since the coupling was attached to the robot arm, the 3-D
position of this point was tracked at each instance through the
robot joint angles after applying the forward kinematic equations of the robot arm. Therefore, all the motion profiles and
end-effector forces were obtained with respect to the robot base
reference system XR , YR , ZR . Using homogeneous transformation between the robot and the robot mounting plate reference
system XB , YB , ZB , the position of the human end-point, and
the interaction forces, were computed with respect to the humancentered reference frame X, Y, Z.
As mentioned earlier, the robot-induced perturbations lasted
for 100 ms. For all cases (0%, 50%, 75%, 100% cocontraction),
we used force and position data collected during those 100 ms
of perturbation in order to estimate the arm impedance. Although the mechanical perturbations might evoke muscle reflex
responses, the characterization of the effect of the latter on the
arm impedance is out of the scope of this paper. In fact, in most
cases of human–environment interaction, where impedance adjustment is necessary, muscle reflexes are going to be present
and affect arm dynamics. Therefore, since a realistic-practical
model of the effect of muscle cocontraction on arm impedance
is the main focus of this study, we decided to include any reflex
responses—and their effects—in our impedance estimates.
D. Impedance Estimation
The force and motion profiles of interest, i.e., during the
100 ms robot-induced perturbations were extracted for processing. The initial values of forces (average values along 30 ms
before the perturbation onset) in all directions were subtracted
from the subsequent force profiles. This ensured that any kind
of sensor offset or gravitational forces due to weight of the arm
did not affect the opposing force measurements. Since length

III. RESULTS
A. Cocontraction Index
Before analyzing the impedance characteristics identified for
the various levels of muscle cocontraction, it is worth investigating the ability of the human subjects to control their muscles’

activation, based on the visual feedback of the cocontraction
index introduced above. Fig. 3 shows the cocontraction index
when the subject was instructed to maintain it at 50%, 75%,
and 100% level, respectively. It can be seen that the subject
was able to maintain the specific level of muscle cocontraction
in each case. These indexes were seen to slightly vary across
the seven configurations indicating that the ability to cocontract
the muscles to the specific level of cocontraction was different
for different arm configurations. However, we chose to define
the cocontraction index with respect to maximum voluntary cocontraction in a single arm configuration. Although we could
use maximum voluntary cocontraction for each configuration
tested, we decided to use only one in order to have a more general idea of the muscle cocontraction level that could generalize
across configurations. This would allow further investigation of
the ability of muscles to cocontract without being limited on the
arm configuration. Configuration 5 was selected because it was
approximately in the mid-range of the 3-D arm workspace we
used.

2 for axes and configurations. The seven different configurations are color coded
on the left.

B. Impedance Matrices
The impedance matrices I, B, and K for each of the arm configurations were identified and separated into the symmetric and
antisymmetric components as described in the previous section.
It was observed that the opposing forces due to inertia I and
damping B were very small compared to the ones due to arm
stiffness, especially in the cases involving muscle cocontraction. For that reason, it is not certain that they were accurately
identified using the least-squares equation. Moreover, we do not
expect the inertia of the arm to vary for different muscle cocontraction levels, and there is no evidence from the literature
that damping would also change with muscle cocontraction, especially given isometric conditions we investigate here [8], [9],
[15]. Therefore, following directions also found in the literature
[1], [7], we decided to analyze the effect of cocontraction only
on arm stiffness.
The diagonal elements of the identified arm stiffness K xx ,
K y y , K z z averaged across all subjects, are listed in Tables I–IV
for the different cocontraction levels 0%, 50%, 75%, and 100%,

respectively. Moreover, the maximum of all off-diagonal elements of the antisymmetric components are also listed. Finally,
the stiffness was represented as an ellipsoid in 3-D space. The
length of each of the primary, secondary, and tertiary axes of
the ellipsoid is also listed in those tables, as K 1 , K 2 , and K 3 ,
respectively. Fig. 4 shows the stiffness ellipsoids, for one of
the subjects, across all seven configurations, for 0% and 100%
muscle cocontraction.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this study, we focused on two main mechanisms that humans use to control arm stiffness: change of arm configuration
and cocontraction of muscles. We tested those mechanisms in

levels, in order to study their effect on arm stiffness. The effect
of muscle cocontraction on the shape and orientation of the stiffness ellipsoid for an indicative case (configuration 1, subject 1)
is shown in Fig. 5.
The results show that there is a statistically significant
(p ≤ 0.05) effect of both the arm configuration and the mus-

cle activation level on arm stiffness (see values in Tables I–IV).
Focusing on arm configuration, the range of stiffness values we
estimated is very close to those reported in the literature for the
2-D case [6]–[9]. Moreover, the antisymmetric components of
the stiffness were observed to be much lower than the symmetric
components (p ≤ 0.05) (compare fourth column of Tables I–IV
with symmetric components), which agrees with the literature

for planar arm configurations [1], indicating conservative force
fields for the human arm in 3-D space.
Of most importance, however, is the relationship between
the stiffness ellipsoids and muscle co-contraction. Fig. 6 shows
how the stiffness ellipsoid axes were changed in length due to
muscle cocontraction for each arm configuration. All results are
reported with respect to the axes of that ellipsoid, in order to
quantify the effect of muscle cocontraction on the relaxed-arm
stiffness characteristics. Absolute values of stiffness increase
are listed in addition to percentages, in order to show that the
structure-eccentricity of the ellipsoids was not changed, even
when muscles were cocontracted at 100%. As it can be seen,
muscle cocontraction did not change the order of the three axes
of the ellipsoids, therefore did not affect the eccentricity of the
original ellipsoid representing the relaxed muscle case. However, the increase of the length of the original axes is anisotropic,
with the muscle cocontraction having the most significant effect
on the secondary and tertiary axes.
Table V shows the rotation of the stiffness ellipsoids due to
muscle cocontraction. More specifically, Table V reports the
angle difference of each of the ellipsoid axes, for the 100%
cocontraction case with respect the 0% case. Δθ1 , Δθ2 , and Δθ3
correspond to the angle difference of the primary, secondary,
and tertiary axes of the ellipsoids, respectively, between the 0%
and 100% cocontraction cases. Reported values are averaged

across subjects. In terms of rotation of the ellipsoids, a 100%
muscle cocontraction rotates the secondary and tertiary axes
by 22.9◦ in average, compared to the 0% cocontraction case,
while for only 7.5◦ in average in the case of the primary axis.
Statistical analysis of all stiffness changes was done, and all
changes (both in magnitude and rotation) were proved to be
statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05).
From the observations above, we can conclude that muscle
cocontraction induces an anisotropic change of the arm stiffness, affecting primarily the secondary and tertiary axes of the
ellipsoids, and not the primary axis. A possible explanation of
this phenomenon is the way individual muscles contribute to the
change of the overall arm stiffness, which is a function of both
the configuration of the arm, as well as the properties of each
muscle independently. A further investigation of the geometry
of the musculoskeletal models, as well as the contribution of
each muscle to the overall arm Cartesian stiffness should be
conducted. However, it is worth noting that the results are very
consistent across subjects (p ≤ 0.05).
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a systematic method for characterizing the human arm impedance in 3-D space and its regulation through
muscle cocontraction is presented. The proposed method is
based on robot-induced perturbations in posture maintenance
scenarios; however, it introduces control of muscle cocontraction level by the human subject, through visual feedback. A
simplified linear model for impedance is used to characterize
arm stiffness using the measured motion and force data for
four cases of muscle cocontraction (0%, 50%, 75%, and 100%).
The stiffness characteristics are described using ellipsoids, and
the effect of arm configuration and muscle cocontraction on the
stiffness ellipsoids is investigated.
The main novelty of this paper is that it succeeds in characterizing human arm impedance in 3-D space, while investigating the control humans have over the arm stiffness using
muscle cocontraction. The method was applied to four human

subjects, across whom the results were very consistent. Based
on the results, we can conclude that muscle cocontraction induces an anisotropic change of the arm stiffness (p ≤ 0.05),
affecting primarily the secondary and tertiary axes of the ellipsoids, and not the primary axis. A definite explanation of this
phenomenon requires further investigation, including a musculoskeletal model of the arm in order to quantify the role of the individual muscles in the overall end-point Cartesian impedance.
This study can potentially provide a plethora of implications
for EMG-based control of robots that physically interact with
humans. More specifically, understanding the voluntary control
of arm impedance in task (i.e., Cartesian) space is beneficial
for a plethora of applications, ranging from powered orthotics
(exoskeletons), to assistive devices and rehabilitation robotics.
