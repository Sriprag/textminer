A Hybrid Approach to Segmentation
of Diseased Lung Lobes
Q. Wei and Y. Hu, Member, IEEE

Abstract—Complete segmentation of diseased lung lobes by automatically identifying fissure surfaces is a nontrivial task, due to
incomplete, disrupted, and deformed fissures. In this paper, we
present a novel algorithm employing a hybrid two-dimensional/
three-dimensional approach for segmenting diseased lung lobes.
Our approach models complete fissure surfaces from partial fissures found in individual computed tomography (CT) images. Evaluated using 24 patients’ lungs with a variety of different diseases,
our algorithm produced root-mean square errors of 2.21 ± 1.21,
2.51 ± 1.36, and 2.38 ± 1.27 mm for segmenting the left oblique
fissure (LOF), right oblique fissure (ROF) and right horizontal
fissure (RHF), respectively. The average accuracies for segmenting the LOF, ROF, and RHF are 86.59%, 84.80%, and 82.62%,
using our ±3-mm percentile measure. These results indicate the
feasibility of developing an automatic algorithm for complete segmentation of diseased lung lobes.
Index Terms—Isotropic computed tomography (CT) images, lobar fissures, lungs, segmentation, texture analysis.

I. INTRODUCTION
OMPUTED tomography (CT) is the most widely used
imaging technology for diagnosing and treating lung diseases, the third leading cause of death in North America [1].
Modern CT scanners produce a stack of about 500 isotropic
images (0.6 mm in thickness) for a complete scan of an average
patient’s lung cavity. Current clinical protocol combines these
500 isotropic images into approximately 60 clinical images, by
merging several isotropic images into a single clinical image.
Reading clinical images results in loss of valuable information,
which isotropic CT images provide. The alleviation of this situation needs an efficient diagnostic/treatment system employing
isotropic images. For this reason, we focus on developing an
approach of segmenting lung lobes from isotropic CT images
(referred to as CT images from here on in).
Recent advances in virtual reality technologies have made
three-dimensional (3D) visualization of lungs feasible for diagnosing and treating lung diseases [2]–[4]. Compared to
2-D grayscale CT images, 3-D visualization of lungs provide

multiviewpoints, colors, stereoscopic views, and no need of
mental reconstruction. Our previous study has revealed that 3-D
visualization of lungs can significantly reduce surgeons’ workload and planning time, as well increase the accuracy of lung
surgeries [2].
Typical human lungs consist of five lobes, separated by three
fissures (boundaries of lung lobes). The left oblique fissure
(LOF) divides the left lung into two lobes: the superior and
inferior lobes; while the right oblique fissure (ROF) and the
right horizontal fissure (RHF) separate the right lung into three
lobes: the superior, middle, and inferior lobes. In 2-D CT images, fissures appear as curvilinear lines on each CT image
[5]. In a stack of CT images, these fissures form 3-D surfaces
separating adjacent lung lobes. Complete segmentation of the
lung lobes by automatically identifying fissure surfaces—3-D
surfaces formed by fissures in individual CT images—is the
foremost requirement for achieving 3-D visualization of lungs.
Automatic identification of fissure surfaces is a nontrivial task
due to the fissures’ variable shape and appearance, along with
the low contrast and high noise inherited in CT images [5]. As
well, identification of the fissures on individual 2-D CT images
does not always produce a complete segmentation of the lung
lobes. Studies have shown that approximately 70% of fissures
are incomplete and it is impossible to observe them even by
an expert [6], [7]. Furthermore, lung diseases may disrupt and
deform fissures causing discontinuities between fissures in adjacent CT images. Traditional segmentation methods such as
deformable models [8] and level sets [9] are unsuitable for fissure identification due to CT image noise, incomplete fissures,
and the need for manual initialization. Thus, complete segmentation of diseased lung lobes remains an arduous task.
Nevertheless, many research groups have developed pipelined
algorithms to segment lung lobes [10]–[21]. These algorithms
can be grouped into two primary approaches: 2-D fissure approach and 3-D surface approach. The 2-D fissure approach
identifies fissures in individual CT images, whereas the 3-D
surface approach finds fissures and fissure surfaces (i.e., the
connectivity of the fissures) using 3-D anatomic structures of
the lungs. Thus, the former is computationally less intensive
than the latter. Table I provides a summary of these algorithms.
1) Two-Dimensional Fissure Approach: One approach of
segmenting lung lobes is by identifying fissures in individual 2-D CT images. Following this approach, Kubo et al.
used the VanderBurg linear feature detector and morphological operators to find fissures in 25 lungs, 12 of which
contained pulmonary nodules [10]. Zhang et al. combined
a pulmonary atlas, a ridgeness operator, and fuzzy reasoning to identify fissures in seven normal and five diseased

lungs [11]. Using a similar ridgeness operator to enhance
the fissures, Wang et al. employed the Bayesian theory to
identify fissures in ten lungs with pulmonary nodules [12].
Their algorithm yielded high-segmentation accuracy with
manually delineated fissures for initialization. To eliminate manual intervention, we developed an algorithm using wavelet transform to locate fissures in nine lungs with
pulmonary nodules [13]. In general, the 2-D fissure approach works well for identifying disrupted and deformed
fissures in individual CT images; however, it does not always produce complete segmentation of lung lobes, due
to the lack of continuity between fissures in adjacent CT
images.
2) Three-Dimensional Surface Approach: Another approach
of segmenting lung lobes is by finding fissure surfaces
using 3-D anatomic structures within the lungs. Kuhnigk
et al. used a segmented vascular tree and an interactive
watershed transform (IWT) to find fissure surfaces in 24
lungs [14]. Ukil and Reinhardt extended this algorithm
by automating the IWT using segmented vascular and
bronchial trees [15]. They then used a graph search to
refine fissure surfaces in 12 normal and 17 emphysema
lungs. Their algorithm worked well for lungs with emphysema; however, one-quarter (25%) of their lungs required manual correction [15]. Following the same approach, Zhou et al. used Voronoi division to locate fissure surfaces in seven normal lungs [16]. Similarly, Saita
et al. employed a sheet-emphasis filter to extract fissure surfaces in 16 normal lungs and four lungs with
unknown diseases [17]. Using a slightly different strategy, Van Rikxxort and Ginneken first enhanced fissures
in individual CT images using a set of supervised filters [18], and then utilized a segmented bronchial tree to
find fissure surfaces in 20 unspecified normal/abnormal
lungs [19]. Lastly, Pu et al. used a computational geometry method to first locate fissure patches [20] and then
used implicit radial basis functions to extend these patches
into fissure surfaces in 65 lungs with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease [21]. While the 3-D surface approach
yields complete segmentation of the lung lobes, it often requires difficult segmentation of anatomic structures
such as the bronchial and vascular trees [22], [23]. More

importantly, current 3-D surface approaches have difficulties in handling disrupted and deformed fissures, which are
often caused by cancer lesions.
To the best of our knowledge, no existing methods have been
tested under all three constraints of: 1) automation, 2) dealing
with multiple diseases, and 3) producing a complete segmentation in the 3-D space, as listed in Table I. To meet these
constraints, we developed a new algorithm employing a hybrid
2-D/3-D approach by first finding fissures in 2-D CT images
using a texture analysis method, followed by a surface fitting
technique based on ridge regression to model actual fissure surfaces in 3-D. Compared to our previous algorithms in [13] and
[24], the novelties of this algorithm include the following two
aspects: fully automatic segmentation of 3-D major (oblique)
and minor (horizontal) fissures using ridge regression in diseased lungs, which often have disrupted, deformed, and/or incomplete fissures; and an increase of segmentation accuracy in
about 10%.
We evaluated our algorithm using lungs with a variety of
different diseases: emphysema, small cell lung cancer (SCLC),
large cell lung cancer (LCLC), and bronchiectasis. To present
our algorithm, we organized this paper as follows: Section II
describes our methodology. Sections III and IV provide the
results and discussion, respectively. Last, Section V gives the
conclusion and future work.
II. METHODOLOGY
Our algorithm (developed in MATLAB) uses a pipelined process to segment diseased lung lobes. The algorithm employs
four stages: 1) preprocessing, 2) 2-D oblique fissure recognition,
3) 2-D horizontal fissure recognition, and 4) 3-D lung lobe segmentation. Fig. 1 depicts the flow diagram of this algorithm.
The following context presents these four stages and evaluation
method in five subsections, respectively.
A. Preprocessing
In this stage, we preprocessed a stack of CT images using the
Wiener filter and lung segmentation methods that we developed
previously [13]. The Wiener filter reduces the noise inherited
in isotropic CT images, while the lung segmentation method

decreases computation time by removing area outside of the
lungs. Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b) illustrate example cross-sectional
and sagittal images (see Section II-C) from a preprocessed CT
stack, respectively.
B. Two-Dimensional Oblique Fissure Recognition
To identify the oblique fissures in a stack of cross-sectional
CT images, we used a method based on our preliminary algorithm [24]. In short, this method uses three steps to recognize the oblique fissures in pathological lungs: 1) texture analysis, 2) fissure region analysis, and 3) fissure identification. In
the first step, we performed 2-D texture analysis (instead of
3-D to reduce computation) by dividing all images in the preprocessed CT stack into overlapping region-of-interests (ROIs)

with dimensions of 10 × 10 pixels. The selection of 10 pixels
corresponds to the width of typical fissure regions. We used
gray-level run length texture features [25] and a feed-forward
back-propagation neural network (NN) [26] to classify these
ROIs as either a fissure or nonfissure ROI. For NN training, we
employed a set of predefined ROIs in the lungs. As a result,
the first step of texture analysis yields a stack of binary images
containing classified fissure and nonfissure ROIs. Fig. 3(a) and
Fig. 3(b) illustrate an original CT image and the matching binary
image yielded by the first step, respectively.
To find regions containing the fissures (fissure regions) in the
second step of fissure region analysis, we performed a stack
projection followed by a line fitting. The stack projection transforms the binary stack into two accumulation images (a left and
a right accumulation image) showing the propagation of fissure regions in the yz plane (see Fig. 2). The two accumulation
images correspond to the left and right lungs. For each accumulation image, the line fitting calculates a straight line (propagation line) to extract the locations of the fissure regions for each

image in the binary stack. The propagation line calculated from
the right accumulation image is also used for the horizontal
fissure recognition (see Section II-C). Fig. 3(c) and Fig. 3(d)
present an example right accumulation image and the corresponding propagation line calculated from the line fitting, respectively. Fig. 3(e) depicts fissure regions (white pixels) found
within the binary image in Fig. 3(b) using the calculated propagation line.
In the last step of fissure identification, we combined the
found fissure regions in the binary stack and the images in the
preprocessed CT stack to identify the actual fissures. Fig. 3(f)
gives example fissures found within the fissure regions shown
in Fig. 3(e). As illustrated in Fig. 3(f), fissures found by the
algorithm do not extend to edges of the lungs due to diseases and
incomplete fissures (addressed in Section II-D). More detailed
description of the aforesaid method can be found in [24].
C. Two-Dimensional Horizontal Fissure Recognition
Our previous work [24] did not identify the horizontal fissure
that is more challenging to segment than the oblique fissures.
Compared to the oblique fissures, the horizontal fissure lies
more parallel to the cross-sectional plane (xy plane) of a CT
image stack than the oblique fissures. This makes the horizontal
fissure less visible in cross-sectional CT images. Studies have
shown that a greater percentage of horizontal fissures appear
incomplete than oblique fissures [7], [27]. In 22% of all cases,
no horizontal fissure was found at all [27]. Surgeons/radiologists
also face difficulties in identifying the horizontal fissure in a
stack of cross-sectional CT images [interview with surgeons/
radiologists]. Thus, preprocessing a CT image stack is needed
before handling the identification of the horizontal fissure.
Based on the general lung anatomy, the horizontal fissure
has a more consistent shape and appearance when viewed from
the sagittal plane (yz plane) instead of the cross-sectional plane
(xy plane). Surgeons/radiologists routinely use the sagittal plane
for identifying the horizontal fissure in clinical settings [interview with surgeons/radiologists]. Therefore, we took the same
approach of using the sagittal plane to automatically find the
horizontal fissure. To achieve this, we performed the following
steps in series, as indicated in Fig. 1:
1) Stack Rotation: We first rotated the preprocessed CT stack
90° clockwise about the x-axis and then 90° counterclockwise about the z-axis. We sliced the rotated stack in the yz
plane using the same size as the original voxels (volumetric pixels), yielding sagittal images of the stack. Fig. 2(b)
shows example sagittal images from a rotated CT stack.
2) Left Lung Removal: We narrowed the search space for the
horizontal fissure by discarding sagittal images containing
the left lung. To achieve this, we computed the lung area
on each sagittal image of the rotated stack by counting the
number of pixels inside the lungs. Fig. 4(a) plots the lung
area against sagittal images along the x-axis. We discarded
all images lying outside of the left peak in Fig. 4(a), which
corresponds to the right lung.
3) Right Lower Lobe Removal: To further narrow the search
space, we removed the right lower lobe from the remain-

ing sagittal images. In each image, we deleted all pixels,
pi (x, y), satisfying the following condition:
y < mx + b

(1)

where m and b are the slope and y-intercept of the propagation line calculated from the right accumulation image
in Section II-B. Two-dimensional Oblique Fissure Recognition. Although some oblique fissures may have a slightly
curved appearance in the sagittal images, the straight line
in (1) provides a good approximation of the oblique fissure
for our purpose of removing the right lower lobe. Fig. 4(b)
illustrates an example propagation line laid over a sagittal
image of the rotated CT stack. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the
propagation line provides a close approximation of the
oblique fissure in the sagittal image. Fig. 4(c) depicts the
same sagittal image with the lower lobe removed using
this propagation line.
4) Fissure Region Analysis: To find regions containing the
horizontal fissure, we used the method of texture analysis and stack projection as described in Section II-B.
However, instead of applying the texture analysis on the
original cross-sectional CT images, we used the sagittal images derived from the first step, Stack Rotation, as
shown in Fig. 2(b). We removed the left and right lower
lung lobe to reduce computation. Fig. 4(d) and Fig. 4(e)
depict a binary image produced by the texture analysis
and an accumulation image yielded by the stack projection, respectively. In the accumulation image, bright pixels
represent large continuous regions (spanning the y-axis) in

the binary images. White arrows in Fig. 4(e) indicate the
propagation of the horizontal fissure region, which shows
the correlation of z-location of horizontal fissure region
for each sagittal image in the x-axis. To extract this propagation, we performed dynamic programming [28], which
finds the optimal path from the top to the bottom of the
accumulation image satisfying the following constraint:

K

I(pk )
(2)
max
k =1

where pk (k = 1, . . . , K) is the kth pixel in the path of K
connected pixels, and I(pk ) is the pixel intensity of the
pixel pk . Using this correlation, we selected the largest
continuous region within 10 pixels of the corresponding
z-location as the correct fissure region. We selected
10 pixels since that is the width of a typical horizontal
fissure region. In some cases, the largest region may not
expand all the way to the edge of the lung. Thus, we selected all regions that are within 10 pixels of the largest
region as part of the fissure region too. Fig. 5(a) shows a
binary image where white and light gray pixels represent
the largest region and its selected neighboring regions,
respectively.
5) Fissure Identification: We used the bounding box of all
selected regions in the binary images to define the fissure region in the sagittal CT images. Fig. 5(b) shows an
example fissure region found from Fig. 5(a). Within the
fissure region, we performed dynamic programming using (2) to find the optimal path extending from the left to
the right of the fissure region. Fig. 5(c) illustrates a fissure
found from the fissure region in Fig. 5(b) using dynamic
programming.
D. Three-Dimensional Lung Lobe Segmentation
The oblique and horizontal fissure recognition uses 2-D texture analysis and fissure anatomy to find the fissures. Although
this approach yields good approximations of the fissures in individual 2-D CT images, it does not produce complete segmentation 3-D. This is due to the fact that many fissures appear incomplete in 2-D CT images. As well, lung diseases may disrupt

and deform existing fissures causing discontinuities between
fissures in adjacent CT images. Fissures appear naturally as
3-D surfaces separating adjacent lung lobes. Therefore, the most
logical method for producing a realistic segmentation of the lung
lobes is to model a 3-D surface (fissure surface) for each of the
LOF, ROF, and RHF, using fissures found in individual 2-D CT
images. This hybrid 2-D/3-D approach also provides the benefit of being able to fill in incomplete and disrupted fissures
automatically.
To ensure that only the correct fissures are used to model
the fissure surface, we first performed fissure verification by
comparing fissures in adjacent CT images. For each fissure on
a cross-sectional CT image, we computed its accuracy as the
percentage of its pixels satisfying the following condition:

(y1 − y2 )2 + (x1 − x2 )2 < 2 pixels
(3)
where (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ) are the coordinates of a fissure pixel
and its closest counterpart in the previous adjacent CT image,
respectively. The 2 pixel criterion in (3) ensures that fissures
in neighboring CT images are connected. We chose all fissures
with an accuracy of >80% (based on experimentation), in five
or more consecutive CT images, as the correct fissures. We
selected a range of five or more consecutive images to prevent
false verification due to a single incorrectly found fissure.
Once the fissures are verified, we represented each fissure
pixel pi (xi , yi ), as a voxel (a point in 3-D), vi (xi , yi , zi ),
where zi denotes the ith cross-sectional CT image that the fissure pixel pi resides in. Using this set of n-validated voxels,
{vi (xi , yi , zi ), i = 1, 2, . . . , n}, we modeled a fissure surface in
the form of
z = f (x, y).

(4)

Many 3-D modeling methods exist [29], [30]. One method
is the minimization of energy functions, as used by Pu et al.
[21]. While this method produced smooth approximations of
fissure surfaces, it is computationally intensive (Pu et al. had to
down sample from 200 000 points to 3000 points during their
surface modeling). For our surface modeling, we used a method
based on ridge regression [31]. Ridge regression introduces regularization to the standard least squares (LS) formulation. This
method carries several advantages over common fissure modeling techniques: 1) provides control over the smoothness of the
fissure in the 3-D plane; 2) reduces the sensitivity to erroneously
found fissures; and 3) is computationally and memory efficient.
To derive ridge regression for our purpose of fissure modeling,
we started by using linear regression to model the relationship
between the z and x–y coordinates of each fissure voxel with the
equation
ẑi = w0 + w1 xi + w2 yi + e

(5)

where ẑi is the estimated value of zi , while e represents the
modeling error. Similarly, for n voxels, we could model the
same relationship using a set of n equations, expressed in a
matrix notation
z = Aw + e

Thus, (6) represents a linear regression model, where w denotes the parameters of our fissure surface. The simplest method
for solving this linear regression model would be the LS method.
The LS method estimates w, by minimizing the sum of squares
of the errors


wm in = min Aw − z2 .
(8)
Despite the simplicity of the LS method, it carries two drawbacks: 1) local inconsistency with the continuity of input data;
and 2) oversensitivity of small errors in the input causing a few
outliers to skew the estimation or prediction model.
Ridge regression alleviates these two drawbacks of the LS
method by using regularization. Given a linear regression model
shown in (6), ridge regression estimates the parameters w by
performing the following minimization:


(9)
wm in = min Aw − z2 + Γw2
where Γ is the regularization term. The implementation of ridge
regression is as follows: 1) transform the LS formulation to
obtain uncorrelated components, 2) apply regularization to the
model to achieve a desired property, and 3) restore the original
coordinate system by reversing the original transform.
In the first step of ridge regression, we transformed the (x, y)
coordinates of the voxels into a linear index aij by using the
equation

1, ifj = yi + xi Dx
aij =
0,
otherwise
i ∈ [1, n], j ∈ [1, m], m = Dx × Dy

(10)

where Dx and Dy are the pixel dimensions of a cross-sectional
CT image in the x- and y-axes, respectively. Thus, the ridge
regression formulation becomes

In the second step of ridge regression, we applied regularization. Regularization provides several advantages for fissure
surface modeling. One, it allows the modeling of a nonlinear fissure surface using a simple linear model. Two, it allows control
over the smoothness of the surface. Three, it reduces sensitivity
to outliers in the data, i.e., erroneously found fissures. In order to
produce a smooth fissure surface, we used Laplacian functions
(along the two independent axes, x and y) as our regularization

(12)

where α is a scale factor that controls the effect of regularization.
The minimization of the Laplacian functions ensures minimal
changes in the gradient of our fissure surface. This allows us
to control the smoothness of the fissure surface by varying the
scale factor α. We selected an optimal α value of 1 for our
evaluation (see Section III, regarding the effect of α on the
accuracy of segmentation). In the last step of ridge regression,
we computed our fissure surface in the original x–y coordinates,
z(xi , yi ), by reversing the transformation of (10). We reversed
the transformation by using the equation
z(xi , yj ) = wm in (i + jDx )

(13)

where wm in is the result of (9) while i, j, and Dx are as defined
in (10).
E. Evaluation Method
For evaluation, we used isotropic CT image stacks from
24 anonymous patients (following Canadian tricouncil ethics
guidelines) at the Foothills Medical Center, Calgary, AB,
Canada. A Siemens Sensation 16 multislice CT scanner acquired these image stacks using the standard Foothills Medical
Center Thoracic Abdominal 3-D Research protocol and iodine
contrast agent. All images have a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels
with a thickness of 0.6 mm. Of the 24 patients, 23 had lung
diseases and one had no diagnosis. Table II lists the types of
diseases associated with these patients. To evaluate our algorithm, we employed a twofold cross-validation method [26] by
splitting the datasets from the 24 patients into two groups. For
each group, we randomly selected half of the datasets containing
each disease. This ensures a good representation of all diseases
for each group. For diseases where only one dataset is present
(Patients 21–24), we randomly placed the dataset into one of
the two groups. Of the two groups, we used one group for training and the remaining group for testing. We swapped the two
groups to test all 24 datasets. Finally, we repeated the aforesaid
procedure ten times and averaged the result.

For performance evaluation, we compared the output of our
algorithm to that of manual segmentation. While our algorithm
yields complete segmentation of the lung lobes, it is extremely
time consuming for a radiologist to completely trace all fissures
in 24 patients with an average of 300 CT images per patient. To
make the evaluation process more feasible, we used manually
placed anchor points to mimic manual segmentation. Under the
guidance of a radiologist, we manually placed anchor points (at
about 5 pixels apart) on fissures for every fifth image of a CT
stack, which is approximately the thickness of the CT images
that surgeons/radiologists read in clinical settings. Using this
manual segmentation, we performed the following analysis:
1) One-way Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA):
One-way MANOVA examines statistically a significant
difference between two groups of measurements [32]. In
our case, the two groups of measurements are the fissure
pixel coordinates (xi , yi , zi ) produced by our algorithm
and manual segmentation. By computing a corresponding
pair of Wilk’s lambda (λ) and p-value, one-way MANOVA
tests the null hypothesis that the two groups of pixel coordinates are different. If the p-value is greater than 0.05,
the null hypothesis is rejected, meaning that no significant
difference exists between the pixel coordinates produced
by the two methods of segmentation.
2) Agreement Analysis: MANOVA is designated to test a significant difference between two groups of measurements.
If the test fails, the one-way MANOVA does not indicate
whether these two groups of measurements are in agreement. Thus, we applied the Bland and Altman analysis of
agreement [33]. The details of this analysis were described
in our previous work [24].
3) Percentile Analysis: The aforesaid analyses lack a percentile measure that surgeons/radiologists prefer in clinical settings [interview with surgeons/radiologists]. To
compute a percentile measure, we used the percentage
of fissure pixels satisfying the ±3-mm criterion, as defined in our previous work [24]. We selected 3 mm since
it closely approximates the thickness of clinical CT images that surgeons/radiologists read. We calculated the
percentile measure of the 3-mm criterion for each CT
image, in order to evaluate the relationship between segmentation accuracy and the fissures’ position within the
lungs (superior to inferior regions). The number of CT
images is then normalized across all testing datasets. We
averaged the percentile measure across all datasets. This
shows the segmentation accuracy for fissures located in
difference regions of the lungs. Using all the three analyses, we evaluated our algorithm (in MATLAB) on patients
with a variety of different lung diseases.
III. RESULTS
Using the 24 anonymous patients, we compared the results
of our automatic segmentation to that of manual segmentation.
Fig. 6 illustrates example segmentation results from two patients
(left and right columns). Arrows in Fig. 6(a) and (b) indicate
the LOB, ROB, and RHF in original CT images. As shown in
Fig. 6(c) and (d), our algorithm produced good approximations

with respect to the CT image slice number (red—superior and blue—inferior).
The arrow in (e) indicates a deformed fissure surface caused by a lesion. Image

of the three fissures (white lines) in Fig. 6(a) and (b). Fig. 6(e)

algorithm. The arrow in Fig. 6(e) points to a fissure surface that is

of our algorithm for complete segmentation of diseased lung
lobes.

column (Disrupted) presents three examples of completely disrupted fissures. In all the three examples, our algorithm was able
to successfully identify the disrupted fissures. The middle left
column (Affected) shows examples where fissures are affected
by different diseases. Again, our algorithm produced close approximations of the affected fissures. The middle right column
(Fuzzy) depicts example segmentation results for fissures with
fuzzy appearances. As shown in this column, these fissures are
barely visible to the naked eye. Still, our algorithm yielded accurate segmentations of these fissures. Last, the rightmost column
(Incomplete) shows examples of incomplete fissures. In this
case, our algorithm extended these fissures to the boundaries
of the lungs. Fig. 8 illustrates a case where the right horizontal
fissure is affected by a lesion. Our algorithm produced accurate
segmentation of the right horizontal fissure despite the fuzziness
caused by the lesion.
Tables III–V present the evaluation result for segmenting
the LOF, ROF, and RHF, respectively, in all 24 patients.
Within a confidence interval of 95% (p > 0.05), our one-way
MANOVA indicated that our algorithm was able to successfully segment (no significant difference found between manual and automatic segmentation) the LOF, ROF, and RHF in
23, 24, and 22 of the 24 patients, respectively. Within these
patients, our algorithm yielded root mean square (RMS) errors of 2.21 ± 1.21, 2.51 ± 1.36, and 2.38 ± 1.27 mm for
segmenting the LOF, ROF, and RHF, respectively. The corresponding mean differences for the LOF, ROF, and RHF are
1.49, 1.52, and 1.66 mm with maximum distances (worst case
errors) of 10.69, 13.00, and 7.50 mm. Using our ±3-mm percentile measure, our algorithm produced accuracies of 86.59%,
84.80%, and 82.62% for segmenting the LOF, ROF, and RHF,
respectively.
Fig. 9 plots the average RMS error (of all patients) for different values of the smoothing coefficient α. We selected an α
value of 1 to provide the best balance between fissure smoothness and segmentation accuracy. Using this α value, our algorithm yielded RMS errors of 2.04 ± 0.68, 2.97 ± 0.93, 1.90
± 0.75, and 2.77 ± 1.21 mm for patients with mild emphysema, moderate emphysema, SCLC, and LCLC, respectively.
We omitted diseases with less than three datasets (see Table II).
Fig. 10 illustrates the accuracy distribution for segmenting the
oblique fissures using our surface modeling algorithm (solid
line), our previous oblique fissure recognition algorithm [24]

modeling algorithm (solid line); (b) our previous algorithm [24] (dotted line);

(dotted line), and manual segmentation by radiologists (dashed
line).
IV. DISCUSSION
Our algorithm uses a hybrid 2-D/3-D approach to segment
diseased lung lobes by modeling 3-D fissure surfaces from fissures found in individual 2-D CT images. This approach has
several benefits. First, our approach allows detection of fissures
in cancerous lungs, where fissures are often disrupted and deformed by lesions. Second, our hybrid approach produces complete fissure surfaces allowing the lung lobes to be visualized
in three dimensions. Third, the approach has the advantage of
being able to extend incomplete fissures to the boundaries of the
lungs using the 3-D fissure surfaces. Last, the approach allows
control over the smoothness of the fissure surface by varying
the smoothing coefficient α. This ensures smooth connectivity
between fissures in adjacent CT images.
Compared to current state-of-the-art algorithms [8]–[19], our
algorithm yielded comparable RMS errors, but dealt with multiple lung diseases. In cancerous diseases, our algorithm yielded
lower RMS errors in lungs with LCLC than in lungs with
SCLC. This is attributed by the faster growth and metastasis rate of SCLC, which causes more disrupted and deformed
tumors. These results demonstrate our algorithm’s ability to

segment disrupted and deformed fissures. In emphysema lungs,
where the lung tissue is affected, our algorithm produced lower
RMS errors in lungs with mild emphysema than in lungs with
moderate emphysema. As expected, the severity of the disease
correlates inversely with the accuracy of the segmentation. For

other diseases listed in Table II, unfortunately, we did not have
enough testing lungs to make a reliable observation.
Compared to our previous algorithms in [13] and [24], the new
algorithm produced a percentile accuracy that is 10% higher.
More importantly, the new algorithm brings several novelties:

1) fully automatic horizontal fissure segmentation, 2) ability to
handle multiple diseases, and 3) complete 3-D segmentation in
presence of disrupted, deformed, and incomplete fissures. In
general, the accuracy of our segmentation correlates with the
position of the fissures within the lungs, as shown in Fig. 10.
Our algorithm produced the lowest percentile accuracies when
the fissures are in the inferior and superior regions of the lungs,
where fissures are typically shorter, thus harder to find. Maximum errors occurred when large lesions completely disrupted
fissures or near the edges of some incomplete fissures. Overall, our algorithm reached a percentile accuracy of 85% in over
70% portion of the lungs for segmenting diseased lung lobes in
isotropic CT images. In comparison, surgeons/radiologists obtain an accuracy of 80% for identifying fissure regions in thicker
clinical CT images [interview with surgeons/radiologists]. From
this perspective, the automatic segmentation of diseased lung
lobes is comparable to the identification of lobar fissures by
surgeons/radiologists in clinical settings. In contrast, it is not
feasible for surgeons/radiologists to manually identify all the
fissures in a stack of isotropic CT images in a busy clinical
setting.
While our algorithm produced comparable segmentation results with surgeons/radiologists, it also carries a few limitations.
First, the use of a NN-based classifier requires proper training.
Sufficient training data for a particular disease are a prerequisite
for successful segmentation. In patient 19, the LOF segmentation failed due to limited NN training for lungs with bronchiectasis. In this case, only two patients with bronchiectasis were

available for our evaluation, resulting in only one bronchiectasis
patient being used for training. Second, robust detection of the
horizontal fissure remains a tricky task for our algorithm. As
shown in Table V, our one-way MANOVA detected significant
difference between the automatic and manual segmentation of
the horizontal fissure in two of the 24 patients. This is mainly
due to the variability in the shape of the horizontal fissure. In
these two particular cases, the horizontal fissures were much
shorter than the average (approximately 50% shorter), making
them difficult to identify. Last, our algorithm inherits the long
computation drawback of texture analysis. Benchmarked on a
Xeon 3.2-GHz PC with 2-GB RAM running MATLAB 7.04
(R14), texture analysis took approximately 90 min on average
per patient, while the remaining processes took about 6 min. The
processing time for texture analysis can be reduced through parallelization in the future. As well, this stage can be performed
offline to minimize the impact on the clinical viability of the
algorithm.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In conclusion, we developed a new segmentation algorithm
for diseased lung lobes. Using a hybrid 2-D/3-D approach
of modeling 3-D fissure surfaces from fissures found in individual 2-D CT images, our algorithm produced complete
segmentations of diseased lung lobes, where fissures are often disrupted, deformed, and incomplete. Using the statistical
analysis of agreement, our algorithm produced RMS errors of

2.21 ± 1.21, 2.51 ± 1.36, and 2.38 ± 1.27 mm for segmenting
the LOF, ROF, and RHF, respectively. The average accuracies
for segmenting the LOF, ROF, and RHF are 86.59%, 84.80%,
and 82.62%, correspondingly. These results indicate the feasibility of developing an automatic algorithm for complete segmentation of diseased lung lobes. Future work includes: further
evaluation of our algorithm using more diseased lungs and
enhance the performance of the algorithm by porting it from
MATLAB into C/C++.
