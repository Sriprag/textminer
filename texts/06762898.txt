A Brief History of Tissue Models
For Cardiac Electrophysiology
Craig S. Henriquez∗ , Member, IEEE

Abstract—The last four decades have produced a number of
significant advances in the developments of computer models to
simulate and investigate the electrical activity of cardiac tissue.
The tissue descriptions that underlie these simulations have been
built from a combination of clever insight and careful comparison
with measured data at multiple scales. Tissue models have not
only led to greater insights into the mechanisms of life-threatening
arrhythmias but have been used to engineer new therapies to treat
the consequences of cardiac disease. This paper is a look back at
the early years in the cardiac modeling and the challenges facing
the field as models move toward the clinic.

I. INTRODUCTION
VEN at the turn of the 20th century, there was considerable debate as to whether cardiac tissue was syncytial
or cellular. In their seminal work, Sir T. Lewis and colleagues
investigated the fibrous anatomy of the dog heart and used the
Einthoven string galvanometer to map the excitation pathways
on the surface of the atria and ventricles [1], [2]. Their results
showed that despite a complex fiber architecture “the whole of
the musculature of the ventricle is one uniform syncytium” and
the spread of excitation appeared syncytial [4]. One of the early
cardiac histologists, H. Jordan noted in 1911 that “the designation of cardiac muscle as a tissue of discrete cells or as a syncytium depends upon the interpretation given to the so-called
intercalated disks or junctional lines (also, bands of Eberth),
i.e., whether or not they mark cell boundaries” [5]. With the improvement and increased use of electron microscopy in the 40s
and 50s, there was growing evidence that cardiac tissue was not
a syncytium but rather was composed of discrete, rod like cells,
bounded by a membrane, which in places was continuous with
the intercalated disk [6]–[8]. Analyses of the images revealed
that the cell membrane was greatly folded in the region of the
intercalated disk and spacing between cells between opposing
faces of the disk was tighter than for nondisk membrane [6].
Measurements of the electrical properties also presented conflicting view of the nature of cardiac tissue. In 1951, Curtis

and Travis argued that the measured “all-or-nothing” spread of
electrical activity in Purkinje fibers is consistent with functional
protoplasmic continuity between adjacent cells, and concluded
that the system acts as a “functional syncytium” [9]. These findings were supported by measurements of specific core resistance of Purkinje fibers by Weidmann [10] who concluded that
the intercalated disks do not form a significant barrier to ionic
movement along the length of the fiber. Because Purkinje fibers
had function similar to nerves, it was unclear whether the same
behavior would be seen in the working myocardium. Sperelakis
et al. found that the resistance between the interiors of two
frog ventricular cells was about twice the resistance of one cell,
consistent with a nonsyncytial structure, and was higher than
the extracellular current path [11]. These and similar measurements performed on transverse membranes by the Sperelakis
group suggested that that there are no low resistance pathways
between cells and postulated that other, possibly nonelectrical
mechanisms might govern impulse conduction [12].
In 1961, Woodbury and Crill performed an important study
to investigate whether the spread of excitation takes place via
local circuit currents or some other mechanism in working myocardium [13]. They performed a very simple test of injecting
current into a cell and measuring the response in neighboring
cells. Their results showed that current traversed several cells
in both dimensions, but the spread was not equal. The effective length constant of the decay of potential, however, is not
straightforward to interpret since the expected spread of current
in two-dimensions was not exponential as is the case for a 1-D
fiber. Nevertheless, they found the spatial decay to be twice as
long parallel to the fiber direction than transverse to the fiber
direction. This directional difference in the length constant was
consistent with the observed directional differences in conduction velocity and anisotropic electrical properties [14].
Woodbury and Crill also used a mathematical model to compute the disk resistance [13]. Assuming that the distance of
the gap between cardiac cell membranes at disk is 80 Å, they
estimated that the specific resistance of the disk needed to be
1 Ω·cm2 or less to ensure efficient intercellular transmission.
However, the measurement was 40 times smaller than what
was required to explain the magnitude of the measured space
constant they measured. So, while the evidence was overwhelmingly supportive of the nonsyncytial nature of cardiac tissue, the
effect of the intercalated disk on action potential conduction
remained unclear.

solution of the equations underlying the action potential of the
giant axon of the squid, formed the foundation for the modern
view of computational models of all excitable tissue [15]–[17].
It was quickly realized that the ability to simulate the activity in
excitable cells would require advances in both the computational
algorithms and the computational speed. In 1960, Denis Noble
used the University College London’s Ferranti Mercury computer (with a performance of 10 kiloFLOPS!) [18] to simulate
the Purkinje fiber action potential from a modified version of the
Hodgkin Huxley equations [19]. In 1965, two IBM researchers,
Cooley and Dodge, used a digital IBM 7094 computer to solve
the nonlinear partial differential equation that coupled the cable
equation and the Hodgkin Huxley model for the ion flux [20]. By
the end of the 1960s, digital computers were more commonly
available to the research community and their access fueled the
rapid development of computational electrophysiology.
The idea of modeling cardiac tissue as a network of interconnected discrete units was first proposed by Moe, Rheinboldt,
and Abildskov in 1964 [21]. Rather than basing the interconnections on the cable theory and the excitability on description
of ion channels, Moe et al. developed an automata model where
rules governed the conduction of impulses from cell to cell.
While the model lacked the biophysical descriptions, it was
able to demonstrate the ability of such models to study complex activity underlying arrhythmias, which became the focus
of cardiac modeling in the decades that followed.
Surprisingly, the first biophyically based cardiac tissue model
did not use the classical cable theory, used for the unmyelinated
axon, but attempted to account for the discrete structure and
elucidate the electrical properties of the intercalated disk. In
1970, Heppner and Plonsey formulated a circuit representation
of two cardiac cells and the gap region that separated them [22].
Their goal was to investigate transmission across a single gap
using a modified Hodgkin Huxley model, developed by Noble,
for the ionic currents traversing the cardiac cell membrane.
Their model predicted a gap resistance of 4 Ω·cm2 was needed
for successful transmission, similar to the value determined by
Weidmann using radiopotassium tracing methods [23].
In the early 1970s, Duke University was home to a number of
investigators with broad interests in cardiac electrophysiology
from ion channels to clinical measurements. Investigators like
M. Spach, R. Barr, T. Johnson, M. Lieberman, T. Pilkington, J.
Sommer, M. Kootsey, and T. Gallie represented fields of clinical cardiology, cell biology, physiology, computer science, and
biomedical engineering, and partnered to perform some important research in the field. The synergy of this group with diverse
technical backgrounds led to rapid advances in both the basic
biophysics and modeling of cardiac tissue. Motivated by the
experimental work of Spach et al. on AV nodal tissue [24], M.
Lieberman and colleagues, developed the first active 1-D tissue
model to help explain the mechanism of very slow conduction
in a strand of cultured cardiac cells [25], which served as an in
vitro model of the AV conduction pathway. While a very early
paper, the authors made several important observations regarding the use of this particular approach to model tissue. First, they
recognized that “when the cable is continuous, the axial resistance can be increased without limit, producing any arbitrarily

slow velocity of propagation.” They noted that the spatial discretization should not be reduced below a reasonable cell length
to account for the discrete nature of cells. They also recognized
that the resistance properties should somehow reflect the extracellular space. Their model showed that assumptions regarding
the structural and membrane properties could have profound
effects on the velocity of propagation in cardiac tissue.
In 1975, another group from Duke University developed the
first 2-D model of cardiac tissue. R. Joyner, F. Ramon, and
J. Moore, who was one of early computational neuroscientists [26], constructed a tissue sheet model that assumed a rectangular arrangement of membrane patches. The idealized arrangement was picked primarily to apply the numerical method of an
alternating directional implicit solution for rows and columns.
Although they used the Hodgkin Huxley equations for the membrane currents, their model was able to demonstrate the elliptical
spread of activation when the electrical properties differed in the
two principle directions.
While computer models of both discrete and continuous tissue
were shown to be feasible, an important focus of the computational community was to develop better models of the ionic
currents of the cardiac membrane. McAllister, Noble, and Tsien
developed the first complete ionic model of Purkinje fiber and
included a slow inward current in 1975 [27]. A ventricular cell
model was developed by Beeler and Reuter in 1977 [28] soon
followed. As more data were collected, the models of the membrane were refined current by current. For example, Ebihara
and Johnson offered an important early modification of the description of the Sodium current [29]. Current membrane models
are sophisticated and detailed and have been developed for a
variety of species [18], including descriptions for the human
myocyte [30], [31].
B. Evidence for Discontinuous Propagation
Despite the recognition of the discrete nature of cardiac tissue, most macroscopic measurements suggested that the spread
of excitation was relatively continuous. In 1981, Spach and colleagues presented the first evidence that conduction at the microscale was influenced by the discrete cellular structure [32].
In particular, they found that the shape of the action potential
time courses depended on the direction of propagation: “Fast
upstrokes were associated with low propagation velocities (in a
direction transverse to the long cell axis) and slower upstrokes
were associated with high propagation velocities (in the direction of the long cell axis).” Slow, transverse conduction also
gave rise to action potentials with notches and was safer (less
likely to fail) than conduction along the long axis of the cell.
Such directional differences in action potential shape and safety
could not be explained by a continuous, anisotropic model and
indicated for the first time that tissue structure at the cellular
scale could play a role in arrhythmogenesis.
The work of Spach et al. sparked a number of simulation
studies to show that discreteness could explain the directional
differences in action potential shape. Diaz, Rudy, and Plonsey extended the work of Heppner and Plonsey, and developed
a fiber model of 35–50 cardiac cells with an intercalated disk

between every two cells [33]. Here, the individual cells were discretized at subcellular resolution (see Fig. 1). With this model,
they were able to change the resistance of the intracellular and
disk resistance independently, which could not be done experimentally. They found that increasing the disk resistance led to a
decrease in conduction velocity but an increase in the rate of rise
of the upstroke. This relationship of slow velocity and fast upstroke was consistent with Spach et al. observations. They also
reported that conduction along the discrete fiber was nonuniform. The velocity within one cell was significantly faster than
the average velocity—reflecting a delay across the disk. This
discontinuous propagation also gave rise to notches or fractionation of the simulated extracellular potential close to the
fiber.
Building on the work of Diaz et al., Henriquez and Plonsey
found that the waveshape also varies within the cell [34]. They
showed that V̇m ax , values at the end of the cell proximal to a
junction are larger than the average. while those on the end distal
to the junction are smaller than average. As the magnitude of the
coupling resistance increases, the average V̇m ax , first increases,
and then, decreases as gap resistance increases and the firing
of the cell became more synchronous. They also noted greater
agreement in the conduction velocity predicted by cable theory
using average properties and that obtained with the discrete
model than observed in the earlier model of Diaz et al.
Rudy and Quan explored the parameter space over a much
wider range and also showed that the deviation from cable theory was seen only at very high gap resistances, and above a
certain value, decremental conduction was possible [35]. A critical difference between the models of Henriquez and Plonsey
and Rudy and Quan used that Rudy and Quan used a Beeler
Reuter model that had long plateau phase that was later shown to
have a significant effect on maintaining conduction [36]. Their
model suggested that conduction velocity in a discrete structure could get much slower than in an equivalent continuous
structure. All the 1-D discrete models failed to explain a reduction in the time constant of the early rising phase of the action

model.

potential, termed “tau foot,” seen in the experiments of Spach
et al. This early rise was postulated to be due to the passive
charging of the distal membrane ahead of the wavefront. Rudy
and Quan found that a slight reduction in tau foot was observed
for wavefront collisions that might more prominent in higher
dimensions.
In 1991, Leon and Roberge developed the 2-D coupled cable network to study the influence of lateral coupling on both
planar and curved wavefront propagation [37]. With a staggered topology, planar transverse wavefronts gave rise to local collisions at the output resistors and led to an expected
rise in the maximum rate of rise. Leon and Roberge found the
safety factor is greater transverse to the fibers, as suggested by
Spach et al.’s experiments [32], but the brick wall model does
not predict a faster rising foot for action potentials conducting
across fibers. Muller–Borer et al. constructed a similar discrete
model but incorporated gap junctions along fibers, with spatially
varying cell lengths and random connections across fibers (see
Fig. 2) [38]. Their model revealed significant variation in waveshapes and conduction velocity throughout the tissue owing
to the random structure. Spach and Heidlage further extended
this approach by constructing a discrete cell model where the
cell shapes were derived from digitized photomicrographs of
a slice of disaggregated tissue [39], [40].Three types of gap
junctions were distributed around the cell based the experimental work Saffitz [41] and Severs [42] groups: Plicate, interplicate, and combined plicate. Like the model of Muler–Borer,
conduction revealed spatially varying action potential rate of
rises and microscopically nonuniform conduction. The main
advantage of this more detailed model over previous models
was the ability to explore the effects of cell shape/width, celloverlap, and gap junction types on conduction under normal and
abnormal conditions.

shown here as a passive resistor–capacitor circuit. The four conductivities σi x ,
σe x , σi y , and σe y define the passive conductive properties of the intracellular
and interstitial spaces, respectively.

C. Bidomain Models of Cardiac Tissue
Cable theory describes the excitable cell as having both an
intracellular space and an extracellular space separated by a
membrane. For cardiac tissue, the two spaces extend over regions encompassing many cells in three-dimensions. In 1969, O.
Schmidt proposed a conceptual model of cardiac tissue as being two volume-averaged “interpenetrating domains” coupled
through the membrane, each extending throughout the region
of interest and independent of the cell boundaries [43]. He proposed the lumping of electrical properties in such a way to enable
a syncytial representation of tissue that could be described by
continuous partial differential equations. While Schmidt proposed the concept of interpenetrating domains to deal with intracellular and extracellular spaces, the first formal description
of such a model was given by a series of papers by Muler and
Markin [44]–[46]. Their work recognized that the anisotropy
of the intracellular and extracellular spaces could be the same
(equal), different (unequal), or even flipped (reciprocal) and as
result, the shape of the conducting wavefront should be affected.
Tung [47], in his Ph.D. dissertation, and Geselowitz, who had
read the dissertation, together with Miller formalized the model
for its application to cardiac tissue and recognized that the bidomain model was simply a 3-D version of the cable equations
(see Fig. 3) [48]. The typical formulation that grounded the extracellular space was later referred to as the monodomain model
to distinguish from the bidomain. Barr and Plonsey developed
the first active bidomain model of a sheet of tissue [49]. Their
model reproduced the general theoretical predictions of Muler
and Markin and showed that the shape of the action potential
could also be affected by the nature of the interstitial properties.
Henriquez and Plonsey, and Roth considered the effects of
yet another extracellular feature, the presence of an adjoining
bath [50]–[52]. Henriquez and Plonsey found that in a model
of the cross section of a cylindrical bundle of tissue bath, the
activation from was curved with the surface conduction leading
that in the center. The conduction velocity was between that
expected in a single fiber lying in an extensive bath and that
in a fiber with a restricted extracellular space. The transmural
gradient in potential led to a redistribution of currents so that
the rate of rise of action potentials at the surface is slower than
it was deeper in the tissue. Roth found a similar changes of the

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MAY 2014

transmembrane potential away from the bath and showed that
the conduction velocity slows as the cells become more tightly
packed [52]. The model also reproduced the large changes in
the interstitial potential into the depth as shown by Plonsey and
Barr [53]. The depth dependence of the interstitial potential of
a tissue in a bath was later observed experimentally by Knisley
et al. [54].
Henriquez and Papazoglou developed an active 3-D bidomain
model to determine whether the directional differences in action potential waveshape could be explained by a slab of tissue
with unequal anisotropy bounded by a bath at the surface [55].
This model reproduced the changes in the foot and maximum
rate of rise consistent with the experiments of Spach et al. [56],
suggesting that the directional differences in extracellular properties, including the depth, cannot be fully ignored under critical
conditions near conduction failure.
Finally, the effect of cell packing on conduction velocity was
recently reexamined by Roberts et al. [57]. Using a novel 3D, multidomain model of coupled cells, where the intracellular
and extracellular spaces were represented as spatially distinct
volumes, they found as the cell packing became tighter uniformly, conduction slowed as seen in the bidomain model [52].
However, under the assumption that for very tight packing, the
conductivity of the spaces between cells reduces, then the membrane adjacent to the tight space can be functionally eliminated
from participating in propagation, resulting in an increase in
conduction velocity. This result supports the hypothesis that fast
conduction in Purkinje Fibers occurs because the tight packing
causes the strand to act as single large cell [58].
D. Heart Geometry and Fiber Structure
The slab geometry represented an important step toward developing more realistic heart geometries that included both
intracellular and interstitial properties and fiber orientations.
While the fiber architecture had long been known give rise to
anisotropic conduction, the early cardiac models only considered propagation in at most two dimensions. In 1991, three
studies marked the beginning of the use of 3-D cardiac models
with representations of transmural myocardial fiber orientations
in cardiac electrophysiology. Leon and Horacek lay the groundwork for developing active, whole heart models. In this study,
the spread of subthreshold currents in a simplified ventricular
geometry with fiber rotation was governed by the anisotropic
bidomain theory and the suprathreshold behavior (action potential) was assigned like a cellular automata [59]–[61]. In the same
year, Pollard et al. developed a fully active 3-D monodomain
slab that incorporated intramural fiber rotation and a Hodgkin–
Huxley like membrane model [62]. Finally, P. Hunter and his
group at Auckland University presented an efficient mathematical representation of the fiber architecture in the canine heart
based on careful histological analysis with the goal of creating
finite element and finite difference models for subsequent electromechanical analysis. Panfilov and Keener were the first to
use this Auckland heart geometry to build a realistic, biventricular model to explore 3-D reentry in the heart [63]. Rogers and
McCulloch were the first to apply the more numerically flexible

representations of the anatomy and fiber architecture. Both experiments and models have shown that factors that affect the
tissue structure and ionic currents can be arrhythmogenic [70].
As a result, a number of groups are actively working to develop platforms to use heart models to help guide clinical planning and decisions [71]–[73]. The recent work on using models
to guide VT ablation by Trayanova’s group is showing great
promise [74]. Bringing modeling to the clinic, however, will
require advances in both computational techniques and a better
understanding of human electrophysiology.

finite-element approach to consider the effects of the fiber curvature, and material inhomogeneity on propagation [64]. Harrild
and Henriquez later used the finite-volume method (a variant of
finite elements) to develop the first membrane-based model of
3-D conduction in a realistic atrial geometry [3], which included
the fast and slow pathways (see Fig. 4).
The Auckland heart geometry allowed investigators to investigate how the macroscopic tissue architecture affected the
dynamics of electrical activity. Unfortunately, the techniques for
acquiring the fiber data using histology are extremely time intensive. The development of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) by
Peter Basser and colleagues in the mid 1990s opened a new era
of performing nondestructive histological analysis of tissues under a variety of conditions [65]. Several groups showed that the
method could be applied to cardiac muscle and the diffusion tensor estimates correlated well with direct histological measurements even at the scale of several hundred microns [66], [67].
Muzikant et al. incorporated DTI data into a bidomain model
of a block of tissue and showed that patterns of activation and
the extracellular potentials correlated well with measurements
made with an array of extracellular electrodes on the surface of
a canine heart. The approach of using DTI data in heart models
has been successfully applied to a variety of ventricular preparations from the mouse [68] to human [69].
II. FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CHALLENGES
The last decade has seen rapid advances in so-called multicale models that include molecular level models governing the membrane and subcellular metabolic dynamics with

Until very recently, the time required to simulate the dynamics
in domains as large as the human heart over clinically meaningful time scales has been prohibitively long. Barr and Plonsey
once predicted that the brute-force simulation of 10 ms of activity in a bidomain model with only 106 nodes using the computers
available in 1984, would require 3000 years to complete [49].
They remarked that “because of the uncertainty about the longterm stability of the social security system, they chose not to
attempt this calculation.” Instead, they used a clever method of
tracking only the active region, showing that solving problems
of this type would require a combination of new algorithms and
faster processors.
Whether modeling at the macroscale or at the microscale, the
number of parameters defining the tissue structure and membrane properties for a human-sized heart can easily exceed the
memory available on the largest single processor [75]. There
have been significant efforts and advances in algorithms and
numerical techniques over the past two decades to radically
reduce simulation times and improve accuracy to enable simulations at the level of the whole heart with realistic fiber structure
and sophisticated membrane descriptions [76]. This, of course,
has been helped with marked increases in both processor and
memory performance. Barr and Plonsey’s daunting 106 node
problem is now considered to be routine. In 2006, Potse et al.
simulated 600 ms of activity in a 26M node bidomain model
representing the human heart at 200 um resolution in two days
using 32 processors in parallel [75]. Niederer et al. reported 1 s
of human heart simulations could be performed in 5 min on
16 384 processors [77]. Of course, large computing facilities
are not available to all researchers. Graphic processors, however, developed for gaming can be used in parallel to achieve
significant speedups. Neic et al. showed that 25 processors were
equivalent to a single GPU when computing the bidomain equations [78]. This new capability to solve the governing equations
on a relatively small GPU cluster makes it possible to one day introduce simulation using patient specific computer models into
a clinical workflow.
B. Uncertain Tissue Properties
While simulations will need to get significantly faster to investigate dynamics over clinically relevant time scales of seconds
or minutes, there still remains much uncertainty about the properties to assign to cardiac models, particularly under diseased
conditions. At present, continuous models are typically used to

1462

represent domains as large as a human heart. The conductivities assigned to model elements along and across fibers in these
models are loosely based on a relatively small number of experimental studies [79]–[81]. Plonsey and Barr critically examined
these and other studies and found that a given set of measurements could be interpreted as widely varying conductivity values
depending on the choice of model [82]. Four decades of cardiac
modeling have shown that the choices of the conductivities and
geometric properties, like cell radius, can have profound effects
on the velocity and nature of propagation [76]. In many cases,
investigators simply choose parameters values that give reasonable velocities in the 30–80 cm/s range. The conductivity across
fibers is usually assigned to be ten times smaller than along
fibers to give a conduction velocity that, according to the square
root relation, is three times slower, consistent with the values
obtained by Clerc [80], and Roberts et al. [79].
The 10:1 anisotropy ratio, however, has been shown to be very
sensitive to cell geometry and gap junction properties. Several
theoretical models have predicted much larger ratios ranging
from 196:1 [83] to 30:1 [84]. Recently, Henriquez and Ying reexamined the theoretical models and showed that the anisotropy
ratio is highly dependent on cell radius and the assumption of
gap junction distribution, which are expected to change under
disease conditions. They also found that to explain the typical
ratio of 10:1 and model velocities of 30–80 cm/s, the number
of open gap junctions had to be in the high range corresponding to a gap junction resistance that was 10 times smaller than
usually assumed [85]. The sensitivity of the conductivities to
the gap junction resistance is further confounded by the fact
that the resistance is voltage dependent. While model studies
have shown that normal conduction is likely not affected by this
voltage dependence [86], it is possible that scenarios, like ischemia, which generate large gradients of repolarization could
alter electrical properties [87] and contribute to conduction failure. In general, there remains uncertainty as to the quantitative
parameters to assign to models. Several groups are have proposed several new methods to obtain electrical conductivities
in normal and diseased tissue in situ using multisite stimulation
and recording [88]–[90]. Understanding all the factors that affect the microscopic and macroscopic electrical properties and
performing the measurements in vivo over a range of conditions
remains an open challenge to the field.
C. Model Validation
To demonstrate that a given model has some predictive power,
it is necessary to show that the model can reproduce some
known behavior. As heart models have become larger and more
complex, validation has become increasingly difficult. Most experimental and clinical measurements are limited to the two
surfaces. In 1970, Durrer and colleagues presented a landmark
study in which they mapped the electrical excitation sequence
in isolated human hearts with 870 surface and intramural electrodes. In their work, they reconstructed the 3-D patterns of activation and identified the early and late breakthrough sites [91].
Taccardi and colleagues used multisite mapping to study the influence of fiber architecture on conduction in the dog heart [92].

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MAY 2014

Like Spach, Taccardi’s work was performed in partnership with
mathematicians, statisticians, and computational scientists to
better understand the underlying mechanisms of tissue structure
on electrical activation and served to guide the development of
3-D models [93]–[95].
While there have been significant advances in mapping technologies and analysis, there have been relatively few investigations with human hearts that can be used to compare with
model results. Optical mapping methods offer some promise,
but motion and the presence of an epicardial fat layer offer some
technical challenges [96]. Efimov’s group has presented some
new work using optical mapping of tissue wedges of failing and
nonfailing human hearts [97]. This approach, coupled with immunostaining, revealed differences in the transmural gradient of
repolarization and expression of gap junctions in the two states.
Such data on the spatiotemporal properties of both the anatomy
and membrane are critical for building better human heart models. Obtaining sufficient information about these membrane and
fiber distributions will be very challenging given the current
limits of clinical measurements. Another promising approach
for validating whole heart models is to use electrocardiographic
imaging, which noninvasively images cardiac electrical activity in the heart [98]. Recently, He and colleagues demonstrated
that a new 3-D cardiac electrical imaging method, which uses
current sources, has the ability to noninvasively identify important features of ventricular excitation throughout the myocardium [99], [100]. These 3-D inverse techniques may prove
critical in developing and tuning the next generation of patient
specific models of the heart.
D. Developing Standards
While progress has been significant, the models have not realized their full potential as a complementary tool of generating
hypotheses that drive experimental inquiry. Unlike other fields,
there is a still a lack of standardization of modeling software
and algorithms in cardiac electrophysiology. This is particularly
problematic, as the problems get bigger and more complex.
The availability of tools like OpenCMISS [101], CARP (cardiac arrhythmia research package) [102], Cardiowave [103],
FieldML [104], and SCIRun [105] suggests that some standards
will be developed in time, but long-term, software maintenance,
portability ,and user training remain obstacles to widespread
adoption of a single tool. There is also concern that a given tool
will lack the computational power for the problems of interest,
and thus, many groups continue to use their own software. Nevertheless, without some standards, it may become increasingly
more difficult to trust the output of large scale models, eliminating one of the greater strengths of simulation, its reproducibility.
III. CONCLUSION
There is no physiological system that has been modeled in
as much detail as the heart [106]. In 45 years, the descriptions have evolved from a single fiber of a few cells to full
3-D representations of the whole heart. These models have been
used to investigate the role of gap junctions, fiber orientation,
ion-channel kinetics, nonuniform ion channel distribution, and

geometry on the genesis and maintenance of arrhythmias like
ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (see [76], [107],
and [108] for reviews). Often in combination with experimental
studies, tissue models have also been used to explore pharmacological, surgical and electrical interventions for treating arrhythmias. For example, Garfinkel et al. used a model to explain how
flattening restitution with bretylium converted VF into a periodic rhythm in the canine heart [109]. Recently, Luther et al.
used a tissue model to design a low energy stimulation strategy to terminate fibrillation in vivo [110]. The latest generations
of tissue models are now incorporating both the electrical and
mechanical activity, allowing the ability to develop more effective biventricular pacing methods to improve cardiac output for
patients in heart failure [111]. The continued coupling of experiment and computer models will undoubtedly help to accelerate
the engineering of new strategies for treating cardiac disease,
which remains an important grand challenge in medicine [112].
To meet the needs of developing better therapies, the expected
trend is that models will get more detailed and will need to better
account for the heterogeneity and stochastic nature of processes
that affect both tissue and membrane properties. As the models
increase in complexity, however, they become increasingly more
challenging to analyze. One might imagine that a time will
come that simpler representations will be needed to “model the
model” to gain insights as to which features are most critical to
the emergent behavior [76].
This brief review has shown that cardiac tissue models have
served as seamless partners with experiments and have provided
new ways to think about the underlying electrophysiology, even
before the measurement techniques had been perfected or the
measurements made. Woodbury and Crill’s work used equations to gain insights into the uncertain properties of the gap
junction and its effect on propagation [13]. In their basic form,
the bidomain equations reveal the complex interplay of the intracellular and extracellular spaces on current flow [113]. In short,
the tissue models have markedly shaped the current thinking
of how the heart conducts impulses under normal and diseased
conditions. The successful partnership of simulation and experiments in cardiac electrophysiology should serve as a model
for other areas of systems biology. While much of modeling
relies on good intuition, the models themselves need to evolve
as we learn more about the biophysics. History shows that the
community is ready for the challenge.
