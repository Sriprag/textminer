for Estimating Passive Ankle Torque
With Subject-Specific Adaptation

Abstract—Background: Robot-assisted ankle assessment could
potentially be conducted using sensor-based and model-based
methods. Existing ankle rehabilitation robots usually use
torquemeters and multiaxis load cells for measuring joint dynamics. These measurements are accurate, but the contribution as a
result of muscles and ligaments is not taken into account. Some
computational ankle models have been developed to evaluate ligament strain and joint torque. These models do not include muscles
and, thus, are not suitable for an overall ankle assessment in robotassisted therapy. Methods: This study proposed a computational
ankle model for use in robot-assisted therapy with three rotational
degrees of freedom, 12 muscles, and seven ligaments. This model
is driven by robotics, uses three independent position variables as
inputs, and outputs an overall ankle assessment. Subject-specific
adaptations by geometric and strength scaling were also made to
allow for a universal model. Results: This model was evaluated using published results and experimental data from 11 participants.
Results show a high accuracy in the evaluation of ligament neutral
length and passive joint torque. The subject-specific adaptation
performance is high, with each normalized root-mean-square deviation value less than 10%. Conclusion: This model could be used
for ankle assessment, especially in evaluating passive ankle torque,
for a specific individual. The characteristic that is unique to this
model is the use of three independent position variables that can
be measured in real time as inputs, which makes it advantageous
over other models when combined with robot-assisted therapy.
Index Terms—Ankle assessment, computational model, robotassisted therapy, robot-driven, subject-specific.

I. INTRODUCTION
OBOTS have been developed for the treatment of various
ankle injuries over the past decades. Wearable devices are
usually aimed at ankle rehabilitation during gait exercises, while
platform robots can only do ankle training [1]–[6]. Zhang et al.

[7] systematically reviewed various ankle rehabilitation devices
and demonstrated their effectiveness in clinical applications.
It was concluded that few existing robots conducted real-time
ankle assessments to control the robot. The knowledge of ankle
kinematics and dynamics may allow for the alteration of control
strategies of robot-assisted therapy based on real-time ankle
performance.
Ankle assessment is essential in robot-assisted therapy. Zhang
et al. [8] reviewed both qualitative and quantitative assessment
techniques. They concluded that the most quantitative assessment techniques are reliable in measuring ankle kinematics and
dynamics but are usually only available for the sagittal plane.
Few studies conducted ankle assessments in a three-dimensional
space where foot motion actually occurs [9]. Most ankle rehabilitation devices use torquemeters and multiaxis load cells
for measuring joint dynamics [10], [11]. These measurements
are accurate but expensive. Further assessment at the level of
muscles and ligaments is also lacking, although Naito et al.
[12] conducted the identification of ankle muscle length using
inverse kinematics.
Ankle assessment at the level of muscles and ligaments usually consists of cadaver-based sectioning studies [13], [14],
invasive techniques [15], and image-based methods [16].
Cadaver-based and invasive methods are not suitable for rehabilitation. The high computation of image-based techniques
limits their applications in real-time robotic environments. In
a better way, some computational models have been developed
for ankle assessment at the level of muscles and ligaments. Liacouras and Wayne [17] proposed a computational approach
to model the lower leg to study syndesmotic injury and ankle
inversion stability. This model simulated ligament sectioning
experiments and actual foot motion were not fully represented.
Lindner et al. [18] created an ankle model, but with only lateral
ankle ligaments included. Wei et al. [19] established a computational model for determining dynamic ankle ligament strains
by inputing kinematic data from a six-camera Vicon MX Capture System. The issues of setup and time-consuming analysis
process impede its application in robot-assisted therapy. More
recently, Wei et al. [20] revised this model with three DOFs
at two joints, in which the rotational axis of ankle inversion
and eversion locates between the talus and the calcaneus. This
model could provide ligament strains and joint moments but
was only validated for ankle supination. In general, these evaluated models have been demonstrated to identify the kinematics and dynamics of the foot–ankle complex for some specific

applications. However, these models do not include muscles
and, thus, are not suitable for an overall ankle assessment in
robot-assisted therapy.
The objective of this study was to develop and validate a
novel computational ankle model for use in robot-assisted therapy. This robot-driven model uses three independent position
variables as inputs while outputting an overall ankle assessment
(kinematics and dynamics of ankle joint, muscles, and ligaments). It was developed to allow for subject-specific results by
scaling a general musculoskeletal model to enable the application to most of the population. This paper mainly focuses on the
establishment of the ankle model, subject-specific adaptation,
and model validation.
II. METHODS
A computational ankle model with three rotational DOFs and
19 force elements (FEs) was constructed for use in robot-assisted
therapy. These 19 FEs consist of 12 muscles and seven ligaments. Subject-specific adaptations by geometric and strength
scaling were made based on participants’ height and weight to
enable the application to most of the population. This robotdriven model considers three independent position variables as
inputs, and outputs the kinematics and dynamics of individual
muscle/ligament and the ankle joint, as shown in Fig. 1. Two
significant assumptions are: 1) ankle motion exists at a single joint between the tibia/fibula unit and the talus/calcaneus.
The tibia/fibula is fixed during robot-assisted therapy, while
the talus/calcaneus rotates in three rotational DOFs; and 2) the
rotational axes of ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion (DP), inversion/eversion (IE), and abduction/adduction (AA) intersect at
one point to facilitate its use in robot-assisted therapy.

A. Model Formulation
This ankle model was created based on the lower extremity
model developed by Delp et al. [21] in OpenSim [22] and analyzed in MATLAB 2013b. The lower extremity model indicates
DP at the ankle joint and IE at the subtalar joint. The AA was
added in the proposed model for use in three-dimensional robotassisted ankle therapy. These three rotational axes were modified

in OpenSim to orthogonally intersect at a point considered as
the rotation center of the ankle–foot complex in robot-assisted
therapy. Seven ligaments spanning this joint are included in
the model and represented by linear elements. The corresponding attachment locations are determined from dissection and
anatomical atlases [23], [24], as shown in Fig. 1 and Table I.

Muscles included are the same as that in Gait2392 available
open through to OpenSim source software [22], but only sections connecting the tibia/fibula and the talus/calcaneus are used,
as shown in Fig. 1 and Table I. Ligament stiffness summarized
by Wei et al. [25] based on published data is used in this study
and passive muscle force was calculated based on muscle length
with respect to neutral length [26].
Definitions of the ankle coordinate system proposed by the
Standardization and Terminology Committee of the International Society of Biomechanics were adopted in this model
(with dorsiflexion, abduction, and inversion defined as positive,
while plantarflexion, adduction, and eversion defined as negative) [27]. Three coordinate frames, respectively, denoted as
tibia/fibula, talus, and calcaneus were defined to describe foot
motions. The tibia/fibula frame xyztib , the talus frame xyztal ,
and the calcaneus frame xyzcal keep the same as that in the
lower extremity model. xyztib is fixed and no movement exists
between xyztal and xyzcal . The coordinate of these attachment
points described in xyztib could be obtained by translation based
on ankle anatomy and rotation based on ankle motion, as shown
in (1) and (2), where p represents the coordinate of the attachment point with respect to a certain coordinate frame, R is the
rotation matrix depending on three independent angular variables denoted by θdp , θie , and θaa , and Ttia−tal and Ttal−cal are
the translation matrices decided by ankle anatomy

B. Subject-Specific Adaptation
This general model represents a young adult male with a
height of 1.8 m and mass of 75 kg. Subject-specific adaptations
in evaluating passive ankle torque were conducted on nine young
adults (six males and three females) with age 26.11 ± 2.03 years
old, height 172.67 ± 11.26 cm, and weight 70.33 ± 18.48 kg.
Subject-specific adaptations in estimating ligament lengths were
conducted on two additional adults (a male with age 35 years
old, height 176 cm, and weight 85 kg; and a female with age
27 years old, height 166 cm, and weight 51 kg). Participants
were required to have no history of severe ankle injuries, no
acute ankle sprains within the last year, and no acute symptoms
of pain or weakness. Table II summarizes the characteristics of
participants and scaling factors used in the proposed model.

C. Experimental Data
Experimental data regarding the relationship between ankle
position and passive torque were collected by a manual ankle
assessment device. This device mechanically consists of a handle for manual operation, a moving platform, and a footplate
rigidly fixed with an ankle orthosis. The components used for
sensing include an angular potentiometer and a six-axis load
cell (M3715C, Sunrise Instruments), which is the same as the
end effector of “Robotics” in Fig. 1. The rotational axis of the
ankle orthosis was made to be consistent with that of the moving
platform.
Participants were instructed to sit on a height-adjustable chair
with the hip and knee joints in 90° of flexion. The ankle–foot

complex was fixed onto the footplate by an ankle orthosis. The
rotational axis of the ankle orthosis was visually adjusted to
approximate the ankle joint. Participants were verbally encouraged to relax the foot–ankle complex to minimize the effects
by muscle activations. Extremes of ankle DP depended on the
subjective sensation from participants until the foot is tense. The
rotation was considered to be quasi-static with angular velocity
less than 8 °/s to reduce the effect by velocity. Five cycles (starting from neutral position defined as the ankle position where the
foot and the leg are perpendicular to each other in sagittal plane
based on [29], to extreme dorsiflexion, to neutral position, to extreme plantarflexion, and getting back to neutral position) were
conducted on each participant. This study was approved by the
University of Auckland, Human Participants Ethics Committee (9348) for experimentation on human subjects, and consent
was obtained from all participants. Data regarding the neutral
lengths of ankle ligaments were obtained from two adults using MRI. The images were obtained using a Siemens Skyra 3T
scanner and T1 weighted volume 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.6 mm in a sagittal plane. The lengths of ankle ligaments were measured offline
using syngo fastView.

D. Model Validation
Data based on the published literature [14], [16], [30]–[32]
and passive torque collected from participants were used for
model validation. The lengths of ankle ligaments depend not
only on the bone geometry, but also on their origin and insertion
points on bones. An accurate ankle model should output accurate
ligament lengths, and thus, ligament lengths could be considered
as a measure for model validation. Many researchers have investigated ligament lengths in the neutral position through either
cadaver sectioning or image-based methods like MRI technique,
as summarized in Table III. The summary means and standard
deviations (SDs) were determined by metaanalysis using the
random effect model [33]. The experimental and modeling results were compared for each participant using mean average
deviation (MAD), root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), and
normalized root-mean-square deviation (NRMSD) for evaluating the subject-specific adaptation performance, as respectively
shown in (7)–(9). mi and ei represent modeling and experimental value at each selected step i, step refers to the moment for

III. RESULTS
A. Neutral Ligament Length
Muscle and ligament length for any ankle position is assumed
to be obtained from this computational model. Fig. 2 compares
the model-based neutral ligament length with published data
summarized in Table III. It was found that modeling results
were reasonable and to some extent verify the effectiveness of
this model.
B. Passive Ankle Torque
Ankle torque could be divided into passive torque and active torque. Passive ankle torque was calculated and compared
with experimental results. Muscles’ active contribution to ankle
dynamics is not in the interest of this study. Fig. 3 plots the
total passive ankle torque in DP, and contributions by muscles
and ligaments are also presented separately. Individual FE force
distributions with ankle position can be seen from Figs. 3–5.

0.4926%, 0.5326%, and 3.0034%, respectively. The individual
contribution of each FE is clearly presented.
C. Subject-Specific Adaptation Performance
This model was mainly developed to be subject specific in
evaluating passive ankle torque based on participants’ height
and weight by two scaling (geometric and strength) factors.
Comparison curves on each participant are shown in Fig. 9 and
statistical data are summarized in Table IV. MAD values are
less than 1 N·m, except for the one using S1 on participant No.
2. RMSD values are less than 1 N·m, except for the one using
S1 on participant No. 2 and the ones using S2 on three female
participants. All NRMSD values are less than 10%. To present
the significance of subject-specific adaptation, statistical results
with no scaling (NS) are also included in Table IV. The results
from participant Nos.’ 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 present good modeling
accuracy with all NRMSD values less than 4%, while those from

participant Nos.’ 5, 7, 8, and 9 do not with all NRMSD values
greater than 13.8%.
The evaluation of passive ankle torque correlates with the
ligament lengths. The performance of the subject-specific adaptation in evaluating ligament lengths is presented in Table V,
where the model-based neutral length of each ligament compares well with that from MRI data with all differences less
than 1 mm.
IV. DISCUSSION
The potential of this model for use in robot-assisted ankle therapy is discussed first. The required kinematic inputs to existing
computational models are usually obtained from marker-based
motion capture systems [35]. This motion analysis technique is
not convenient when combined with robot-assisted therapy due
to the issues of setup and time-consuming analysis. The required
inputs to the model are three independent position variables that
could be easily sensed from existing ankle rehabilitation robots.
The devices described in [3] and [4] represent two typical ankle
rehabilitation robots, with or without physical rotational axes
of end effectors. Both can use linear potentiometers to evaluate the posture of the end effect using forward kinematics or
only a multiaxis inclinometer. An alternative method for robots
with physical axes is to use angular potentiometers. In general,
the required inputs to this model could be easily obtained from
robotic devices, which provide the basis for use in robot-assisted
ankle therapy.
Existing computational ankle models are usually developed
for ligament analysis for certain specific applications. The overall ankle joint torque could not be reliably evaluated without
considering the contribution of muscles. However, this proposed
ankle model could be used for evaluating ankle joint torque by
computing the contribution of each FE. The use of this ankle
model may permit a less expensive rehabilitation system, for

example by replacing the need to use expensive sensors. Improvement regarding the robotic design for ankle therapy could
be further achieved, although a range of robot-assisted ankle rehabilitation techniques have been demonstrated to be effective
for individuals with ankle injuries [7]. This model could be used
for robot-assisted ankle assessment at the level of joint and FEs.
The model structure is different with ankle anatomy and published models with ankle joint between the tibia/fibula and the
talus and subtalar joint between the talus and the calcaneus [21],
[36]. Siegler et al. [37] concluded that DP mainly exists at the
ankle joint, IE mainly exists at the subtalar joint, and other motion could be the combination of the ankle joint and the subtalar
joint. The DP axis in the proposed model can be approximately
considered to be consistent with ankle anatomy, while the IE and
AA axes are obviously different with ankle anatomy. Thus, direct comparison between modeling results and published data,
mainly in terms of ankle DP, was conducted for model evaluation. Fig. 6 shows passive ankle torque in IE (above) and
AA (below), respectively, where the passive joint torque in extreme inversion was well compared with published data [34]
on subjects with recurrent ankle inversion sprains, although the
maximum positions were not completely consistent.
For model evaluation in DP, both the neutral ligament length
and passive joint torque are considered as the measures. The
measured ankle ROM (−50° of plantarflexion and 40° of dorsiflexion) is considered to be reasonable with high driving torque
applied, which is verified by a physiotherapy expert. Comparisons with published neutral ligament lengths obtained from
cadaver anatomy and MRI were conducted. In Fig. 2, the neutral ligament length calculated from this computational model
shows satisfactory accuracy by comparing with published data.
The main purpose of this model is to evaluate passive joint torque
as foot moves for use in robot-assisted therapy. Modeling results
were compared with experimental data on participant No. 6 in
Fig. 8 and a high accuracy was achieved, with MAD, RMSD,
and NRMSD values being 0.4926%, 0.5326%, and 3.0034%, respectively. The contribution of individual FE, as shown in Figs.
4 and 5, is not validated in this study since no published evidence
has been found. Subject-specific adaptations by geometric and
strength scaling were made in this model.
Comparisons were conducted on each participant and results
show a satisfactory accuracy, with each NRMSD value less than
10%. However, the accuracies vary for different participants, as
shown in Fig. 9 and Table IV, which could be caused by various
factors like age and gender [38], [39]. Most subject-specific
performance on males is close with different strength scaling
factors. Strength scaling using S1 on participant No. 2 presents

less accuracy than that with S2 and the reason could be that S1
does not consider the influence from the fat percent. However,
the subject-specific performance on participants with moderate
BMI values presents better estimation accuracy. NRMSD values
on participants Nos.’ 3, 4, and 8 using S2 are less than 3%.
To present the significance of the subject-specific adaptation,
the accuracy in evaluating passive ankle torque with respect to
NS is also analyzed and presented in Table IV. There are significant differences among these nine participants regarding the
model-based prediction accuracy with NS. The data from participant Nos.’ 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are encouraging, while those from
participant Nos.’ 5, 7, 8, and 9 do not show satisfactory prediction accuracy. The potential reason is that the base model used in
this study represents a young adult male with a height of 1.8 m
and mass of 75 kg, which is closer to those of participant Nos.’ 1,
2, 3, 4, and 6 than others. Further, it can be seen that the subjectspecific adaptation seems more necessary for female subjects
than males, which is clearly presented in Table IV, where the
torque estimation with subject-specific adaptation present significantly improved accuracy with the NRMSD values being
14.7807%, 26.7397%, and 19.6852% for participant Nos.’ 7, 8,
and 9 with respect to all less than 7% without NS. The reason
could be the gender and the body size differences of these three
females as the base model. Another interesting point is that estimation with NS is successful and achieves better results than
“subject-specific adaptation” method for participant Nos.’ 1, 2,
and 4. This behaves abnormal since the subject-specific adaptation does not improve the model-based estimation as expected;
on the other hand, this is normal because the estimation accuracy has been high with all NRMSD values less than 3.5% when
with NS. In general, subject-specific adaptation does not contribute significantly once a high-precision estimation (<10%)
has been obtained. However, a more comprehensive subjectspecific adaptation law should be investigated in near future
with body size, gender, age, health condition, and even ethnic
group all considered.
Some other limitations of the model should be also noted.
The linear representation of muscles and ligaments as being
straight lines between origin and insertion points may affect the
estimation of joint torque. The subject-specific adaptation was
conducted based on participants’ height and weight, and factors
like gender, age, and health condition should be also included for
future improvement. An alternative scaling method can be made
based on foot geometry instead of body height and weight. This
model assumed normal elastic properties of the ligaments and
muscles and, thus, could reliably predict passive ankle torque for
healthy subjects. However, the prediction could be inaccurate

(due to abnormal muscle and ligament property) if the robotic
training is delivered to ankle impaired subjects. For example,
some pathological conditions have not just stiffer ligaments,
but shortened ones. Further improvement will take patients’
health condition into consideration for subject-specific adaption.
Although this model can quantify the individual contribution of
ankle muscles and ligaments, the estimation accuracy was not
validated experimentally. Published data in this field are also
limited.
V. CONCLUSION
This three-DOF computational ankle model with muscles and
ligaments was developed for use in robot-assisted therapy. The
use of three independent position variables required as inputs
offers an advantage over other models when combined with
robot-assisted therapy. This model could evaluate passive ankle
torque in DP, IE, and AA in robot-assisted therapy for a specific
subject as well as the individual contribution of ankle muscles
and ligaments. The information could be helpful for designing
a patient-specific therapy program and have more advantages
than conventional functional assessment. Future studies could
further generalize this model by: 1) incorporating muscles’ active contribution; and 2) scaling the strength of muscles and
ligaments based on the health condition of patients.
