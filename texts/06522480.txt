Point Process Modeling of Interbreath Interval:
A New Approach for the Assessment of Instability
of Breathing in Neonates
Premananda Indic∗ , Member, IEEE, David Paydarfar, and Riccardo Barbieri, Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—Interbreath interval (IBI), the time interval between
breaths, is an important measure used to analyze irregular breathing patterns in neonates. The discrete bursts of neural activity
generate the IBI time series, which exhibits stochastic as well as
deterministic dynamics. To quantify the irregularity of breathing,
we propose a point process model of IBI using a comprehensive
stochastic dynamic modeling framework. The IBIs of immature
breathing patterns exhibit a long tail distribution and within a
point process model, we have considered the lognormal distribution to represent the stochastic IBI characteristics. An autoregressive (AR) function is embedded within the model to capture the
short-term IBI dynamics including abrupt IBI prolongations related to sporadic and periodic apneas that are common in neonates.
We tested the utility of our paradigm for depicting the respiratory
dynamics in neonatal rats and in preterm infants. Kolmogorov–
Smirnov (KS) and independence tests reveal that the model accurately tracks the dynamic characteristics of the signals. In preterm
infants, our model-derived indices of IBI instability strongly correlate with clinically derived indices of maturation. Our results
validate a new class of algorithms, based on the point process theory, for defining instantaneous measures of breathing irregularity
in neonates.
Index Terms—Infant apnea, lognormal distribution, point processes, prematurity, respiratory rhythm, time-frequency analysis.

I. INTRODUCTION

respiratory motor neurons to produce continuous ventilation.
The immaturity of the brainstem circuits governing respiratory
rhythm can result in irregular breathing patterns with prolonged
apneic pauses, a common clinical problem in infants with postconceptional age less than 36 weeks. The apnea of prematurity is
a common cause of recurrent episodes of severe hypoxemia that
has been associated with acute multiorgan dysfunction, developmental delay, and subsequent cognitive impairments [2], [3].
The interval between successive inspirations, the interbreath
interval (IBI), is an important measure of breathing patterns in
neonates. However, breathing patterns are highly nonstationary,
with rapid changes in measures of breathing and to date there is
no algorithm available that can capture instantaneous changes
of IBI. The previous analyses of IBI in infants reveals stochastic
characteristics with a long-tail distribution [4] as well as deterministic dynamic characteristics, for example low frequency
oscillations with periodic apneas [5]. Hence, we propose to develop an algorithm that can capture both the stochastic as well as
deterministic dynamic characteristics of IBI, providing a framework for computing the instantaneous estimates of variability in
breathing.
A basic assumption of our model is that the peak of inspiration, marked by the peak of inhalation recorded noninvasively,
represents a discrete event that marks the timing of neuronal
inspiratory bursts. A second assumption is that IBI dynamics
are governed by continuous processes under the regulation of
multiple feed-back and feed-forward loops impinging upon the
brainstem respiratory oscillator. Our model should be able to
track the instability of breathing in real time and could provide
the risk stratification of the respiratory system that might help
clinicians to devise appropriate interventions for treatment of
apnea of prematurity [3], [6], [7].
Within a point process model, we considered the lognormal
distribution to represent the stochastic nature of IBI and include
a higher p-order autoregressive (AR(p)) model to describe the
dynamic nature of the IBI. The choice of the lognormal distribution was inspired by previous work done on infants, in which it
was shown that IBI in infants follows a long-tail distribution with
the characterizing parameter that changes with maturation [4].
The AR(p) model, a reliable and a simplistic representation,
is considered as a starting point to represent the IBI dynamics.
We estimated the time varying parameters of the point process model by maximum local likelihood approach and assess
the model goodness-of-fit by a Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test
derived from a time rescaling theorem [8]. We illustrate our approach using data from newborn rat as well as preterm infant

recordings, both exhibiting irregular breathing patterns with apnea. A preliminary version of this study has been reported in [9].
II. METHODS
In this section, we present the point process modeling framework that integrates the stochastic model of IBI along with the
dynamic state-space model of IBI, the local likelihood approach
for deriving the instantaneous estimate of the model and the
goodness-of-fit tests to evaluate the performance of the model.
Our model provides a precise probabilistic description of the
IBI at any desired time resolution and allows estimating the
dynamic variation of the parameters.
A. Stochastic Dynamic Model of IBI
Frey et al. [4] showed that IBI follows a power law distribution
with its alpha exponent ranging from ∼2.2 to ∼3.7. There was
a positive correlation between alpha exponent and maturational
age, reflecting a reduction in the incidence of apnea/hypopnea
that make up the long-tail distribution. We note that a power law
distribution with an exponent less than 3 has infinite variance [4].
It has also been shown that for preterm infants, IBI variance
correlates with the incidence of apnea [7]. Therefore, a finite
variance is an important factor in defining infant respiratory
physiology.
The implementation of a power law distribution is feasible
within the point process framework, but the instantaneous assessment of the alpha exponent would drop below and rise above
the threshold for finite variance. Thus, an important requirement
for our study was to use a statistical model of IBI that defines a
finite variance over the range of expected infant breathing patterns, and also includes the long-tail distribution as a feature of
prolonged apnea. To capture these statistical characteristics in
IBI, we propose the lognormal distribution which is mathematically related to the power law distribution [10] and has been
considered in previous work on infants [11].
The IBI is derived from the time interval between successive peaks of the respiratory signal. We considered in
an observation interval (0, T ], successive peaks of the respiratory signal, 0 < u1 < u2 <, . . . . . . . . . , < uk <, . . . . . . . . . ,
< uK ≤ T . Then, we assume that at any given peak uk , the waiting time until next peak of the respiratory signal obeys a history
dependent lognormal probability density f (t|Hk , θ) as

where t is any time, t > uk , Hk is the history of the IBI up
to uk represented as Hk = {uk , wk , wk −1 , . . . ., wk −p+1 } with
wk = uk − uk −1 is the kth IBI, and θ is a vector of model
parameters. The probability density in (1) defines the stochastic
characteristics of IBI with μ (Hk , θ) and σ as the characterizing
parameters that represents the mean and the standard deviation
of the distribution. It can be shown that for a sufficiently large σ,

2859

the logarithm of the density function in (1) will be approximately
linear with respect to the logarithm of IBI, thus reflecting more
closely a power law distribution [10].
The instantaneous mean is modeled using a p-order autoregressive process, AR(p) as
μ (Hk , θ) = θo +

θj wk −j +1 .

(2)

j =1

The characterizing parameters are estimated at each instant of
time, using a local maximum-likelihood approach in which θ (t)
and σ (t) are evaluated using an optimization procedure. Thus,
the time varying representation of the parameters are obtained as
μIBI (t) = μ (Hk , θ (t))

(3)

σIBI (t) = σ (t) .

From the lognormal probability density represented in (1), we
can also evaluate additional instantaneous descriptors

K (t) = e4σ (t) + 2 e3σ (t) + 3 e2σ (t) − 6.

The descriptors M (t), V (t), S(t), and K(t) represent the
instantaneous estimates of mean, variance, skewness, and
kurtosis, respectively, of the lognormal probability density
which can be estimated for any time resolution, Δt.
We can further define the indices of a respiratory rate by
considering the inverse variable r = (t − uk )−1 along with its
probability density f (r|Hk , θ) obtained as

a more detailed characterization of the instability of breathing.
Using (2), we estimated the instantaneous spectrum as

equation θo + pj=1 θj wk −j +1 . We represent the power
spectrum in a time–frequency plane using a precision obtained
by dividing the frequency range of 0 to fs /2 in 512 equal parts.
Thus, 512 corresponds to a frequency of fs /2.
In summary, the descriptors that we employed to study the
instantaneous characteristics of IBI include: 1) mean IBI, M; 2)
variance of IBI, V; 3) skewness of IBI, S; 4) kurtosis of IBI,
K; 5) mean respiratory rate, Mr ; 6) variance of respiratory rate,
Vr ; 7) spectrum, and 8) poles. All these estimated parameters
and descriptors provide a new approach for the assessment of
instability of breathing in neonates.
B. Local Maximum Likelihood Approach
To compute optimal estimates of θ and σ, we can define the
local joint probability density of ut−l:t , with l being the length
of the local likelihood observation interval. If we observe nt
peaks within this interval as u1 < u2 <, . . . . . . . . . , < un t ≤ t
and if θ as well as σ are time varying, then at time t, we estimate
the maximum likelihood estimate of θ̂t and σ̂t to be the estimate
of θ and σ in the interval l. Considering the right censoring, the
local log likelihood is obtained as
log f (ut−l:t |θt ) =

i=2
∞

+ w (t − un t ) log ∫

t−u n t



f ϑ|Hu n t , θt dϑ
(9)

where w (t) is the weighting function for the local likelihood
estimation and we selected as w (t) = e−α (t−u ) with α as the
weighting time constant that assigns the influence of a previous
observation on the local likelihood at time t. As described previously [12], we employ an optimization procedure to estimate θ
as well as σ. Since θ can be estimated in continuous time, at any
time resolution, Δt, we can obtain the instantaneous estimate
of all parameters and descriptors defined in Section II-A.
C. Model Goodness of Fit
The IBI probability model, along with the local maximum
likelihood method, provides an approach for estimating the instantaneous parameters of the IBI distribution. These measures
provide information about the changes in the characteristics of
the distribution due to the irregularity of breathing. However,
it is also essential to evaluate how well the model represents
the IBI. To obtain a goodness-of-fit measure, we calculated the
time-rescaled IBI defined as


τk = ∫ λ t|Ht , θ̂t dt

where

represents a point process observed in (0,T) and

(11)

The conditional intensity is the history dependent rate function for a point process that generalizes the rate function for
a Poisson process. The τk values are independent, exponential random variables with a unit rate. With a transformation
zk = 1 − exp (−τk ), if the model is correct, then zk values are
independent, uniform random variables on the interval (0,1].
Thus, we can employ a KS test to assess the agreement between
zk values and uniform probability density by computing a KS
plot [8]. The KS distance measures the largest distance between
the cumulative distribution function of the IBI transformed in
the interval (0,1] and the cumulative distribution function of a
uniform distribution on (0,1]. The smaller the KS distance, the
better the model in terms of goodness of fit.
D. Experimental Data
To demonstrate our methodology, we considered IBI data
from two different experiment protocols. The first set of IBI data
was obtained from neonatal rats during spontaneous breathing.
Neonatal rats exhibit respiratory patterns and chemoresponses
analogous to preterm infants, including sporadic apneas with
bradycardia and hypoxia, as well as periodically occurring apnea episodes. One to two day old rat pups were placed in a
sealed chamber and breathed through a face mask and pneumotachogram, allowing recordings of respiratory airflow through
the mask. The measurement of pressure within the plethysmographically sealed chamber was an index of respiratory effort.
These previously published studies have documented the occurrence of irregular breathing patterns of central origin [13]. We
analyzed 10 min of recordings during spontaneous breathing in
each of four neonatal rats. The IBI time series was obtained by
measuring the times of peak inspiratory airflow.
The preterm infant data considered in our analysis are associated with a wider study to understand control of breathing in
preterm infants [7]. Data collection were conducted at the Newborn Intensive Care Unit, University of Massachusetts Memorial
Hospital and approved by the Committee for the Protection of
Human Subjects in Research at the University of Massachusetts
Medical School. At the time of study, the infants’ gestational
age was less than 36 weeks and postconceptional age (PCA)
was greater than 30 wks. These infants were breathing room air
or supplemental oxygen through nasal cannulae at a fixed flow
rate. Breathing was recorded using inductance plethysmography (Somnostar PT; Viasys Healthcare, Yorbalinda, CA, USA)
at a sampling rate of 100 Hz. The IBI time series were derived
from successive inspiratory peaks using a custom built peak
detection program with a threshold of detection set at a level
just above the small cardiac fluctuations. Nonrespiratory gross
body movements are occasionally intermixed with respiratory
signal during infant arousals. These signals were not excluded.
We analyzed 10 min of recordings from each of ten infants from
one set of the study and considered 7 h of recordings from five
infants from the second set.
III. RESULTS
In this section, we first validate the performance of the model
with the simulated dataset, and then we present the results
from both the rat and infant datasets. The analysis includes the

estimation of the parameters and the derivation of the descriptors, i.e., the indices of instability of breathing. The order p of
the autoregressive model, AR (p) is determined by the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) [14] as primary point of reference,
insuring at the same time an acceptable goodness-of-fit performance in terms of KS plots and autocorrelation functions. We
studied the relationship of the derived descriptors with the physiology of infants and also evaluated further descriptors from the
spectrum of the AR representation to capture the dynamics of
breathing.
A. Analysis of Simulated IBI
To test the ability of our model to capture the correct probabilistic structure, we generated artificial IBI data from a lognormal distribution with a constant mean, μ = 0.1 and constant σ 2 = 0.16. As an initial trial, we applied our model with
the following parameters: a local likelihood window of length
W = 120 s, time step Δt = 0.15 s, a weighting time constant
α = 0.01 and order p = 8 in the AR model.
Fig. 1 illustrates the estimated instantaneous mean and the
instantaneous variance for one simulation. The KS plots of the
time rescaled quantiles lies within the 95% confidence interval bounds and the autocorrelation function of the transform
was indistinguishable from zero, both indicating the excellent
goodness of fit. The averages of the estimated parameters are
μ̂ = 0.108 and σ̂ 2 = 0.158, which are close to the actual values.
These findings imply that our model can capture the stochastic
lognormal behavior of IBI and can provide an accurate estimate
of the mean as well as the variance.

Next we tested the ability of the model to track the changes
in the variance σ 2 , as such changes have been reported during a
vibro-tactile stimulation provided to the infants using a mattress
to reduce apnea episodes [7]. The ability of the model to track
fast changes depends on the length of the likelihood window
as well as the weighting time constant. To test such capability
we simulated IBI values using the same parameters as previously described, and then we abruptly reduced the variance to
25% for a period of time (568 s), followed by restoration of
the variance back to the original value. The adaptability of the
model is illustrated in Fig. 2. In order to track abrupt changes,
the model has to be less dependent on the history of IBI (i.e,
rapidly forget the past) and have a fast weighting time constant.
However, as we try to capture the abrupt transitions in variance,
the model goodness of fit is affected as the model becomes
sensitive to more subtle changes in IBI in a region where the
variance should remain constant, thereby affecting goodness of
fit. A trade-off strategy is therefore needed. Several simulated
scenarios gave an empirical solution to the most appropriate
combination choices for W, Δt, and α as a starting point before
goodness-of-fit analysis.
B. Analysis of Neonatal Rat IBI
The experimental protocol employed to record respiratory
signal from neonatal rats allows us to obtain IBI time series,
free from any movement artifacts [13], which are very common
in preterm infant recordings. Neonatal rat IBI data gives the
opportunity to test our model in its ability of capturing the
underlying probability distribution as well as the short-term
dynamics of respiratory signals. This also allows us to test the
model in terms of order and KS statistics prior to the application
to the infant dataset.
Fig. 3 shows results from one of the recordings (R1). Here,
the spectrogram in Fig. 3(b) represents the dynamic changes in

case, although three of the data sets provide a better model fit
to data, one rat (R4) did not provide a good fit to the model.
However by reducing the history dependence we were able to
fit the model well to data. Thus, neonatal rat data provides a
way to study the effect of different parameters in capturing the
information from artifact-free IBI data.
C. Analysis of Preterm Infant IBI
As first validation, we compared our lognormal-based model
to a point process model with power law distribution. We defined
the power law distribution as

IBI shown in Fig. 3(a) in the frequency domain. In this specific
dataset, prior to apnea the two higher frequency oscillations
merge and spread, suggesting that prior to impending apnea,
the breathing signal shows the sign of instability. Similarly, the
magnitude of the largest pole (predominant pole) of the system
in Fig. 3(e) (black line) shows an increase in value prior to
apnea.
Immediately after the apnea, the IBI dynamics retains the
unstable pattern and gradually becomes stable. Fig. 3(c) and
(d) potrays the μ and σ 2 estimated from the model, which also
show significant changes prior to apnea. It has to be noted that
the appearance of high frequency power and increase of pole
magnitude observed prior to apnea is possibly due to the irregularity of breathing induced by the respiratory system.
Fig. 4 provides the goodness-of-fit measures using IBI data
from all four rats. With the same parameter values for the model,
the KS plots show different goodness-of-fit measures. In this

wheref (t|αs ) is defined for (t − uk ) > tm in , αs is the exponent
of the power law and tm in is the lower bound. We estimated the
exponent αs by maximizing the respective likelihood function
as in (9) and compared goodness-of-fit results with the lognormal results. As expected, the lognormal-based model provides
a better goodness of fit in all available data. Fig. 5 provides
an exemplary analysis of the estimated αs along with comparison of KS plots of the model with power law and lognormal
distributions.
The preterm infant respiratory signal is highly nonstationary with rapid dynamic changes in physiological state. Our
lognormal-based model could capture both fast dynamics as
well as give an accurate representation of the stochastic structure underlying the IBI data recorded from the infants. Fig. 6
illustrates an example of IBI data along with the estimated μ
and σ 2 . Here, it can be seen that σ 2 shows fast step increases
both prior and during the apnea event. KS and autocorrelation
plots suggest that the model is able to accurately capture the
stochastic structure as well.
We also estimated the spectrum in the time frequency along
with the dynamics of the predominant pole. The example in
Fig 7 (same subject as in Fig 6) shows how both spectrum and
predominant pole can provide the additional dynamic measures
of IBI instability that may be a precursor of apnea.

Since apnea, a pause in breathing, is common in preterm
infants, we studied the effect of such a pause on the instability of
breathing. From the database, we considered infants with at least
7 h of physiological recordings. We identified only those apnea
events that are 10 s or greater and did not have any such apneas
10 min prior to this event. Fig. 8 demonstrates the instability of
breathing in terms of IBI observed in the time-frequency plane.

The integrated power spectrum dynamics is significantly larger
after the apnea episodes, which indicates that the apnea episode
introduces instability in the IBI and instability is maintained for
a long time, in this case, at least three minutes after the apnea
episodes.
We also estimated the poles of the autoregressive process as
a measure of instability of breathing from an infant during an
episode of apnea. The distribution of the predominant pole after
10 min of the apnea episode is different from prior 10 min of
the episode. Fig. 9 represents the dynamics of predominant pole
along with the histogram of the pole magnitude prior 10 min
and the post 10 min of the apnea episode.
D. Statistical Analysis
We studied the relationship of all the derived descriptors (appropriately averaged for each subject and then for all subjects)
to the physiological variables of ten preterm infants. Table I
reports the linear Pearson correlation along with the P -value in
brackets for the preterm infants. It should be noted that S and

K correlate with the PCA and weight of the infant at the time
of study (SW), which suggest that these two descriptors provide
information about the maturation of the infants. As the infant
matures, the probability of apnea reduces, which will reflect in
more skewness and kurtosis of the distribution.
The variance V correlates with all physiological variables
including gestational age (GA) and weight of the infant at the
time of birth (BW). We also computed Spearman’s correlation
coefficient to look for any nonparametric dependence between
indices and physiological variables. We found that variance V
still correlates with GA, BW, and SW with linear correlations
(P -Value) 0.78 (0.03), 0.85 (0.01) and 0.84(0.01), respectively.
However, V did not correlate with PCA and also none of the
other indices had any significant correlations with physiological
variables, except for M and GA with 0.73 (0.04).
We studied the variability of the indices in the subjects by
considering every 10 s or greater apnea episodes in all the five
subjects. There were a total of 27 apnea episodes from five
subjects: 7 from s1, 4 from s2, 3 from s3, 10 from s4, and 3 from
s5. We found that the variance of the respiratory rate (see table II)
is significantly greater after the apnea episode when compared
to values before the episode. This is important considering the

fact that, after the apnea, the infant’s effort to breathe increases
introducing a significant variability in the respiratory rate. All
other measures increase after apnea, although not significantly,
except M and Mr .
To understand which of the descriptors carries more information on the transition before and after the apnea event, we
finally performed a simple discriminant analysis by moving
a linear separating threshold to obtain the receiver operating
characteristics (ROC) curve for each descriptor and for each
combination of two descriptors. Results are reported in table III
and the ROC curves from the most discriminating descriptors
are shown in Fig. 10. We found that the best discrimination
between before and after apnea is obtained from S, K, and the
Pole Magnitude if considering a single descriptor. Combining S
and Pole Magnitude, we obtain the absolute best discrimination
(37% specificity and 67% sensitivity), followed by the M-Pole

IV. DISCUSSION
We have developed a point process modeling framework and
algorithm for analyzing the instability of breathing in neonates.
Our point process modeling framework provides instantaneous
descriptors of instability that can be defined as important precursors of apnea events in individual infants.
Our algorithm is based on the observation that the IBI poses
stochastic characteristics with a long tail distribution and dynamic characteristics with apneas related to low frequency oscillations in breathing. We employed a lognormal distribution
on a point process modeling framework to capture the stochastic characteristics, and a higher order autoregressive model to
capture the instability of IBI associated with apnea and other
irregularities in the breathing patterns of infants.
The advantage of using a point process framework is that
the probability density can be computed at any time resolution
regardless of the duration of IBI. Furthermore, the estimation
of instantaneous indices as well as the power spectrum provides
measures to assess the physiologic development of infants in real
time. The goodness-of-fit tests allow us to select the appropriate
order as well as history dependence and to assess the ability of
the model to capture the data.
In the future, we plan to implement our model in the newborn
intensive care unit to assess the instability of breathing as well as
maturation of neonates. We will also study whether using other
representations can capture the dynamic characteristics of the
IBI as well, such as Volterra series representations [15], [16],
and perturbation series representation of oscillator models [17]
related to respiration.
In our analysis, we assumed that the IBI series follows a distribution with lognormal characteristics. Since it has been hypothesized that different stochastic properties may appear during

2865

periodic breathing [5], one of our future goals is to verify if the
IBI series may be switching between two different types of distribution, in particular between a lognormal distribution and a
separate distribution associated with periodic breathing. To this
extent, the probabilistic representation must include different
types of distributions. We plan to explore such possibilities in
the IBI dynamics and if we observe such a phenomenon, then
we will modify the algorithms to include a multimodal distribution framework [18]. We will estimate the parameters based on
the optimization of the likelihood function of this multimodal
structure.
In addition, by integrating the point process model of IBI
along with the point process model of heart-rate dynamics [12],
[19], we will study whether these models can be used for the anticipation of life threatening events such as apnea, bradycardia,
and hypoxia in neonates. Recent work in mice reveals critical
periods in the vulnerability of cardio-respiratory control to genetic perturbations, for example in 5-HT1 A knockout mice that
exhibit subtle abnormalities in breathing and heart-rate variability [20]. We propose that the point process framework can define
novel dynamical biomarkers that reflect intrinsic vulnerabilities
of cardio-respiratory control.
We used respiratory inductive plethysmography to define
breathing patterns in preterm infants as previously described [7].
This method detects apnea due to a failure of centrally generated inspiratory effort, which is the most common mechanisms
of apnea initiation in preterm infants during sleep [21]. Our
results, therefore, pertain to central apnea. Obstructed breaths
occasionally appear during periods of prolonged central apnea,
manifesting as abdominal movements that are indistinguishable
from an unobstructed breaths using inductance plethysmography alone. The proof of obstructive apnea would require simultaneous measurement of respiratory airflow, which is difficult
to obtain in infants. Future studies that include airflow signals
would be needed to determine how obstructed breaths influence
the statistical properties of the IBI time series and how to capture
this in the point process framework.
It is also important to note that our infant respiratory recordings, while highly sensitive for detecting central apnea during
quiet sleep, cannot reliably distinguish respiratory movement
from other types of axial movements that might occur during
brief arousals. Since transient arousal can be a strong destabilizing influence on breathing [21], future studies are needed
to test the hypothesis that movement per se is a precursor of
apnea. This movement information is already being captured
in our point process model of IBI, as the movement signal is
intermixed with the respiratory signal during arousal.
In conclusion, given the promising discrimination results and
the prospect of being able to consider larger datasets and of
applying more advanced classification techniques, we are confident that the proposed descriptors could provide an accurate
assessment, monitoring, and prediction of the risk of infants to
impending apnea events.
