Segmentation, Separation and Pose Estimation of
Prostate Brachytherapy Seeds in CT Images
Huu-Giao Nguyen, Céline Fouard, and Jocelyne Troccaz∗ , Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—Goal: In this paper, we address the development of an
automatic approach for the computation of pose information (position + orientation) of prostate brachytherapy loose seeds from
3-D CT images. Methods: From an initial detection of a set of seed
candidates in CT images using a threshold and connected component method, the orientation of each individual seed is estimated by
using the principal components analysis method. The main originality of this approach is the ability to classify the detected objects
based on a priori intensity and volume information and to separate groups of closely spaced seeds using three competing clustering methods: the standard and a modified k-means method and a
Gaussian mixture model with an expectation-maximization algorithm. Experiments were carried out on a series of CT images of
two phantoms and patients. The fourteen patients correspond to a
total of 1063 implanted seeds. Detections are compared to manual
segmentation and to related work in terms of detection performance and calculation time. Results: This automatic method has
proved to be accurate and fast including the ability to separate
groups of seeds in a reliable way and to determine the orientation
of each seed. Significance: Such a method is mandatory to be able
to compute precisely the real dose delivered to the patient postoperatively instead of assuming the alignment of seeds along the
theoretical insertion direction of the brachytherapy needles.

I. INTRODUCTION
ROSTATE cancer is one of the leading cancers in men
worldwide with 152 new cases and 23 deaths per 100 000
men reported worldwide per year from 2006–2010 (based
on SEER Cancer Statistics Review) [1]. Low-risk prostate
brachytherapy treatment that uses low dose rate radioactive
seeds, has emerged as a common and highly effective method
to manage localized prostate cancer. The typical implantation
procedure is summarized as follows (see Fig. 1): Based on
dose planning, lines of seeds (stranded or loose) are implanted
through parallel needles. These needles are inserted into the
prostate through the skin of the perineum using continuous
transrectal ultrasound (US) guidance and following a preimplantation planning. Once accurate needle placement has been

confirmed, the seeds are released through the needles. This process is continued until all seeds have been implanted. In practice,
the number of seeds implanted in the prostate commonly ranges
from 40 to 100. The goal of a successful operation is to position
the seeds in order to get the proper dose coverage throughout
the prostate while limiting the risk for the neighboring organs.
In theory, the seeds are aligned in the needle insertion direction. Fig. 2(a) illustrates such a planning scheme. However, in
practice the seed implantation depends on many biomechanical
factors as well as human experience. The seeds may lose their
intended position in spite of any special care or effort used when
placing the needles and delivering the seeds [see Fig. 2(b)]. The
examination of images [computed tomography (CT), X-ray, US
or MRI] often shows that the seeds are not aligned in the implantation direction especially when using loose seeds. In this
later case, the implantation may also result in groups of closely
spaced seeds. In this paper, we name such a group a union-seed.
Fig. 3 shows an example of seed organization in a single CT
slice (including one union-seed). In addition, some seeds can
migrate out of the prostate as reported by Gao et al. [2].
For treatment quality assessment, fluoroscopic images can
be acquired immediately after seed implantation. But generally
CT data are also acquired one month after the intervention and
a CT-based postimplant dosimetry is performed. The delay is
such that any inflammatory modification of the prostate has disappeared and the dose computed from the seed positions can
be considered as the real delivered dose. Most existing commercial treatment planning software (e.g., VariSeed, Interplant
or PSID Brachytherapy software [4]) work under the assumption that all seeds are aligned with the CT axis [as shown in
Fig. 2(c)]. However, the American Association of Physicists
in Medicine recommends to determine the 3-D dose distribution of brachytherapy seeds based on real seed positions and

orientations [3]. A related clinical question is: “Does taking
into account real seed orientation induce significant differences
in dose distribution of brachytherapy treatment?.” The Dorgipro
project we participate in aims to answer this question by comparing the distributed dose calculated using standard brachytherapy
software (which assumes that the orientation is the planned orientation) to dose distribution obtained when considering the
3-D real seed orientation. This paper focuses on the imaging
aspects of this research project. The medical physics aspects are
described in a companion paper and will be briefly summarized
in Section V of this paper.
This paper presents the image processing method used to extract the seed positions and orientations, i.e., five parameters
(due to the cylindrical shape of the seeds). Our objective is

thus to develop a fully automatic software that is able to detect
seeds, separate groups of seeds—this stage is also referred to as
declustering in the literature—and accurately determine the 5-D
pose of seeds. In this study, we exploit the high intensity appearance of radioactive seeds in CT images for a solution based on
threshold and connected component segmentation [5]; we also
consider volume information for outlier removal and computation of the number of seeds in a union-seed. Three declustering
methods are considered for union-seed separation: the k-meansbased method [7] and a modified version of it and the Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) with an expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm [8]. Finally, the principal components analysis (PCA)
method [6] for orientation estimation is applied. Reference data
coming from the manual segmentation of seeds are used to validate the proposed method.
This paper is organized as follows. We begin by examining
the state-of-the-art in prostate brachytherapy seed detection in
medical images in Section II. In Section III, we present the
proposed solution for seed segmentation (see Section III-A),
union-seed separation (see Section III-B) and orientation estimation (see Section III-C) of the prostate brachytherapy seeds in
CT images. Experiments and evaluation are reported for datasets
generated from phantoms and 14 anonymous patients in Section IV. We then discuss the main contributions and potential
extensions of the proposed approach in Section V.
II. RELATED WORK
The accurate localization and orientation estimation of
brachytherapy seeds, including the ability to separate unionseeds, is a major challenge and active research field. Numerous

studies [9]–[25] have been published based on different prostate
image modalities, including magnetic resonance (MR), US, Xray and CT images. As previously mentioned, determining seed
positions is useful at different stages of the clinical protocol:
During the implantation US and/or X-ray images are necessary
for simply monitoring seed deposition or for intraoperative dynamic dosimetry [12], [22]–[24] and iterative correction in case
of inaccurate delivery; X-ray images are also used immediately
after the implantation for recording purpose; finally, CT data are
most often used after one month for dose evaluation. MRI can
also be used postoperatively alone or in combination with CT.
These modalities have different advantages and drawbacks: US
is a nonradiating modality as compared to X-ray but seeds are
more difficult to detect in US due to resolution, noise and reflection artifacts. Whilst MRI is nonradiating, CT is more often used
for dosimetric planning and evaluation since it provides useful information about tissue radiological density. X-ray-based
modalities enhance seed visibility while US or MRI improve
the visibility of the prostate and other soft tissue. Clusters of
seeds visible in the images may arise either from an inaccurate delivery of loose seeds or from an occlusion of stranded
seeds in X-ray projections. These specificities have given birth
to a very large collection of methods. Whilst our approach is
for the detection of loose seeds in CT postoperative images we
give a brief overview of some of the developed methods, with
a summary in Table I. They are classified according to different
properties:
1) the three required abilities: segmentation, 3-D orientation
estimation and declustering,
2) the imaging modalities and dimensionality,
3) when they are used (intraoperative IO, immediate postoperative IPO or postoperative PO),
4) whether or not they use the planning information,
5) the type of seeds (stranded or loose—Palladium or Iodine), and

6) how they were evaluated (phantom study, clinical study).
Note that Table I does not contain data about commercial
software as there is very little information available, they effectively work as “black boxes.” To the best of our knowledge
no commerical software provides capabilities similar to the one
described in this paper.
Recent advances in X-ray images have been reported for position detection and declustering of prostate seeds: for example,
the partition division on multiple projections of C-arm fluoroscopic images [11], [16], the region-based segmentation implicit
active contour model [17], [18], the geometric analysis from the
graph matching problem [13] or the mathematical morphology
analysis [20]. However, these methods may require a sophisticated object-matching algorithm and/or calibration to deal with
the substantial distortion of seeds in fluoroscopic images; moreover the orientation of seeds was not considered.
The other modalities, US and MRI, have also received a lot
of attention in the last decade. For example, the appropriate
location estimation of seeds in a target volume of real-time MR
imaging [10] or in IRON images (inversion-recovery with onresonant water suppression) using the Laplacian of a Gaussian
technique for blob detection [15] was considered. Wei et al.
[12] segmented the seeds from the subtraction map between the
background and postimplant US images and then applied a PCA
method for orientation detection. Again, these methods do not
manage union-seeds and the orientation of the seeds and their
detection results are limited by the poor visualization of seeds
in US and MR images.
Other approaches are based on the coregistration of different image modalities. For instance, a series of methods [14],
[19], [22], [24], [25] propose a volume-to-volume and pointto-volume registration scheme of US images with the implants
reconstructed from fluoroscopy. Recently, Hu et al. [23] considered the prior knowledge of the US-to-CT transformation via
registration and the planning seed position to define an atlas of

regions of interest for seed detection. Union-seed separation was
considered, however there was no explicit mention concerning
the management of seed orientations in these approaches.
Many papers consider stranded seeds whose real orientation
is generally quite similar to the planned orientation, making
it possible to search for lines of seeds close to the planned
orientation. For instance, Chng et al. [21] estimated the seed
orientations from the tangent vector to the curve of a seed strand
identified in postimplant CT images at each seed position.
Because loose seeds enable the clinician to sculpt the dose to
the precise treatment constraints, our objective was to develop
a method allowing the use of these loose seeds. Thus, this study
addresses the development of an automatic image processing
solution for the segmentation, localization and orientation estimation of prostate seeds. Fig. 2(d) shows an illustration of the
expected result of the proposed method for the detection of seed
poses in the prostate from the analysis of CT scanner images.
III. METHODS
Fig. 4 shows a sketch of the proposed approach. The different steps of this method are further detailed in the following
sections, including:
1) 3-D object segmentation and classification for the detection of a set of seeds (single and union-seeds) in
Section A.
2) Union-seeds separation in Section B.
3) 3-D orientation estimation in Section C.
A. Seed Segmentation Using the Connected Object Labeling
Method and Seed Classification Using the k-Means Method

Fig. 5.

This section details the detection of a set of seed candidates
and their classification into three groups (outliers, single seeds
and union-seeds) (see Fig. 5). Brachytherapy seeds are small
metallic cylinders (typically about 1-mm diameter for 5-mm
length) and appear as high intensity objects. They may produce
local artifacts obscuring neighboring tissues. Numerous methods have been developed to segment such small objects in a
gray level image including some region-based methods such as
watershed transformation [26], [27] and level sets [28], [29].
However, these methods require user input by positioning initial seeds or shapes. We choose to use a priori knowledge about
Hounsfield values in CT images [30], as well as volume information about the seeds in order to limit user interaction.

For instance, the voxel intensities of each type of material in
the CT images processed in this study are [min, 400] for phantom material and for patient soft tissues, [0, 1350] for bones
and [500, max] for seeds. Here, a threshold-based segmentation
method, namely connected component labeling [5] with only
an intensity threshold parameter t, is considered to exploit this
information for the detection of individual objects in the images.
We first threshold the original volume with the threshold parameter t, then each connected component (using 26-connectivity)
is assigned a label i and ordered by its size. The location of each
component is determined as its center of mass ci .
It is evident that the choice of the intensity threshold t is
a key issue. It can be heuristically set based on the image

characteristics and on the physical characteristics of the X-ray
absorption of the seeds (see Section IV). Moreover, the proposed method minimizes its influence on the results. Indeed, as
the choice of the threshold affects the volume of the obtained
connected component, no absolute volume is used, but the relative volumes of the components are compared to each other.
Fig. 6 shows an example of connected components detected in
the CT image of a patient, for a given threshold. The detected
objects in CT images of patients are divided into four types,
including: single seeds, union-seeds, bones and noise.
Comparing the volumes of the detected components to the
real volume of the seeds allows the first coarse classification of
the objects detected in the images. Let us denote by Vreal = πr2 l
the real volume of a radioactive seed, where r is the radius and
l the length of seed. The next step aims at suppressing large and
small objects as compared to Vreal . In practice, the pelvic bones
are very large components (with volumes more than 100 times
larger than the real volume Vreal ). Conversely, noise is composed
of tiny components (with volumes smaller than a third of Vreal ).
The other components are kept as candidate seeds with two
types: single seeds and union-seeds. In practice up to four or
five seeds can be included in a union-seed; however, generally
only two seeds are grouped. Determining the number of seeds in
a union-seed requires an estimation of the seed volume observed
in the CT exam; this volume clearly depends on the threshold t.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that single seeds
outnumber union-seeds in the remaining candidates (connected
components). Indeed, even if union-seeds often appear in loose
seed insertions, despite care taken by the clinician, they remain
exceptions and most seeds are placed with a reasonable distance
between them. We thus investigated the use of an unsupervised
partitioning method, k-means clustering [7] to separate the candidate seeds into k groups based on volume analysis. As mentioned, most detected components correspond to the cluster of
single seeds; we therefore decided to add two other clusters for
smaller (if any) and larger objects (in particular including unions
seeds); thus, we set k = 3. Fig. 7 shows an example of k-means
clustering on the volume of seed candidates detected in the CT
image of a real patient with 85 radioactive seeds implanted.

Fig. 7. Example of the result of the k-means method applied to the volume
histogram of connected components detected in CT13 image (see Section IV).
66 components are assigned to three clusters (represented by blue, green, red
circle points). The red square points correspond to the mean volume of each
cluster. Here, the largest cluster with 54 members is considered as the cluster of
single seeds.

The detail of the general k-means method is as follows: We
first randomly select k points as the initial cluster centroids.
Then, each candidate is assigned to the closest centroid of k
clusters based on volume information. We iterate this process
until stability is reached. The k-means algorithm shows its computational simplicity in many classification applications. However, the resulting clusters strongly depend on the selection of
the initial centroids. To improve the classification of seeds, the
three initial centroids of clusters are defined as: the minimum,
mean and maximum volume of the detected candidate components. At the end of the process, the largest cluster is selected
as the set of single seeds with average volume Vm ean computed
from the cluster. This value of Vm ean is considered as the observed volume of a seed in the image given by the threshold
t. This is a very important element to make the method more
robust with respect to the choice of t. The final classification of
the components is based on the comparison of their volume to
Vm ean . The number of seeds corresponding to each candidate is
calculated (rounded to the nearest integer value) as follows:
ns = Vcom p onent /Vm ean

(1)

where Vcom p onent is the volume of the candidate component. At
the end of this process, components are classified as follows:
1) ns = 0: The component is considered as an outlier and
removed;
2) ns = 1: The component is considered as a single seed;
3) ns > 1: The component is considered as a union-seed
composed of ns seeds.
Declustering the union-seeds will be necessary before pose
determination; it will be presented in the next section.
B. Union-Seed Separation
Considering the set of voxels of each union-seed detected by
the connected component labeling and the number of seeds ns
grouped in this union-seed [see (1)], this second step aims at
separating union-seeds using three unsupervised learning procedures: a k-means, a modified version named k-means-FS and

a GMM method. Fig. 8 shows the detail of this step. These three
methods enable handling cases that none alone can treat properly. The k-means clustering method is again used for the voxel
locations of each union-seed to separate it. Here, k is given
for each union-seed by the computed number ns [in (1)] and
the method groups voxels based on their proximity in terms of
position. However, the resulting seed clusters of k-means also
depend on the selection of the initial centroids and on the size
and shape differences between the regions shared in the clusters. In practice, the separation of a straight union-seed [see
Fig. 9(a)] is easily achieved by this classical k-mean method. In
contrast, the inaccuracies of this method occur when trying to
separate groups of parallel seeds [see Fig. 9(b)] or groups of four
or five seeds that are closely spaced [see Fig. 9(c)]. Hence, we
introduce two other methods to improve the separation of unionseeds. The first method consists in choosing the initial cluster of
the k-means algorithm by exploiting the orientation information
given by the PCA method (denoted k-means-for-seeds); it is intended to more robustly separate groups of parallel seeds. The
second method makes use of the GMM with the EM algorithm
[8] for better processing of complex groups of seeds.
1) Introducing the k-Means-for-Seeds Method: We define the
k-means-for-seeds (k-means-FS) method as follows: First, two
main directions {v1 ,v2 } of the union-seeds are estimated using
the PCA method (see Section III-C). Then, (ns – 1) parallel
planes are defined by the main direction v1 of the union-seeds
and the distance d = λ2 /ns between them [see Fig. 9(b)], where
λ2 is the second eigenvalue of the covariance matrix C of the
union-seed. These parallel planes divide the union-seed space
into ns partitions. Finally, we apply the k-means clustering algorithm with the initial cluster centers that are the centroids of
these ns partitions. In practice, this method presents its strength
in solving the problem of parallel seeds. Fig. 10 shows an exam-

a parallel union-seed separation. Note that the seeds displayed
in Figs. 10 and 11 are the results with their pose information
estimated using the PCA method.
2) Using the GMM and the EM Algorithm: In some cases,
the k-means-FS method does not give optimal results; thus,
we also consider a GMM in order to improve the clustering
of complicated union-seeds containing four or five seeds [see
Fig. 9(c)]. Each cluster of the GMM is generated by initially
choosing a cluster and then drawing from that cluster’s Gaussian
distribution (with means μi and covariance Ci ). The probability
given in a mixture of k Gaussians is given by

In this maximum likelihood problem, we try to find a set
of parameters θ that maximizes L(θ|X) using the standard EM
algorithm [8]. This algorithm works as follows: We initialize an
estimation of a set of Gaussian parameters θ. Here, the means μi
are obtained by the k-means algorithm, the covariance matrices
Ci are calculated from the distance to the nearest cluster of kmeans and all Gaussian weights wi are equally likely. At each
iteration of the EM algorithm, we compute the expected values
of the unknown data given the observed data and the current
model parameters in the expectation (E) step. The maximization
(M) step involves optimizing and updating the parameters to be
those with maximum likelihood. It can be shown that the loglikelihood was improved at each such iteration. This process is
stopped if a local maximum has been reached or some stopping
criterion is met, e.g., the default number of iterations. Fig. 11
shows an example of the seed separation improvement using
the GMM method compared to the k-mean-based method when
applied to a complex union-seed with four closely spaced seeds.
3) Selection of the Best Separation Method: In order to
achieve robustness, for each union-seed, we run each of the
three methods: the classical k-mean method with different random selections of the initial centroid clusters, the k-means-forseeds method and the GMM with EM algorithm. For each of
the methods, the cylindrical shapes corresponding to the model
of the seeds are positioned as computed. For each solution, the
sum of the number of voxels common between these cylindrical
shapes and the union-seed detected in the image is calculated.
The solution with the largest common volume is selected as the
best one.
In our clinical experiments reported in Table IV of Section
IV-C, 116 union-seeds in 14 patients were achieved. Among
them the best solution was found for 30 cases (25,9%) using the
k-means-for-seeds method, 18 cases (15,5%) using the GMM

method and 68 other cases (58,6%) using the classical k-means
method.
The obtained single seeds are then processed in order to compute their orientation as described in Section III-C.
C. Orientation Estimation Using the PCA Method
In this third step, we aim to estimate the orientation of each
3-D object detected by the connected component labeling or
union-seeds declustering. Numerous approaches have been proposed to estimate the 3-D object orientation in point clouds.
Among the most popular, the 3-D Hough transform [31]–[33]
focuses on the definition of the 3-D Hough space of each point
[see Fig. 12(a)]. The computational complexity is a major drawback of the Hough transform approximated by O(sp-1 n), where
n is the number of points, p is the number of parameters and s
is the number of samples along one Hough dimension. Another
category of 3-D orientation estimation is based on finding minimal enclosing boxes [34], [35]. Approximate minimum-volume
bounding box methods [see Fig. 12(b)] were shown to be particularly efficient with a complexity of O(n+1/ε4.5 ) compared to
the Hough transform approaches, where ε is the approximation
parameter. Such minimum bounding box models are however
not well-suited to our problem because they require a heuristic
parameter ε for grid search of the bounding box. This parameter
ε has no physical meaning related to the CT image acquisition.
In this study, we focused on a solution for 3-D orientation
estimation that would improve both aspects, by investigating
the PCA method [6]. The PCA method is the simplest and most
robust mathematical procedure for compressing and extracting
the description of a set of correlated observations by rejecting
low variance features. Considering p-dimensional feature vectors (in our case, 3-D), the PCA method is the projection of this

data onto q principal components. The first principal component
v1 is the feature space along which projections have the largest
eigenvalue λ1 of the covariance matrix C of the point cloud.
This is chosen as the orientation of the object [see Fig. 12(c)].
The second principal component v2 is the direction which maximizes the variance among all directions orthogonal to the first
one. The second direction v2 is exploited for the separation step
of union-seeds.
IV. EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION
A. Experimental Setup
As mentioned in Section II, various methods have been developed for different types of seeds. In Europe, the most frequently used isotope for permanent prostate seed implantation is
Iodine-125 (see the edition 2011 of Radiotherapy in Practice—
Brachytherapy [36]). That is why we focused on such type of
seeds. The validation of the proposed method, described in this
section, was done using CT images of brachytherapy seeds implanted into: 1) two specially created phantoms and 2) data from
14 real patients provided by the Grenoble University Hospital.
1) Radioactive Iodine-125 Seed: The clinical team of the
Grenoble University Hospital uses BEBIG IsoSeed I-125 seeds.
A seed is made of a cylindrical-shaped ceramic material, saturated with radioactive Iodine-125 compound and a gold marker
located in the center, all enclosed by a laser-sealed titanium tube.
The outer physical dimensions of the seed are l = 4.5 ± 0.2 mm
length and r = 0.4 ± 0.02 mm external radius. The Iodine-125
isotope emits photons at a maximum energy of 35 keV and has a
half-life of 59.46 days. This information is provided by the manufacturer [37]. Note that, the Iodine-125 was taken off for the
case of phantom to avoid the risk of radioactive contamination.
2) CT Images: The 3-D CT images were obtained using a GE
Lightspeed RT16 scanner with the default X-ray tube parameters: 120 kVp, 380–440 mA·s. The slice thickness was 0.625 mm
with 16 frames/s for each slice. The image reconstruction matrices were 512 × 512 archived in DICOM 3.0 format with 16-bit
gray-level intensities. These acquisition parameters were experimentally determined by the medical physicists using phantoms
so that the seeds could be seen on three to five slices [39].
3) Evaluation: In this paper, the evaluation of the proposed
approach is given in three terms: location and orientation detection performance and calculation time. A fully automatic
software based on the proposed solution was built on the opensource framework CamiTK [38] (using C++ with VTK and
ITK libraries). This software also provides some postprocessing tools to verify seed by seed in case of errors or inaccuracy.
The user can modify the seed position to better fit the image data;
this manually edited seed location is the reference information
to which the automatic detection is compared.
For this, we used the Euclidean distance between their centroids c and cr ef and the dot product of their orientation vectors
v and vr ef [see (4)].

Δd is expressed in mm, and Δθ is in degrees. Here, the time
evaluation is on a computer of 3.4-GHz Intel Core i7-2600 CPU.
B. Phantoms
The medical physicists of the clinical team created two phantoms (see Fig. 13) wherein the seeds were precisely positioned
with different orientations on the surface of the slab. Both phantoms had the same physical dimensions of 9 × 9 × 0.5 cm3 . The
reference position of the seeds in the phantom based on manual
detection was also provided for each case.
1) Single Seed in a Slab Phantom: The first phantom [cf.,
Fig. 13(a)] that we considered had a single seed located in
certain “predefined” orientations to evaluate the pose detection
of the proposed method. The 3-D image size of this phantom is
512 × 512 × 41 and the voxel size is 0.199 × 0.199 × 0.625
mm3 . We created 11 orientation cases for this phantom. Fig. 14
illustrates the different orientations of the seeds positioned in
this phantom.
Table II shows the values of the reference orientations and
the comparison between the results of the proposed method
and the reference with respect to orientation Δθ and distance
Δd when using an intensity threshold of t = 1500. With this
value, the greatest Δθ orientation error of 1.69° is observed for
the case (i) (for about 70°) and the other cases are equal to or
smaller than 0.83°. The best detection was obtained with the

reference orientation close to 0° (seed perpendicular to the CT
acquisition plane) where Δθ = 0.2◦ and Δd = 0.02 mm. Additionally, to investigate the dependence of the proposed method
to the choice of t, we also ran this experiment with ten choices
of t in an interval of [800, 1700]. The mean value and the standard deviation of the orientation error are Δθ = 0.96◦ ± 0.4.
The mean value and standard deviation of the distance error are
Δd = 0.08 ± 0.04 mm.
2) Multiple Seeds in a Multislab Phantom: We also report a
second experiment about the detection of 73 seeds implanted
in a more complex phantom composed of nine slabs (Plastic water-LR, Medi-Test, Saclay, France). The placements of
the seeds look more similar to what could be a real implantation for a patient. Nine same size slabs are pressed together
by four screws. Holes were drilled into the slabs to place the
radioactive seeds in different orientations. Fig. 13(b) shows
the design of the central slab of the phantom. The 3-D image size of this phantom is 512 × 512 × 73 and the voxel
size is 0.217 × 0.217 × 0.625 mm3 . In this experiment, we
have tested the proposed method with ten choices of t in the
interval of [800, 1700]. Fig. 15 shows the distribution of the 73
seeds detected in a CT image when using the intensity threshold
t = 1500.
Compared to the reference data, the mean and standard
deviation of the orientation error are Δθ = 1.32◦ ± 0.9; the
mean and standard deviation of the position error is Δd =
0.13 ± 0.07 mm for ten choices of the intensity threshold t.
Some seeds are perfectly located (Δθ = 0◦ , Δd = 0mm), e.g.,
the seeds positioned vertically in the central slab when using an
intensity threshold of t = 1500. In contrast, the most inaccurate

C. Patient Experiment
We report 14 cases of radioactive seed detection on real patient images. The CT scanner images were taken one month after
the implantation procedure in the Grenoble University Hospital.
Data were anonymized before export and processing. Table IV
details the information of the scanner images and the number of
seeds implanted in the planning of the brachytherapy treatment.
It should be reminded that, some seeds may migrate, therefore
the number of detected seeds may be different even if perfectly
successful.
In this experiment, we ran the proposed method with different
values of the intensity threshold t for all 14 patient cases. Again,
the choice of the intensity threshold t was based on the HU
values of each material in the CT images: In these data, soft
tissues were in the range [min, 400], bones were in [0, 1350] and
seeds were in [500, max]. We considered the intensity threshold
in the interval of [1350, 2000] with a step of 100 (beginning
with 1400).
Seed detection errors, which we will call “false detections”
(FD), can be classified into three categories as follows:
1) FD1: the undetected seeds because of their migration out
of the imaged region or because of the limitations of the
method (false negative).
2) FD2: the noisy objects detected in image such as calcifications that can be recognized as potential seeds if their
intensity and volume are compatible with the seeds or
union-seeds characteristics (false positive).
3) FD3: correspond to the errors due to the incorrect separation of union seeds; that may be due to a wrong estimated
number of seeds.
The sum of all types of FD, when using the proposed method
with different values of the intensity threshold t in the range
[1350, 2000], is plotted in Fig. 16. Here, the best results were
obtained with the thresholds t = 1500 or 1600 where the sum of

FD are minimum for all 14 patient cases. When a low threshold
t (e.g., t = 1350) is chosen, FD2 increases with extra noise. In
contrast, the number of wrongly separated seeds (FD3) is bigger
when a high threshold t (e.g., t = 1900) is used; this is because
of the loss of shape information of the seeds. The total number
of FD, summed from the 14 cases, for each choice of threshold
t is given in Table III.
From this experimental result, we suggest choosing the intensity threshold in Hounsfield Units in [1500, 1700], for which
the radioactive seeds can be most successfully separated from
the other material.
Table IV details the results obtained for the 14 prostate
cases using the proposed method with an intensity threshold
of t = 1500. Compared to the reference data, the maximum
(respectively minimum) orientation error Δθ is 3.180° ± 0.9
(resp. 0.680° ± 0.2) and the maximum (resp. minimum) distance error Δd is 0.50 ± 0.16 mm (resp. 0.15 ± 0.09 mm). The
number of FD is also reported in detail for each case. Compared
to the number of implanted seeds, eight seeds in total could
not be found (FD1) in CT3, CT5, CT7, CT8 and CT9 images.
Some existing objects of FD2 type were also detected in CT3
(cf., Fig. 17), CT5, CT7, CT10 and CT11. Considering FD3
FDs (wrong union-seed separation), two groups of four real implanted seeds were detected as union-seed of five seeds; this
occurs in CT3 and CT5 images.
Fig. 18 also shows the detail of each type of FD for a single
patient (CT14) and for different values of the threshold t. The
mean calculation time of the proposed method was 9.7 s over
126 runs for 14 patient cases with different intensity thresholds
t. It is therefore a very fast solution when compared to the
half day that was required for the careful manual segmentation
of the reference data or compared to the average 30 min for
conventional postprocessing of images treated by our clinical
team after detection of seeds with their commercial system.
Fig. 19 shows some examples of the seeds detected in patients.
V. DISCUSSION
In this study, an efficient and fast approach for the pose estimation of brachytherapy seeds in CT images has been presented.
The key methods used in this study may be summarized as follows:
1) Classification of detected objects based on a priori intensity and volume information.
2) Estimation of 3-D objects based on the extraction of principal components.
3) Separation of groups of seeds using k-means, a modified
k-means clustering method and GMM method with an
EM algorithm.

2021

4) Individual seed orientation estimation using the PCA
method.
The results herein were quickly obtained with only small
differences compared to the reference data for both phantoms
and patients. For example, the proposed method achieves the
orientation error Δθ = 0.96◦ ± 0.4, the distance error Δd =
0.08 ± 0.04 mm and the calculation time 0.67 s ± 0.3 for a
phantom in Section IV-B1. These evaluation values can be compared to Δθ = 2◦ , Δd = 0.3 mm and calculation time 9 s of
a previous related work for CT images (Chng’s method [21]).
This comparison in terms of detection performance and calculation time pointed out the relevance of our contributions.
However, these comparisons must be interpreted carefully since
the phantoms and computer systems were different.
In clinical practice, the role of the human operator can be limited to a verification task and modifications for misdetections if
any. In fact, the migrated seeds (FD type: FD1) always lead to a
significant uncertainty in the postimplant dosimetry calculation.
The proposed method described in this paper works without the
prior knowledge about the number of implanted seeds. Therefore, finding less seeds than expected by the planning should
warn the operator about possible migration or misdetections.
On the other hand, the false positive detections (FD2) are often
due to calcifications very frequent in the prostate gland of men
with benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostate cancer. The distinction between calcifications and brachytherapy seeds may be
still a challenging task even for a very skilled clinician. Thus,
the verification by the clinician in this case is always necessary
but may not be sufficient.
The advantage of the clustering approaches (k-means or
GMM) used in this study for the separation of union-seeds
is their small computational complexity compared to other approaches such as RANSAC [40] or Hough transform [33]. However, there was still a few FDs due to inappropriate seed separation (here, FD3): less than 0.19% (see Table IV). Therefore, a
manual correction step may also be necessary. Some approaches
based on the morphology analysis or 3-D template matching
could be considered in the future to improve the performance
of this separation task. Overall of 1063 seeds implanted in 14
patient cases in Table IV, the false positive (FD2 + FD3) percentage of our approach is 1.03%. This value is lower compared
to the state-of-the-art methods reported in the Table II of the publication of San Filippo et al. [24], where [17] was 2.2%, [22],
[24] were 1.7%. These results open the door to accurate dose
calculation and procedure quality assessment. As already mentioned in the introduction, a dosimetry study has been launched
in parallel in our institution on a series of patients including the
14 patients of this paper [39]. Its aim is to evaluate the impact
of accurate pose evaluation onto dose distribution for prostate
brachytherapy treatment. It will be published separately but a
few elements may be summarized here. Compared to the ideal
axis of insertion, the seeds angular error are in average for the
1063 seeds of the 14 patients 0.81° ± 27.7 and 1.06° ± 21.1 in
spherical coordinates. As concerns the Dose Volume Histograms
no significant difference could be demonstrated between dose
evaluation using or not orientation information but our number
of patients was quite small. In a very recently published paper

[41] concerning a study using five fluoroscopic images and a CT
of 287 patients, the authors demonstrate small but significant
dose difference evaluated on organs at risks. In our much more
limited study we also exhibited significant local dose differences
that could have a clinical impact. A more extensive clinical study
is necessary to draw useful conclusions. In the context of this
study which aim was to evaluate a new method, man–machine
interaction has been restrained to what was strictly necessary. It

however, we kept it because the visualization in this figure was easier than when
FDs are in the middle of the other seeds.

is clear that the routine use of the approach would require special
care for assisting the operator in the verification task, in particular we envision to orient his/her screening toward suspicious
detections. Work remains to be done for scoring the detection.
In future work, the potential of an automatic choice of an
optimal intensity threshold will be further explored from the
analysis of quantitative and geometric information of FDs. Robust solutions of seed localization for different prostate image
modalities such as US or image registration for improved evaluation with respect to the anatomy of patient are also among the
key issues that should be addressed.
VI. CONCLUSION
This paper has presented an automatic, accurate, robust and
fast approach for the automatic localization of brachytherapy
loose Iodine-125 seeds in CT postoperative images. It was evaluated on phantom and patient data. The key originalities of
this study lie in the ability to separate groups of seeds and

to determine their orientation for improved evaluation of dose
distribution to the patient. Based on intensity information and
observed volume of the detected objects the method was able
to accurate determine the 5-D pose of seeds with very few FDs.
Further work both concerns technical aspects and a larger clinical evaluation.
