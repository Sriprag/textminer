Identification of Type 2 Diabetes Risk Factors Using
Phenotypes Consisting of Anthropometry and
Triglycerides based on Machine Learning
Bum Ju Lee and Jong Yeol Kim

Abstract—The hypertriglyceridemic waist (HW) phenotype is
strongly associated with type 2 diabetes; however, to date, no study
has assessed the predictive power of phenotypes based on individual anthropometric measurements and triglyceride (TG) levels.
The aims of the present study were to assess the association between the HW phenotype and type 2 diabetes in Korean adults and
to evaluate the predictive power of various phenotypes consisting
of combinations of individual anthropometric measurements and
TG levels. Between November 2006 and August 2013, 11 937 subjects participated in this retrospective cross-sectional study. We
measured fasting plasma glucose and TG levels and performed
anthropometric measurements. We employed binary logistic regression (LR) to examine statistically significant differences between normal subjects and those with type 2 diabetes using HW
and individual anthropometric measurements. For more reliable
prediction results, two machine learning algorithms, naive Bayes
(NB) and LR, were used to evaluate the predictive power of various phenotypes. All prediction experiments were performed using
a tenfold cross validation method. Among all of the variables, the
presence of HW was most strongly associated with type 2 diabetes
(p < 0.001, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.07 [95% CI, 1.72–2.49]
in men; p < 0.001, adjusted OR = 2.09 [1.79–2.45] in women).
When comparing waist circumference (WC) and TG levels as components of the HW phenotype, the association between WC and
type 2 diabetes was greater than the association between TG and
type 2 diabetes. The phenotypes tended to have higher predictive
power in women than in men. Among the phenotypes, the best
predictors of type 2 diabetes were waist-to-hip ratio + TG in men
(AUC by NB = 0.653, AUC by LR = 0.661) and rib-to-hip ratio +
TG in women (AUC by NB = 0.73, AUC by LR = 0.735). Although
the presence of HW demonstrated the strongest association with
type 2 diabetes, the predictive power of the combined measurements of the actual WC and TG values may not be the best manner
of predicting type 2 diabetes. Our findings may provide clinical information concerning the development of clinical decision support
systems for the initial screening of type 2 diabetes.
Index Terms—Anthropometric measurements, data mining, hypertriglyceridemic waist (HW) phenotype, machine learning, predictor, triglycerides (TG), type 2 diabetes.

I. INTRODUCTION
UMEROUS epidemiological and public health studies
regarding the associations between anthropometric measurements and type 2 diabetes have been conducted. These studies have attempted to identify anthropometric measurements that
can better predict type 2 diabetes based on ethnicity, gender,
and nationality. Anthropometric measurements, such as waist
circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height
ratio (WHtR), and body mass index (BMI), have been reported
to be strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, and have demonstrated good predictive power in Canada [1], China [2], [3],
Mexico [4], France [5], the United States [6], Jamaica [7], Vietnam [8], Hong Kong [9], Australia [10], Korea [11], and multiethnic cohorts [12]. However, the majority of these studies
focused on the analysis of only one or several anthropometric
measurements and risk factors suitable for the identification of
type 2 diabetes.
Recently, a large number of studies exploring the effects and
prevalence of the hypertriglyceridemic waist (HW) phenotype,
which consists of triglyceride (TG) levels and WC, have been
conducted, revealing that the HW phenotype was strongly associated with type 2 diabetes [13]–[15], cardiovascular disease
[16]–[18], and metabolic syndrome [19]–[25]. These studies
also commonly suggested that the concurrent use of WC and
TG levels could be useful in prevalence studies of type 2 diabetes and reported better results compared to the use of WC
or TG levels alone. In a previous study, LaMonte et al. [22]
indicated that HW could be used as a sensitive, simple, and
inexpensive predictor in asymptomatic female subjects with diabetes risk profiles and coronary heart disease because women
with HW tend to have a higher risk for coronary heart disease than women without HW. Using the criteria established
by the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) and the International Diabetes
Federation (IDF), Blackburn et al. [21] compared the ability of
HW to identify subjects with cardiometabolic risk factors and
found that HW may have a similar discriminative power to the
NCEP-ATP III and IDF criteria, which may enable the use of
HW as a primary screening tool to detect subjects with higher
cardiometabolic risks.
These previous studies have indicated that the HW phenotype is a critical predictor of type 2 diabetes. However, no study
has assessed the predictive power of using various phenotypes
consisting of individual anthropometric measurements and TG
levels and a phenotype that uses the actual TG and WC values as
components of the HW phenotype. The objective of the present

study was to assess the association between the HW phenotype and type 2 diabetes and evaluate the predictive power of
many phenotypes with combinations of individual anthropometric measurements and TG levels. To our knowledge, this is
the first study to analyze the predictive powers of phenotypes
consisting of TG levels and other anthropometric indices in
identifying type 2 diabetes in Korean adults.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Study Population
A total of 11 937 subjects (4906 males and 7031 females) 31–
80 years of age participated in this retrospective cross-sectional
study. All subjects were recruited between November 2006
and August 2013 from hospitals in Ansan, Anseong, and other
cities in the Korea. All of the data in the present study were
obtained from the Korean Health and Genome Epidemiology
Study database. Written informed consent was obtained from
all participants, and the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine
Institutional Review Board approved the study.
B. Measurement
The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels and TG levels of all
subjects were measured for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and
hypertriglyceridemia. All subjects were asked to fast for at least
8 h, and blood samples were subsequently drawn to analyze
plasma glucose and TGs (ADVIA 1800, Siemens, USA).
The anthropometric measurements were obtained by welltrained observers using standardized protocols. The heights and
weights of the participants were measured to the nearest 0.1 cm
and 0.1 kg, respectively, (LG-150; G Tech International Co.,
Ltd., Uijeongbu, Republic of Korea), with lightweight clothing and without shoes. We measured the circumferences of the
forehead, neck, axilla, chest, rib, waist, pelvis, and hip using
nonelastic tape. For example, accurate positions of forehead
and chest measurements are at the levels of the glabella and
occiput and at the levels of the left and right nipples [11], [26].
Additionally, we calculated the ratios between measurements
that are commonly used in anthropometry and epidemiology:
The exact WHR, WHtR, neck-to-hip ratio (Neck_Hip), rib-tohip ratio (Rib_Hip), forehead-to-neck ratio (Forehead_Neck),
forehead-to-waist ratio (Forehead_Waist), forehead-to-rib ratio
(Forehead_Rib), and BMI. Detailed measurement positions and
descriptions were described in [11] and [26].
C. Definitions
When diagnosing type 2 diabetes in this study, we used the
criteria of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [27] and the 1990 World Health Organization report [28].
In detail, subjects with FPG > 110 mg/dl and/or a physician’s
diagnosis were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
To diagnose subjects with the HW phenotype, we considered
recent studies that have defined the HW phenotype. Male subjects with TG ࣙ 2.0 mmol/L (177 mg/dl) and WC ࣙ 90 cm [29]–
[32] and female subjects with TG ࣙ 1.5 mmol/L (133 mg/dl) and
WC ࣙ 85 cm [31], [33]–[35] were determined to have the HW

phenotype. Male subjects with TG < 2.0 mmol/L (177 mg/dl)
and/or WC < 90 cm and female subjects with TG < 1.5 mmol/L
(133 mg/dl) and/or WC < 85 cm were defined as normal subjects. Table I lists the basic patient characteristics and brief
descriptions. Among the men, 3849 had type 2 diabetes and
1057 were normal subjects; among the women, 6103 had type
2 diabetes and 928 were normal subjects.
D. Experimental Configuration
All statistical analyses and predictive power assessments were
conducted using SPSS 19 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) and the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis
data mining tool [36].
Our methodologies focused on two different analyses: statistical analysis of the association between HW phenotype, individual measurements, and type 2 diabetes, and analysis of the
predictive powers of individual measurements and various phenotypes. Previous similar studies have only focused on statistical
analysis of the association between HW phenotype and type 2
diabetes [13]–[15], [29], [37]–[39]. However, these studies only
used the specific range of WC and TG values to diagnosis HW
phenotype. A study that is based on the specific range of TG and
WC cannot find the better phenotype consisting of individual
measurements and TG. We should know the predictive power
of individual measurements and phenotypes to find the better
predictor of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we used two machine
learning algorithms to reveal the predictive power of all phenotypes and measurements. Specifically, in the HW phenotype and
single measurements, a statistical evaluation of the significant
differences between the normal individuals and those with type
2 diabetes was performed using binary logistic regression (LR)
after standardization was applied to the data (odds ratios [OR]
and 95% confidence intervals [CI]). To compare the predictive
powers of all phenotypes (single anthropometric measurements
and TG levels, individual anthropometric measurements, and
TG levels) in the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, we used two machine learning algorithms, the naive Bayes (NB) algorithm and
LR, in order to obtain more reliable and trustworthy results. We
selected NB and LR because in preexperiments using several
machine learning algorithms, these two machine learning algorithms showed the best predictive power; in addition, NB and
LR are widely used for statistical analysis in medical studies
because of their unique characteristics.
Two machine learning algorithms (i.e., NB and LR) are generally used to solve association, prediction, or classification problems in medial and epidemiological studies. However, a conceptual problem with NB relates to conditional independence; all
features (variables) are independent, given the value of the response variable (class label). In real-world research, conditional
independence assumption was unsuitable for such applications
[40]. Briefly, the NB classifier estimates P (Y |X) using joint
probability P (X, Y ) = P (Y )P (X|Y ) from training samples,
given random variables X and Y; the weights of each feature are
fitted independently (i.e., the generative classifier) [40]–[42].
The number of normal subject is greater than the number of
subjects with type 2 diabetes (an unbalanced-class problem).

p = 0.0015 and ‡ p = <0.0001 between normal subjects and subjects with diabetes in men, ∗ p = <0.0001 between normal subjects and subjects
with diabetes in women.

Generally, classes with few subjects are more difficult to predict than those with numerous subjects [11], [26], [43]–[46].
However, in this study, we used an original dataset. We did not
use a cost-sensitive sampling method because the characteristics of an original dataset are generally observed in medical or
epidemiological studies.
In the assessment of predictive power, the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as the
primary criterion. All of the prediction experiments for the predictive power measurements were performed using a tenfold
cross validation.
III. RESULTS
A. Association of Type 2 Diabetes With the HW Phenotype
and Individual Measurements
In the present study, there were 431 male subjects with the
HW phenotype in the normal group and 214 in the diabetes
group; there were 1099 female subjects with the HW phenotype
in the normal group and 355 in the diabetes group. In terms of
anthropometry, 14 measurements were used to predict type 2
diabetes, and all variables showed statistically significant difference between the normal group and the diabetes group for
men and women, except for DBP in men (p = <0.0001).
Tables II and III list the results of the associations of type
2 diabetes with HW and individual anthropometric measurements in men and women. In men, when we considered the
association between type 2 diabetes and HW and anthropometric indices, the presence of the HW phenotype displayed the
strongest association with type 2 diabetes (p < 0.001, OR =
2.01 [95% CI, 1.68–2.41], adjusted OR = 2.07 [1.72–2.49]).

[1.28–1.47]). These associations were not substantially altered
after adjusting for age and region.
In women, among all of the variables, the presence of the HW
phenotype was most strongly associated with type 2 diabetes
(p < 0.001, OR = 2.83 [2.44–3.28], adjusted OR = 2.09 [1.79–
2.45]). Among the individual indices, Rib_Hip (p = < 0.001,

Forehead_Rib (p = <0.001, OR = 0.44 [0.41–0.48], adjusted
OR = 0.53 [0.48–0.58]) were the most strongly associated with
type 2 diabetes, with the exception of the presence of the HW
phenotype. These associations were not substantially altered
even after adjusting for site and age.
B. Comparison of the Predictive Powers of the Phenotypes
Tables IV and V list the comparative predictive powers of the
individual anthropometric measurements and phenotypes using
combinations of single measurements and TG levels in men and
women. When comparing the predictive power of each of the
anthropometric indices for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in
men, WHR (AUC by NB = 0.647, AUC by LR = 0.648) had the
best predictive power, but this power was only slightly higher
than that of RibC, Rib_Hip, and Forehead_Rib. Regarding the
predictive powers of either WC or TG levels, WC had a strong
predictive power (AUC = 0.63), whereas TG did not (AUC by
NB = 0.546, AUC by LR = 0.598). The WHR + TG phenotype
displayed the strongest predictive power for type 2 diabetes
among the phenotypes consisting of individual measurements
and TG levels (AUC by NB = 0.653, AUC by LR = 0.661).
In women, Rib_Hip was the best predictor of type 2 diabetes
among the indices (AUC = 0.72). When comparing WC and
TG as components of the HW phenotype, the predictive power
of WC (AUC = 0.672) for type 2 diabetes was superior to
that of TG (AUC by NB = 0.634, AUC by LR = 0.657). Among
all of the phenotypes, the Rib_Hip + TG phenotype was the best
indicator of type 2 diabetes (AUC by NB = 0.73, AUC by LR

= 0.735). Additionally, Forehead_Rib + TG, RibC + TG, and
Waist_Hip + TG were useful phenotypes for predicting type 2
diabetes.
When predicting type 2 diabetes using the actual TG values
in addition to the measurement values, the addition of the TG
values to the single measurements resulted in little improvement
in the predictive power compared to the single measurements.
Although the presence of HW had the strongest association
with type 2 diabetes, the predictive power of the combined
measurements of WC and TG using their actual values (not the
presence of HW) was slightly lower than that of several other
phenotypes.
IV. DISCUSSION
The present study assessed the association between the HW
phenotype and type 2 diabetes and evaluated the predictive powers of combined anthropometric measurements and TG levels
in Korean adults. Our results indicated that among the variables
examined, the presence of the HW phenotype was the most
strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, even after adjusting for
site and age. The findings of the present study were in agreement
with those of previous studies, indicating that the presence of
the HW phenotype was strongly associated with type 2 diabetes
[14], [15], [29], [37]–[39]. Yu et al. [14] argued that Chinese
men and women with HW were at an increased risk of developing diabetes and hyperglycemia compared to subjects without
hypertriglyceridemia and/or abdominal obesity. Similarly, Du
et al. [15] documented that HW and the visceral adiposity index
were useful predictors of diabetes. Lemieux et al. [29] indicated
that HW was associated with coronary artery disease (CAD)
and type 2 diabetes and served as a useful and practical clinical
screening tool in patients with CAD and diabetes. Egeland et al.
[37] indicated that measurements of WC and TG levels were efficient indicators of diabetes in the Inuit people of the Canadian
Arctic and noted that using several metabolic syndrome criteria
to identify subjects with abnormalities was a time-consuming
task. Brisson et al. [38] argued that the combined use of WC and
TG levels in the first trimester of pregnancy in French–Canadian
white women could enhance the ability of an initial screening to
detect gestational diabetes. Amini et al. [39] documented that
men and women with HW tended to have diabetes and women
with HW tended to have an impaired glucose tolerance; they
also found that HW could be used to detect diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance during the initial stages. They revealed
that men with the HW phenotype had greater TG and cholesterol
levels and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels than
other groups of men without HW or men with either an enlarged
WC or elevated TG levels; women with HW had higher fasting
blood sugar levels.
The association between the HW phenotype and type 2 diabetes was stronger in women than in men, and phenotypes
consisting of each index and TG levels tended to have higher
predictive powers in women than in men. We hypothesize that
one of the reasons for this phenomenon is that the relationship between anthropometric indices and type 2 diabetes is
stronger in women than in men [11], [47]–[49]. For example,

Paek and Chun [47] investigated the association between type
2 diabetes and WC and BMI in Korean adults and revealed that
the type 2 diabetes predictive powers of WC and BMI were
higher in women than in men. Lee et al. [48] studied the association between WC, WHtR, WHR, and BMI and metabolic risks
in Korean women and men who participated in the healthy twin
study and found that the AUC values of four anthropometric indices in the prediction of high fasting glucose levels were greater
in women than in men. In addition, Lee et al. [11] carried out an
analysis of the predictive powers of 37 anthropometric indices in
identifying type 2 diabetes and reported that the majority of the
anthropometric indices had better predictive powers in women
than in men. Likewise, Ashwell et al. [49] conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of a total of 24 studies for women
and 22 studies for men in 18 different countries and reported
that the predictive powers of WHtR, WC, and BMI for diabetes
were stronger in women than in men. The findings of these
previous studies were consistent with the results of the present
study, indicating that the predictive powers of anthropometric

indices used to screen for type 2 diabetes are better in women
than in men.
Regarding WC and TG levels as two components of the HW
phenotype, WC was the more important component of the HW
phenotype because the association between WC and type 2 diabetes was higher than that of TG levels and type 2 diabetes; the
predictive power of WC was also stronger than that of TG levels
in both men and women. In addition, this study reported that
the association between the HW phenotype and type 2 diabetes
was stronger than that of WC or TG levels alone. This finding
was consistent with the results of previous studies [13], [47].
For example, Okosuna and Boltrib [13] noted that the HW phenotype was more strongly associated with type 2 diabetes than
either hypertriglyceridemia or increased WC. They also noted
racial and ethnic differences in the relationship between HW
and type 2 diabetes: The association between type 2 diabetes
and HW was much higher in black men and women than in
white men and women. Sam et al. [50] indicated that in nonHispanic white and non-Hispanic black subjects in Chicago,

44

WC alone did not predict diabetes in individuals with higher degrees of visceral fat accumulation, even in individuals with type
2 diabetes. They revealed that the relationship between HW and
coronary atherosclerosis may be associated with proatherogenic
lipoprotein changes related to HW. They also reported that the
combined use of fasting TG levels and WC was an accessible
and inexpensive tool that could be used to predict the degree of
visceral fat, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic risk.
In summary, we demonstrated that the presence of the HW
phenotype was the variable that was most strongly associated
with type 2 diabetes. The association between WC and type 2
diabetes was stronger than the association between TG levels
and type 2 diabetes. When examining the predictive powers of
WC and TG levels alone, WC was a good predictor of type
2 diabetes, whereas TG was not. When comparing the various
phenotypes (i.e., single measurements and TG levels), the best
phenotype for predicting type 2 diabetes differed according to
gender; WHR + TG in men and Rib_Hip + TG in women were
the best predictors of type 2 diabetes. The main contribution of
this study was that although the presence of the HW phenotype
was the variable most strongly associated with type 2 diabetes,
the predictive power of this phenotype, which consisted of the
actual TG and WC values, was slightly lower than that of the
other phenotypes. Therefore, the predictive power of the combined measurements of the actual WC and TG values may not
be the best method of predicting type 2 diabetes, and the best
phenotype for predicting type 2 diabetes differed according to
gender. When comparing our study to previous studies, the previous studies only documented the association of the HW phenotype with type 2 diabetes and the effect of the HW phenotype.
However, to date, an analysis of the predictive powers of phenotypes consisting of both individual anthropometric measurements and TG levels has not been conducted. To our knowledge,
the present study is the first to compare the predictive powers of
the combined measurements of each anthropometric index and
TG levels in type 2 diabetes. Our findings may provide clinical
information that can be used to develop clinical decision support
systems for the initial screening of type 2 diabetes.
Our findings have several limitations. The retrospective crosssectional design of this study does not allow us to establish a
cause-effect relationship. To predict type 2 diabetes, the proposed method in this study suggested that the actual TG and
WC values be used instead of the range of TG and WC values
and various phenotypes consisting of individual anthropometric measurements and TG. This method may easily be used in
experiments to identify the best phenotype or predictor of type
2 diabetes in various countries. However, the findings of this
study cannot be applied to other populations because the study
population included only Korean women and men. Among a single patient cohort, there can exist differences in socio-economic
status, race, gender, and nationality. For example, several ethnic groups or nationalities demonstrate different BMI or body
shape characteristics. In terms of HW phenotype, the WC criteria should differ by ethnic group or country. Some researchers
have suggested that normal WC or BMI ranges for both men
and women differ among Europeans or between Americans and
Asians [51]–[56]. To predict type 2 diabetes, we must find the

optimal cut-off value for each WC and TG based on the ROC
curves (AUC) for type 2 diabetes, considering the differences
related to nationality, gender, and ethnicity. We must identify
the value ranges for normal subjects and subjects with the HW
phenotype using the TG and WC cut-off values. Further studies
are needed to build and assess a generalized phenotype across
world populations.
