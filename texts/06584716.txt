Blind End-Member and Abundance Extraction for
Multispectral Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging
Microscopy Data

Abstract—This paper proposes a new blind end-member and
abundance extraction (BEAE) method for multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (m-FLIM) data. The chemometrical analysis relies on an iterative estimation of the fluorescence
decay end-members and their abundances. The proposed method
is based on a linear mixture model with positivity and sum-to-one
restrictions on the abundances and end-members to compensate
for signature variability. The synthesis procedure depends on a
quadratic optimization problem, which is solved by an alternating least-squares structure over convex sets. The BEAE strategy
only assumes that the number of components in the analyzed sample is known a spriori. The proposed method is first validated by
using synthetic m-FLIM datasets at 15, 20, and 25 dB signal-tonoise ratios. The samples simulate the mixed response of tissue
containing multiple fluorescent intensity decays. Furthermore, the
results were also validated with six m-FLIM datasets from fresh
postmortem human coronary atherosclerotic plaques. A quantitative evaluation of the BEAE was made against two popular techniques: minimum volume constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (MVC-NMF) and multivariate curve resolution-alternating
least-squares (MCR-ALS). Our proposed method (BEAE) was able
to provide more accurate estimations of the end-members: 0.32%
minimum relative error and 13.82% worst-case scenario, despite
different initial conditions in the iterative optimization procedure
and noise effect. Meanwhile, MVC-NMF and MCR-ALS presented
more variability in estimating the end-members: 0.35% and 0.34%
for minimum errors and 15.31% and 13.25% in the worst-case
scenarios, respectively. This tendency was also maintained for the
abundances, where BEAE obtained 0.05 as the minimum absolute
error and 0.12 in the worst-case scenario; MCR-ALS and MVCNMF achieved 0.04 and 0.06 for the minimum absolute errors,
and 0.15 and 0.17 under the worst-case conditions, respectively.
In addition, the average computation time was evaluated for the
synthetic datasets, where MVC-NMF achieved the fastest time,
followed by BEAE and finally MCR-ALS. Consequently, BEAE
improved MVC-NMF in convergence to a local optimal solution
and robustness against signal variability, and it is roughly 3.6 time
faster than MCR-ALS.

I. INTRODUCTION
EVERAL research groups around the world study options
for an effective method to perform minimal invasive characterization of living tissue [1]. Fluorescent dyes are a common
tool employed to label molecules within living systems, since
this technique allows their location and therefore a description of
their molecular environment, which could be useful for pathology detection and treatment monitoring in a noninvasive way
at low cost [2]. The estimation of the fluorescent components
and their fractional contributions is known in the literature as
the linear unmixing problem [3]. Previous approaches look to
achieve this objective by using synthetic dyers [4], [5], which
rely on invasive techniques for their application.
m-FLIM is a recently developed technique [6] which measures the simultaneous time-resolved fluorescence response at
different wavelength bands of the molecular content of a tissue
sample. Fig. 1 shows an endogenous m-FLIM measurement performed on a postmortem human coronary artery sample, where
the fluorescence emission was measured at three distinctive
wavelength bands (390 ± 20, 452 ± 22.5, and 550 ± 20 nm).
m-FLIM data take advantage of the autofluorescence decay
profiles to reduce the need for synthetic dyers, although its
main limitation is the similarity among the autofluorescence profiles or end-members from different molecules that build up the

390 ± 20, 452 ± 22.5, and 550 ± 20 nm.

Although these end-members are generated by different molecular components,
they present high overlapping among them.

tissue sample. Consequently, there is high overlapping between
the end-members in the recorded measurements. This effect is
illustrated in Fig. 2. Hence, advanced blind source separation
techniques are needed to effectively characterize the m-FLIM
samples [7], [8].
The linear unmixing problem is found in a large number of
applications such as remote sensing [9], [10], where techniques
such as nonnegative matrix factorization have been extensively
used. Most of the existing techniques rely on an optimization
characterization to solve the unmixing problem [9]. In fact, sev-

eral techniques are based on the fact that due to the linear mixture
model, end-members represent the vertices of an N -dimensional
simplex [11], where N is the number of components in the
mixture. Different strategies are employed to estimate these
vertices; for example, one approach searches for a minimumvolume simplex in order to fit the measured data [12], [13].
However, the resulting optimization strategy is nonlinear and
its convergence depends largely on the ICs. Another strategy
relies on the Bayesian estimation for joint end-member extraction and abundance estimation in hyperspectral imagery, where
a Gibbs sampler is proposed to reconstruct the posterior distributions [14]. However, the complexity of the resulting solution
could be a limiting factor for large data samples. Meanwhile,
in [7], a quadratic cost function is proposed which avoids the
estimation of the simplex volume for end-member extraction
in hyperspectral imagery, and has the advantage of a global
solution. In this context, this paper considers the quadratic formulation in [7], [15], and [16], and extends them by adding
new restrictions particularly of m-FLIM data for BEAE. The
mathematical derivations of the new methodology are included
in the paper, and the convergence of the BEAE algorithm is analytically demonstrated based on ALS. Synthetic data are used
to systematically evaluate the performance and robustness of
the BEAE, in comparison with two of the most common accepted techniques in the literature: MVC-NMF and MCR-ALS.
Finally, six m-FLIM datasets from fresh postmortem human
coronary atherosclerotic plaques are also employed to validate
our proposal.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The linear
mixture model for m-FLIM data and the notation used throughout the paper are presented in Section II. Section III describes
the proposed methodology based on quadratic optimization and
ALS. The synthetic evaluation for end-members and abun-

the set Ω. For a real vector x, the transpose√operation is denoted by x , the Euclidean norm by x2 = x x, and x  0

N-dimensional vector filled with ones is represented by 1N , and

II. LINEAR MIXTURE MODEL FOR M-FLIM DATA
According to the model in [3], every fluorescence decay mixture yk ,λ (t) is a linear combination of the fluorescence decay
profiles or end-members pn ,λ (t), and their fractional contributions or abundances αk ,n . From now on, we will refer to the fluorescence decay profiles simply as profiles or end-members. At
a certain spatial position k and wavelength λ, over t = 1, . . . , T
time samples, the data mixture is modeled as
yk ,λ (t) =

N


αk ,n pn ,λ (t)

∀k = 1, . . . , K, & λ = 1, . . . , W

n =1

(1)
where the abundance coefficients αk ,n are normalized at each

spatial position k, i.e., N
n =1 αk ,n = 1, K is the number of spatial locations in the sample, N is the number of end-members,
and W is the number of wavelength bands. The goal of blind
unmixing is to estimate the end-members pn ,λ , and their abundances αk ,n , which compose the mixture yk ,λ sampled at every
spatial position k of the m-FLIM data. The mixture model in
(1) can be written in a vector notation for the m-FLIM data over
the sampled time-window as
yk ,λ =

N


αk ,n pn ,λ

(2)

n =1

where yk ,λ = [yk ,λ (1) · · · yk ,λ (T )] and pn ,λ = [pn ,λ (1) · · ·
pn ,λ (T )] are the measurement vector at k space sample and
the end-member vector for nth component and λ wavelength,
respectively. To further simplify the notation, the information
at every position k is concatenated for all wavelength bands
λ = 1, . . . , W as a single vector for the nth end-member:

where D = W · T is the total number of time measurements
gathering all wavelength bands, W is the number of wavelength bands, and T is the number of time samples. The mixture
samples are formatted in a similar fashion


yk = yk,1 , . . . , yk,W

Hence, the linear model in (1) can be written in a matrix notation
by collecting the whole time samples and wavelengths as
yk = [p1 , · · · , pN ] [αk ,1 , · · · , αk ,N ]

Finally, by incorporating all the spatial samples, the mixture
model can be described by three matrices:

P

where A ∈ RN ×K is a matrix containing the abundances of
every end-member at each available position of the sample data,
and Y ∈ RD ×K is the overall m-FLIM measurement matrix.
To avoid redundancy in the linear mixture model in (2), the
end-members (p1 , . . . , pN ) are assumed linearly independent
and D  N , and as a result, P is a full-column rank matrix.
Meanwhile, the abundance matrix A is assumed full-row rank,
since it is assumed K  N .
In general, when working with fluorescence emissions, it is
difficult to measure the exact same intensity from a sample, even
if it contains the same components and it is under controlled
conditions, and specially from different imaging sessions. This
effect is due to many artifacts that may arise in fluorescence
imaging devices [17], [18]; this phenomenon is known as signature variability in the hyperspectral imaging literature [19].
These variations in the fluorescence intensity measurements will
result in differences between the decay profiles estimated in different samples even though they contain the same fluorophores
and remain with the same concentrations. Another effect due to
these fluctuations is that the mixtures might not be contained
within the simplex described by the original components, which
violates constraint (8) [20], [21]. To minimize the effects of
signature variability, it is a common practice to impose a normalization constraint on the measurement data at each spatial
location k, so that it is satisfied yk 1D = 1∀ k = 1, . . . , K. As
a consequence, the end-members are also

Therefore, considering all the restrictions and measurements
available, the complete linear unmixing problem for m-FLIM
data can be written as an approximation problem [9]

Consequently, the cost function in (7) evaluates the similarity
between the measurements and predicted linear mixtures. In
fact, the constraints in the vectors pn and αk can be expressed
as conditions in the matrices A and P, which can define the
following feasible sets:

ΩP = P ∈ RD ×N : P 1D = 1N and P  0 . (13)
From these definitions, the feasible sets ΩA and Ωp are convex
(see Appendix A), and thus, the quadratic approximation problem in (7) is solved over convex feasible sets. This property will
be crucial in order to guarantee a global optimum solution at
each step of our iterative search regardless of the ICs, as will be
shown in the following section.

In this study, our previous result on the abundance estimation [15], [16] is employed in conjunction with a new strategy
to estimate the end-members. The methodology assumes that
the number of components in the sample is known, and consequently, it is needed to estimate the end-members and their
respective fractional contributions or abundances. Moreover,
this strategy relies on ALS [22] in order to iteratively compute the blind end-member extraction, and next the abundances
estimation. This new scheme is based on the Berman et al. [7]
algorithm, but extended to include the sum-to-one and positivity
restrictions in the resulting end-members.

(16)

(18)

since AA is positive definite, and O is symmetric and diagonally dominant with positive entries in the main diagonal, so O
is a positive semidefinite matrix [25], which guarantees a minimum for the solution of the stationary conditions in (16)–(17).
The optimal closed-form solution is then given by

where the mathematical derivations are detailed in Appendix C.
In fact, the solution in (19) could produce negative elements,
since only the sum-to-one condition P 1D = 1N is enforced
by the Lagrange multiplier method. As a result, an orthogonal
projection is then proposed to the feasible set ΩP for any negative elements in (19) [24], i.e., any negative element in (19) is
set to zero and the rest of the elements each per column of P
are normalized.

related to the sum of the distances between the vertices of the
simplex generated by the end-members (p1 , . . . , pN ). These
distances should be minimized in order to search for the simplex
with the minimum volume containing the measured data [7].
Contrary to other approaches in [5], [12], and [23], the quadratic
regularization term simplifies the overall optimization process
in order to reach for a closed-form solution. In fact, from the
synthesis formulation in (14), a quadratic optimization problem
is proposed over a convex feasible set ΩP , and as a result,
an optimum solution can always be guaranteed. Next, the cost
function L(P, A) in (14) is extended by the equality restrictions
P 1D = 1N (end-members normalization) through Lagrange
multipliers [24], and also the equivalent representation of the

Therefore, we consider our previous closed-form solution in [16]
and [15] that is described in Algorithm 1. This algorithm requires
prior knowledge on the number of components N and the endmembers matrix P. A more detailed information regarding the
matrices employed in the algorithm can be found in Appendix D.
In fact, a quadratic regularization term is not needed in (21), as in
(14), since this optimization scheme is not ill-posed for linearly
independent end-members (p1 , . . . , pN ) [15], [16], i.e., there is
a unique solution at each spatial location [24].

due to the quadratic dependence of L on the end-members and
abundance matrices (P, A). Therefore, by defining

a decrement after each complete iteration is guaranteed:

(29)

Fig. 3 shows an example of this decreasing pattern for one of
the synthetic experiments described in the following section.
Furthermore, since the cost function L has a continuous dependence on the matrices (P, A), the local convergence of (27) is
also guaranteed. The overall iterative methodology is defined in
Algorithm 2.

C. BEAE for m-FLIM Data
First, it is important to point out that the cost function L(P, A)
in (14) depends on the product of two unknowns: end-members
P and abundances matrix A. Consequently, in order to reach
a solution to the joint minimization problem in (14), an ALS
formulation is adopted [22]. In this way, the solution to the
quadratically constrained blind end-member extraction in (19),
and the abundance estimation of Algorithm 1, are applied iter-

IV. SYNTHETIC EVALUATION
In this section, we generate synthetic m-FLIM measurements [15], [16] in order to provide a controlled scenario for
performance tests. The proposed method, called BEAE, was
evaluated and compared against two well-known iterative techniques: MVC-NMF [23] and MCR-ALS [26], which can deal
with the nonnegativity constraint in (9). These methods are also

capable of unmixing the m-FLIM data into multiple components, and require an initial estimation of the number of components, as well as initial end-member candidates, which will be
referred as IC. Two ICs were employed: the first one was chosen by spatial positions corresponding to pure samples of each
end-member and the second one was set to initial candidates
corresponding to mixtures of the pure samples that highlights a
more difficult scenario. In order to provide a fair comparison,
the sum-to-one constraint in (11) was imposed by normalizing
the end-members at the end of each iteration in MVC-NMF
and MCR-ALS. Meanwhile, the sum-to-one constraint for the
abundances in (8) was also forced by a proper projection and
scaling, since these methods do not satisfy it strictly.
Synthetic data were first generated in order to evaluate the performance of the blind end-member extraction algorithms. Two
scenarios were conducted by producing synthetic data with three
and five SEs. However, since both evaluations provided comparable quantitative results, just the test with the larger number
of components is illustrated next. A total of five SEs were constructed by using the stretched-exponential function from [15]
and [27] to simulate the intensity decay from endogenous fluorophores. The resulting end-members are depicted in Fig. 4.
They were employed as ideal end-members to generate the synthetic m-FLIM data. These end-members, referred as true profiles from now on, present high overlapping, and consequently,
the proposed unmixing problem presents important numerical
challenges.
An abundance map was generated to simulate a highly mixed
scenario without the presence of pure samples from a single
component. Additive Gaussian noise was added to characterize
the sensitivity of the m-FLIM data under the linear unmixing
model as
Y = PA + Υ

(30)

where Υ is a noise matrix of independently distributed Gaussian
samples with zero mean. The variance of the noise elements was
set to satisfy 15, 20, and 25 dB SNRs. The evaluated algorithms
were initialized by using mixture samples randomly selected
from the evaluated synthetic m-FLIM datasets. Two different
ICs for the end-members matrix P0 were selected to evaluate
the sensitivity of the solutions with respect to the initial point
in the iterative schemes. For each IC and SNR, 30 m-FLIM
datasets were considered for each algorithm. In the evaluation
of BEAE, the weight on the regularization parameter ρ in (14)
was set to 0.05, and the stoppage tolerance  to 0.001.
A. End-Member Extraction
The estimated end-members were compared against the true
fluorescence profiles from Fig. 4. The relative error was employed to asses quantitatively the quality of the extracted endmembers from the synthetic m-FLIM data. The PRE for a given
component n is defined as
PREn = 100 ×

pn − p
pn 2

∀n = 1, . . . , N,

 n denotes the estimated end-member and pn the true

of the PRE were estimated for each experiment comprising 30
simulations, and the results for each SE are shown in Table I. In
this table, the value in boldface per row indicates the best score,
or values that are within 5% tolerance of this best result.
The mean PRE for BEAE is the lowest in the majority of
experiments (70% of cases) under a large noise or uncertainty
environment (15 dB), and also the PRE presented the lowest
standard deviation (lowest variability) under this same condition, as noted in Table I. In the meantime, under low noise or
uncertainty conditions (25 dB), all three algorithms reported
similar mean PRE performance, but in almost all cases BEAE
reported less variability (standard deviation). The results from

Table I also show that BEAE obtained for its best estimation a
0.32% relative error, meanwhile 13.82% error for the worst-case
condition, despite the ICs in the iterative optimization procedure
plus noise effects. Meanwhile, MVC-NMF and MCR-ALS reported 0.25% and 0.24% minimum mean PRE, and 15.31%
and 13.26% in their worst-case performances, respectively. An
important feature of MVC-NMF and MCR-ALS is that they
consistently presented more variability in estimating the endmembers compared to BEAE, as can be seen from the standard
deviations of the PRE.
B. Abundance Estimation
The abundances were evaluated in a similar fashion to the endmembers. The estimated fractional contributions were compared
by using the abundance average error (AAE) computed over the
whole sample set as

5%. One can observe from the table that MCR-ALS and BEAE

TABLE II

ESTIMATED ABUNDANCE MAPS (THE LOWEST MEAN VALUES PER SCENARIO
ARE HIGHLIGHTED WITH BOLDFACE)

presented the lowest mean values at different ICs and SNR, but
the former achieved a higher variance in the AAE. BEAE reported more accurate results in the presence of large noise or
uncertainty (15 dB). Moreover, BEAE obtained a mean AAE
between 0.0507 and 0.1163 for all conditions with very low variability with respect to the other two methods. In the meantime,
MVC-NMF and MCR-ALS achieved 0.0648 and 0.0415 for its
minimum mean AAE, and 0.1679 and 0.1484 under the worstcase conditions, respectively. These results illustrate that BEAE
presents more accurate estimation independent of the SNR and
ICs, resulting in a more robust approach. Meanwhile, MVCNMF achieves the worst-error performance with high variability
for all scenarios.
V. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
The blind end-member extraction algorithms (BEAE, MVCNMF, and MCR-ALS) were also tested by using m-FLIM
datasets from fresh postmortem human coronary atherosclerotic
plaques [6], [28]. Nonetheless, there is no quantitative description available that could be used as ground truth for a clean
comparison, so only qualitative evaluations are provided in this
section. In this way, using the fluorescence intensity decays for
collagen, elastin, and LDL as ICs for the end-members, the solution provided by the three algorithms is consistent, as can be
seen in Fig. 6(a), where one sample containing mostly elastin
and LDL was decomposed by using BEAE, MVC-NMF, and
MCR-ALS. On the other hand, when a mixture of the ideal endmembers were employed as an IC, only BEAE and MCR-ALS

provided similar solutions to the one obtained previously, but
not MVC-NMF, as can be seen in Fig. 6(b). This phenomenon
reflects the sensitivity of MVC-NMF to the ICs. We omit more
ex vivo results with MVC-NMF and MCR-ALS, since a quantitative evaluation cannot be achieved.
BEAE was further validated by using a total of six m-FLIM
ex vivo datasets [6], [28]. The m-FLIM data from the six samples were pooled together to estimate both the end-member
and component abundances. The estimated end-members are
shown in Fig. 7. The profiles of the first component (Fig. 7, top
panel) showed normalized intensities of 41%, 32%, and 27% in
the first, second, and third spectral channels, respectively, plus

average lifetime values between ≈ 7 and 11 ns, resembling the
fluorescence emission of LDL. The profile of the second component (see Fig. 7, middle panel) showed normalized intensities of
45%, 37%, and 18% in the first, second, and third spectral channels, respectively. The estimated average lifetime values were
between ≈ 7 and 8 ns, which are similar to the fluorescence
emission of collagen. Finally, the third component (see Fig. 7,
bottom panel) showed normalized intensities of 45%, 37%, and
18% in the first, second, and third spectral channels, respectively,
and average lifetime values between ≈ 6 and 7 ns, resembling
the fluorescence emission of elastin. Thus, the first, second,
and third estimated end-member profiles and the corresponding
abundance maps were associated with LDL (lipids), collagen,
and elastin, respectively.
Three of the six coronary samples presented a relatively uniform histopathology, as illustrated in Fig. 8. The first sample (see
Fig. 8, top panel) corresponded to an almost normal coronary
artery rich in elastin, shown as dark fibers in the histopathology evaluation, and the associated abundance maps showed
dominant contribution from elastin (≥ 60%), with lesser contribution from collagen (0–30%) and virtually no contribution
from LDL. The second sample (see Fig. 8, middle panel) cor-

responded to a thin-cap fibroatheroma with a large lipid core,
shown as empty spaces in the histopathology evaluation, where
the associated abundance maps presented dominant contribution from LDL (≥ 80%), with little to none contributions from
collagen and elastin. The third sample (see Fig. 8, bottom panel)
corresponded to a fibrotic plaque composed of mostly collagen,
shown as light-blue fibers in the histopathology evaluation, and
the associated abundance maps showed dominant contribution
from collagen (> 90%), with virtually no contributions from
neither elastin nor LDL.
On the other hand, the remaining three coronary samples
showed mixed histopathology samples, as shown in Fig. 9. The
first sample (see Fig. 9, top panel) corresponded to a plaque with
areas of significant content of elastin, collagen, and/or LDL, as
shown in the histopathology slide (corresponding to the middle
cross-section of the imaged plaque shown as a dotted black line
in the abundance maps). The abundance maps also indicated
areas dominated by LDL, collagen or elastin, reflecting a complex underlying histopathology. The second sample (see Fig. 9,
middle panel) corresponded to a plaque with a thick region rich
in lipids (left side on histopathology), and a thin region rich in
elastin (right side on histopathology). The abundance maps also

GUTIERREZ-NAVARRO et al.: BLIND END-MEMBER AND ABUNDANCE EXTRACTION

clearly indicated two distinct regions, one dominated by LDL
(top-left) and the other dominated by elastin (bottom-right), with
little to none contribution from collagen. The third sample (see
Fig. 9, bottom panel) corresponded to a plaque with a thin region
rich in elastin (left side on histopathology) and a thick region
rich in collagen (right side on histopathology). The abundance
maps evidently indicated two distinct regions: one dominated
by elastin (top) and the other dominated by collagen (bottom),
with little to none contribution from LDL.
VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
This study proposed a novel method to automatically detect
fluorescence end-members and their relative abundances in a
biological sample based on the analysis of m-FLIM data. A
comparison of the proposed method (BEAE) with two popular methods from the literature (MVC-NMF and MCR-ALS)
used for blind spectral unmixing is also presented. Our main
observations were the following.
1) The experimental results support the hypothesis that fluorescence measurements could be used to quantitatively
characterize a tissue sample, as a function of its endmembers and its respective abundances.
2) The BEAE methodology can be successfully employed
to perform end-member extraction and abundance quantification in m-FLIM data, regardless of the number of
components, and without the influence of the ICs in the
iterative search.
The synthetic simulations showed that BEAE is both robust to
noisy or uncertain data and is tolerant to high overlapping among
the fluorescence decay profiles. By comparing to other iterative
schemes as MVC-NMF [23] and MCR-ALS [26], one major
advantage of the BEAE algorithm is that, due to its quadratic
formulation over convex feasible sets, it always converges to
a minimum in the feasible region under the constraints in
(8)–(10). The comparison methods evaluated in this study,
MVC-NMF and MCR-ALS, are usually called blind source
separation methods, although they do require some prior information in order to provide a good solution. They need to know
the number of components to be solved, as well as some initial
solution within the feasible region subject to the constraints (8)–
(11), and close to the optimum solution for better performance.
The synthetic experiments were carried out by using ICs inside the same m-FLIM datasets. Our evaluations showed that
the performance of MVC-NMF could be seriously affected by
the selected IC or end-members; this phenomenon is specially
evident in the experimental evaluation in Fig. 6(b). As can be
seen in Tables I and II, BEAE scores the smallest error in endmember and abundance estimation, when there is large noise or
uncertainty in the data. MCR-ALS also obtained good performance specially when the SNR is high. However, this method
has higher computational cost among the algorithms tested. The
synthetic m-FLIM datasets have a dimension of 60 × 60 × 510
data, and the blind end-member extraction algorithms were implemented in MATLAB, under an operating system Ubuntu
12.04 AMD64. The computing unit has an Intel(R) Core(TM)
i5-2430 CPU at 2.40 GHz with 8 GB of RAM. The average

615

run-times for MVC-NMF and BEAE were 4.9 and 8.5 s, respectively, while the average time for MCR-ALS was 30.5 s.
In this way, MVC-NMF had the best processing time but the
worst performance (see Fig. 6). Hence, BEAE establishes a good
compromise between accuracy and computational time.
In our analysis, further experimentation is needed to estimate the optimal value for the regularization term ρ in (14),
and the tolerance  employed in the convergence criteria for
BEAE, since both values were tuned by trial and error to have
the best performance. In addition, once the end-members are
estimated, the physical identification of these components from
experimental databases is an another open problem.
Finally, by using postmortem human coronary atherosclerotic
plaques as validation elements, we have demonstrated that the
application of BEAE to the experimental m-FLIM data from
coronary plaques allowed estimating and identifying the three
main sources of autofluorescence, namely elastin, collagen, and
LDL. Furthermore, the associated abundance maps allowed the
characterization of the biochemical composition of the imaged
atherosclerotic plaques. These results thus demonstrate the potential application of BEAE to autofluorescence m-FLIM data
for molecular imaging of biological tissue.
APPENDIX A
The proof of convexity of the sets ΩA and ΩP is analogous,
so the discussion will be focused just on ΩA . First, take any
two elements B, C ∈ ΩA and ζ ∈ [0, 1]; then, a new matrix is
constructed:
D = ζB + (1 − ζ)C ∈ RN ×K .

(33)

Since 0 ≤ ζ ≤ 1 and B, C  0, D  0 is satisfied. Furthermore,
it is deduced that


D 1N = ζB  + (1 − ζ)C  1N = ζ1N + (1 − ζ)1N = 1N .
(34)
Therefore, it is concluded that D ∈ ΩA for any ζ ∈ [0, 1], and
consequently, ΩA is a convex set.

APPENDIX B
In this appendix, the regularization term used in the cost
function (14) is simplified in order to derive an equivalent representation in terms of matrix P. From (14), and following the
steps in [7], it is concluded that
