Tidal Volume Variability Monitoring System
in E-Health Applications

Abstract—A reliable long-term monitoring and diagnosis of
breath disorders at an early stage provides an improvement of
medical act, life expectancy, and quality of life while decreasing
the costs of treatment and medical services. Therefore, a real-time
unobtrusive monitoring of respiration patterns, as well as breath
parameters, is a critical need in medical applications. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for patient home care, capable of measuring respiration rate and tidal volume variability via
a wearable sensing technology. The proposed system is designed
particularly for the goal of diagnosis and treatment in patients
with pathological breathing, e.g., respiratory complications after
surgery or sleep disorders. The complete system was comprised of
wearable calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth low energy,
and cloud database. The experiments are conducted with eight
subjects and the overall error in respiration rate calculation is
obtained 0.29%±0.33% considering SPR-BTA spirometer as the
reference. We also introduce a method for tidal volume variability estimation while validated using Pearson correlation. Furthermore, since it is essential to detect the critical events resulted from
sudden rise or fall in per breath tidal volume of the patients, we
provide a technique to automatically find the accurate threshold
values based on each individual breath characteristics. Therefore,
the system is able to detect the major changes, precisely by more
than 98%, and provide immediate feedback such as sound alarm
for round-the-clock respiration monitoring.

I. INTRODUCTION
HE measurement of human respiratory signal is crucial
in cyberbiological systems. There are different respiratory disorders such as pneumothorax, obstructive sleep apnea
(OSA), emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), which can be the first symptom of different physiological, mechanical, or psychological dysfunctions. Based on
study in [1], more than 18 million people in the U.S. suffer
from OSA, while an estimate about 10 million people still remain undiagnosed. The undiagnosed OSA may increase the risk
of developing cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart

failure [2]. COPD is ranked as the sixth leading cause of death
worldwide in 1990 and it is predicted to be the fourth by 2030
due to an increase in smoking rates and demographic changes in
many countries [3], [4]. Changes in resting respiratory rate and
tidal volume are recognized as important indicators of physical
health or the exacerbation of medical conditions.
Although the polysomnography (PSG) remains as the de facto
gold standard technique for diagnosis of respiration problems
at sleep, in spite of its accuracy, it is complicated, expensive,
time consuming, and has to be conducted in medical centers
[5]. Moreover, it is unavailable for everyone since there are few
hospitals which provide PSG test especially in rural areas [5].
Therefore, a need has arisen for real-time portable devices with
acceptable accuracy, cost, and simple setup to monitor the parameters such as respiration rate, breathing pattern, and changes
in tidal volume over time. All these parameters can be measured
by direct methods, which require breathing through some measuring apparatus such as spirometer, nasal thermocouples, or
need medical expertise for implementing the devices such as
optoelectronic plethysmography. There have been a variety of
other traditional methods for monitoring respiratory components such as pneumatic respiration transducers, the fiber-optic
sensor [6], the Doppler radar [7], and electrocardiogram (ECG)based respiration measurements [8]–[13]. However, these techniques are obtrusive and are not practical to be integrated in a
body sensor network for continuous monitoring outside hospital environments. The respiratory rate is commonly assessed by
visual observation in medical centers, which is not practical for
remote monitoring and is also prone to error [14]. Therefore, designing a portable respiratory platform is needed for monitoring
outside clinical environs. An accurate data representative of a
subject’s natural behavior over extended periods of time (whole
day or even a week) would be of important utility in this realm.
Another potential application of such a monitoring system is
continuous tracking of patients after major surgery. Indeed, the
respiratory complications after surgery can be severe and, in
some cases, even fatal. Opioid-induced respiratory depression
is a risk factor after surgery, for which irregularity of breathing
and a rise in tidal volume variability are good indicators [15]. It
is noteworthy that the patient’s perspective should also be considered in designing a system from both research and clinical
viewpoints. Bergmann et al. [16] discussed the research-based
user-orientated design criteria for biomedical sensors. The outcomes derived from a population of 289 people indicating that,
for example, 51.8% of people did not like to wear a device which
is visible to others or 80.6% would allow the data to be sent away

and analyzed or stored on a database. It is also reported that,
71.6% of people agree to allow round-the-clock (24 h a day)
monitoring.
People spend up to one-third of their lives at sleep and rest
positions. This number will increase for patients whom the respiratory condition during sleep and rest positions has an important role in their health management. Therefore, in this paper, we
focus on implementing a portable platform based on a single accelerometer sensor which has been evaluated on an initial framework including wireless communication and cloud database. It
is to ensure the quality and accuracy of the estimated breathing parameters versus the previous methods in rest conditions.
The proposed system makes use of a calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth low energy (BLE), cloud database, and
smartphone. The accelerometer data are transmitted via BLE
to PC/Smartphone and then are sent to the cloud to be saved,
immediately. The previous systems often require a laptop, memory card or handheld PC to be carried by the subject due to the
processing, data storage, and power requirements of the sensory
equipment. However, applying cloud database yields significant
advantages over traditional methods, including increased online
accessibility, scalability, automatic failover, and fast automated
recovery from failures. Therefore, the system is suitable for long
intervals of data collection such as round-the-clock monitoring
due to enough storage space in the cloud. It is worth mentioning
that in case of network disconnection, the data are saved on the
intermediate interface. Therefore, the physicians can track the
patients wherever they are with devices such as an iPhone, iPad
or the web regardless of their proximity to the patients.
In this study, we achieve the best respiration rate accuracy
compared to the previous studies [17]–[22] in view of rest conditions. Since, to the best of our knowledge, there is no accurate
system to remotely obtain and show the graphical representation
of tidal volume variability (TVvar ), in this paper, we propose
an efficient technique to achieve TVvar from outside of medical
centers. It is noteworthy that, in addition to real-time monitoring of TVvar , it is essential to detect the critical events resulted
from sudden rise or fall in per breath tidal volume of the patients. Thus, for the first time, a design of an alert system is
proposed in order to precisely detect the major changes and
provide immediate feedback such as sound alarm for round-theclock respiration monitoring. A general view of the proposed
platform is shown in Fig. 1.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II
includes a literature review of related work. In Section III, a
procedure is used to accurately calculate the respiration rate.
TVvar is investigated from the accelerometer-drived respiration
signal in Section IV. Section V describes a new method for
calculating the threshold values of the alert system. In Section
VI, the results are presented and discussed. Finally, Section VII
concludes the paper. A preliminary version of this work has
been reported in [23].
II. RELATED WORK
There have been a variety of direct and indirect methods for
estimating respiratory parameters [24], [25]. For instance, the

flow meters including pressure transducers, thermal flow meters,
and ultrasonic flow meters are known as the direct methods. The
method based on the blood oxygen level [26] is an example of
indirect technique. This technique does not provide a reliable indication of changes in breathing pattern while has slow reaction
to breath disturbance. This time lag depends on the complexity of the algorithms and might exceed 15–20 s [26]. The pulse
oximetry has several limitations including ambient lighting, skin
pigmentation, tissue perfusion, and hemoglobin concentration
[27]. It is shown that this device is more likely to overestimate
the oxygen concentration at low saturations in individuals with
darker skin. The work presented in [28] also shows that the
monitoring respiration signal based on pulse oximetry has the
restriction of electromagnetic interference caused by electrosurgical cauterization units or cellular phones. In addition, in case
of perfusion reduction and small pulse amplitude, the device will
be prone to error and be unable to obtain a reading resulted in
generating false alarms [28]. The light emitted from the device is
harmful to the eyes, so the users should not stare at the light. The
pulse oximeters are not recommended for long-time monitoring
since painful feeling might appear if using the device ceaselessly, especially for the kids. Another indirect method is based
on the measurements of tracheal breath sounds. Although it is
an efficient method for detecting deep and low breathing sound
amplitude, it does not exceed the background noise, whereas the
relationship between the sound amplitude and air flow is very
difficult to detect [29]. Respiratory waveform was obtained by
using a piezoelectric respiration transducer in [30]. The sensor,
placed around the thorax, generates a high-level linear signal in
response to changes in thoracic circumference, associated with
respiration. They also proposed a Patient Personal Server to collect the data from the breathing module, processing the signal,
and then transmit it to a database stored on a telemonitoring
server. Recently, Kaltiokallio et al. [18] proposed a noncontact
system based on the COTS TX-RX Pair. The results are investigated on three types of experiments for one person in lying
position and different postures. The mean absolute error (MAE)
of 0.12 respiration per minute (rpm) is obtained for the respiration rate estimation. Nepal et al. [31] applied an abdominal

1534

strain gauge transducer for classifying the breath signal into apnea, normal respiration or respiration with motion categories.
They used second-order autoregressive modeling and zero-cross
algorithm in which the square root of energy index is considered as the baseline for respiration rate calculation. Another
monitoring method is the image-based system [32]. Tan et al.
[19] proposed a camera-based technique for real-time respiration signal and breath rate extractions. Their method includes
image- and signal-processing techniques to extract chest and
abdominal movements’ information from a sequence of video
recorded applying a single video camera. Their assessments indicated an estimation error of 3% for respiration rate considering
a 3–10 min test on a single subject in sitting position. Such a
monitoring system not only demands high cost, but also may be
considered to be an invasion of patients’ privacy. Furthermore,
the accuracy directly depends on the patients’ cloths patterns as
well as their distance from the camera. There are medical mattresses which can calculate the patient’s respiration and pressure
distribution [33]. When using a transducer under the mattress,
the changes of pressure produced by the respiration movements
are partially absorbed by the mattress; therefore, it is subject
to error and inaccurate results. Watson et al. [34] proposed a
method for monitoring respiration volumes by measuring the
inductance of an extensible electrical conductor closely looped
around the body to calculate the variations in the patient’s chest
and abdomen areas.
One recent area of interest is applying motion sensors to detect
the small movements of the body that occur during expansion
and contraction of the lungs in each respiration cycle. In [20],
an accelerometer and pressure sensors are worn on the body to
obtain the respiratory rate. In this study, the data were collected
by the data acquisition card, and then, the processing has been
run in LabVIEW software. In this assessment, respiratory rates
deviate less than 0.5 units (breaths/min) from Finapres as the
reference signal. An oximeter combined with an accelerometer sensor is used in [35] to diagnose sleep apnea, COPD, and
asthma. They investigated the impact of body posture in analyzing the respiratory movement. They also proposed a method
to detect the apnea and hypoapnea events in real time, and then,
apnea/hypoanpea index (AHI) is calculated. The analyzed data
are recorded on a PC or cellphone to be sent to the remote
center or physicians. However, the limited data storage might
bring problems especially for daily monitoring applications. A
validation of respiratory signal derived from suprasternal notch
acceleration has been investigated by Dehkordi et al. [17] for
different body positions. They show that the respiration rate
from the accelerometer has 1.55% error with respect to the
spirometer. Their data storage and processing are performed
on a computer with their custom-built LabVIEW Virtual Instrument. Moreover, the respiration rate is estimated by strain gauge
transducer and the error rate of 4.9% is achieved with respect to
the spirometer signal. In [21], the respiratory component is also
extracted from the accelerometer mounted on the suprasternal
notch of subjects. The vibrations are recorded with a transducer
electronic data sheets lightweight piezoelectric accelerometer.
The results are evaluated versus the sleep laboratory PSG as the
reference. Their results represent the feasibility of implementing

an accelerometer-based portable device for respiration recording. The data acquisition is done with a compact system and a
laptop where data were stored to be used later. ECG, three-axis
accelerometer, and respiration belt data were used and analyzed
in [22] from ten healthy volunteers. The respiration signal and
heart rate are extracted offline from the accelerometer sensor
and compared with the reference. The data are collected in a
memory stick and analyzed later in a computer. Silva et al. [36]
evaluated a system comprised of a microprocessor with an accelerometer sensor for breath study in both animals and humans.
This method is based on on-board signal processing and alarm
means. The authors in [37] introduced a fusion algorithm for accelerometer and gyroscope signals to calculate respiration rate.
They considered two types of exercises, and the respiration rate
errors are calculated as 4.6% and 9.54% versus the piezoelectric
respiratory belt for the treadmill and leg press, respectively.
Bailon et al. [11] proposed an ECG-based technique for calculating the respiration frequencies both on simulated and real
data during stress testing. The respiration error rate of 0.5% ±
0.2% is reported for simulated signal, while this error increases
to 5.9% ± 4% considering 12 leads worn by 34 subjects in a real
test. Furthermore, Lázaro et al. [12] proposed a method for respiration rate estimation based on the ECG signal. They tried different combination of 12-lead ECG which was digitalized with
a sampling rate of 1000 Hz, and an airflow-thermistor-based
technique was used with sampling rate of 50 Hz as the reference
device. The best error in respiration rate estimation with normal breathing pattern is achieved 1.07 ± 8.86% based on using
three Vectorcardiographic (VCG) leads. Lázaro et al. [13] also
proposed an algorithm based on the combination of information
from several ECG-derived respiration signals to provide an estimation of respiration rate. A relative error of 0.50 ± 4.11%
for tilt test and 0.52 ± 8.99% for stress test are computed from
VCG leads. The issue with ECG is that the electrodes are taped
directly on the skin. Therefore, removing the adhesive bonding
will cause the skin tissue injury and contact skin dermatitis if
they are in use for long time [38]. Due to this fact, they are not
recommended to be used for round-the-clock monitoring applications. In the proposed framework, there is no need to connect
the sensory node directly on skin which may cause sweating or
irritations for sensitive skins such as for newborn infants or kids.
Furthermore, the previous works are mostly based on recording
the ECG data from the laboratories or hospital facilities; however, the important advantages of our platform are its ability to
be used in e-health applications with different functionalities
such as body position monitoring, paradoxical breathing diagnosis [39], breath timing analysis as well as breathing therapy
[40]. Table I summarizes the previous methods that have been
used for respiratory parameters estimation.
Based on study in [41] for patients suffering from breath
disorders, the destruction of lung capacity occurs over an initial period of two to four days. Thus, continuous monitoring
of the tidal volume variability plays an important role in respiration disorder diagnosis. According to [42], for a fixed set
of patient conditions, the alveolar ventilation depends on tidal
volume variability. Alveolar ventilation refers to the amount of
air reaches the alveoli for gas exchange with blood per unit time.

At normal rates of positive pressure ventilation, if the tidal
volume goes less than or close to total dead space (about 26%
of the resting normal tidal volume [43]), it will cause the lack
of alveolar gases, regardless of the respiratory rate and minute
volume. This would cause carbon dioxide retention in the bloodstream rapidly as well as progressive lung disease, deteriorating
ventilation-perfusion matching and, eventually, impaired oxygenation. Pneumothorax is another respiration disorder known
as “air in the pleural cavity” which has two major signs including shortness of breath (low breath volume) and Tachypnea
[44]. According to Chang and Mukherji [44], the incidence of
primary pneumothorax in the U.S. is 7.4–18 cases and 1.2–6
cases per 100 000 persons per year for men and women, respectively. Without continuous monitoring, people often do not seek
medical attention after their symptoms develop more serious due
to comorbidity causing secondary spontaneous pneumothorax
(SSP). Furthermore, emphysema known as a common cause of
SSP is a COPD where there is overinflation of the alveoli in the
lungs, resulted in breathlessness. Therefore, the symptoms associated with pneumothorax, emphysema, and COPD are most
likely diagnosed through analyzing respiration patterns, such as
Tachypnea and shallow breathing pattern.
At the opposite side, too large tidal volume may produce
alveolar and airway over distension, which may lead to lung injury such as overexpansion, pulmonary interstitial emphysema,
and pneumothoraces. Dreyfuss et al. have shown that breathing
with large tidal volumes causes the fluid accumulation in the
air spaces and parenchyma of the lungs resulted in pulmonary
edema [45]. Hernandez et al. [46] explored the effects of high
tidal volume on immature rabbits and demonstrated the major
role of volume distension of the lung in the progress of lung
injury.
Therefore, in this paper, we focus on proposing a remote
monitoring system which will enable proactive home monitoring of the patients with estimating both respiration rate and tidal
volume variability at rest. It is useful for an aging population
and resulted in lowering the cost of healthcare by moving some
of the eligible patients from hospital to home. Therefore, the
system is capable of remote, ubiquitous monitoring, and timely
risk alarming if a severe respiratory distress occurs.
III. RESPIRATION RATE MEASUREMENT
Discovering most frequent vital signs remotely, such as respiration rate, has been in the interest of the medical research community in recent years. In this section, a procedure is described
to estimate the respiration rate with accelerometer signal at the
rest positions considering the spirometer as our reference. In order to deliver high accuracies for the sensor measurements, we
first perform a calibration technique using least-squares method
proposed in [47]. Calibration, which is defined as the process
of mapping raw sensor readings into corrected values, can be
used to compensate the systematic offset and gain [48]. Note
that when the gain and offset are both constant values and independent from the sensor measurements, then the calibration is
translated into a linear curve-fitting function.

before and after resampling procedure.

Generally, different special tools with specialists experience
are required for sensors calibration; however, a straightforward
method to calibrate an accelerometer is performed at six stationary positions [47]. We need to collect a few seconds of
accelerometer raw data at each position. Then, the least-squares
method is applied to obtain the 12 accelerometer calibration
parameters. The sensor quality and criticality of the application
determine the calibration frequency, which can be manually performed. The calibration procedure can be briefly explained as
follows:

where

stationary positions;
2) vector y is the known normalized Earth gravity vector;
3) matrix X is the 12 calibration parameters, which is determined as follows:

	−1 T

(3)

Our analysis is based on the acceleration signals recorded
with a three-axis accelerometer mounted on the subject’s chest.
According to the location of the sensor in this study, the major
direction is z-axis, which clearly reflects the anterior–posterior
motions of the chest.
Indeed, the normal breathing rate for a human being is usually
between 0.2–0.3 Hz and the maximum frequency is not likely
to go over 0.7–0.8 Hz [31]. Therefore, the breathing signal can
be considered as a low-frequency signal which must be filtered
using a low-pass filter to remove the unnecessary and unwanted
high-frequency components. To eliminate the disruption movements, the raw sensor data are filtered through a tenth-order
Butterworth low-pass filter with cutoff frequency 1 Hz. Fig. 2
illustrates a part of respiration volume for the normal breathing
pattern of a 29-year-old man. We apply a numeric integration

algorithm in which the trapezoidal rule was used to estimate
the area under the flow curve and obtain the respiratory volume from the spirometer signal drawn in black in Fig. 2. As
can be seen, even though two signals seem similar, there is
an unwanted cumulative error [37] over time affected on their
synchronization. Indeed, this type of error on signals is due to
different sampling frequencies. Although the sampling rates of
accelerometer and spirometer are both set to 50 Hz, due to the
architecture of the inertial measurement unit, there might be a
small difference between the sampling rate and measured frequency. Thus, to compare the respiration rates, it is essential
to ensure that both signals have identical frequencies. For this
purpose after rational fraction estimation, we resample our data
by an antialiasing low-pass FIR filter during the resampling process. In our experiments, the sampling rate of the accelerometer
sensor was set to 50 Hz, however; the data were logged with
about 51 Hz (measured frequency). With resampling process
explained above, we could compensate the time lead about 0.02
per second. The solid blue line in Fig. 2 represents the final signal
after resampling procedure. Note that the system automatically
checks the number of samples in each analysis window to find
the measured frequency of the sensor. Now, the respiration rate
can be computed based on the number of local maxima in the
breath signals per minute. In order to compare the correlation
of respiration waves of accelerometer and spirometer as well as
the respiration rate, the best starting points of two signals are
obtained based on the peak value of their cross correlation.
IV. GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF TIDAL
VOLUME VARIABILITY
The measurement of tidal volume variability requires devices
such as spirometer or pneumotachometer connected to the patient with a mouthpiece and nose clip or face masks. Indeed,
the patients might have to wear nose clips during the procedure
to prevent air leakage from the nose and they should breathe
from the mounts with sealing their lips around the mouthpiece.
These types of equipment are uncomfortable, and may cause
a sensation of smothering [49], whereas they are impractical
and not easy-to-use for long-time monitoring or during sleep,
especially for babies and kids. The spirometers are mostly used
in pulmonary function test, which has to be conducted at the
bedside, in a physician’s office, or in a pulmonary laboratory
under the expert’s supervision. Even though this type of test is
short in time, patients may become lightheaded or dizzy after
the test. Therefore, a monitoring method with simple setup and
good accuracy for remotely estimating TVvar on a breath-bybreath basis is crucial. Study in [50] shows that increased tidal
volume variability in children is a better sign of opioid-induced
respiratory depression than decreased respiratory rate. It is due
to the fact that an increasing in TVvar is ten times of a drop in
respiratory rate. Besides, rising in TVvar also correctly predicts
respiratory depression twice as often as decreased respiratory
rate.
Indeed, the advantages of tidal volume variability monitoring as an indicator of impending respiratory depression are
that TVvar is more sensitive than the respiratory rate and the

1537

magnitude of the changes is larger. It is worth noting that tidal
volume variability is independent of age-related variations unlike respiratory rate [50]. Fig. 3 shows the tidal volume variability and respiratory rate along with increasing doses of remifentanil in a typical patient. This patient was given five doses
of remifentanil starting with 0.04 μg/kg/min and ending with
0.127 μg/kg/min. Ansermino and Shelley [51] demonstrate that
an increase in tidal volume variability correctly identified that
the next dose would cause respiratory depression in 41% of
patients. The respiratory rate less than ten breaths per minutes
(bpm) correctly identified imminent respiratory depression in
only 22% of the patients. Furthermore, TVvar increased by
336% over baseline during the penultimate dose and by 668%
during the last dose. However, the respiratory rate, in contrast,
decreased by 32% during the penultimate dose and by 56%
during the last dose [51].
It is also well known that severe lung impairment in cystic
fibrosis (CF) may compromise respiratory muscle function at
rest. Patients with pulmonary disease caused by CF are known
to have changes in their breathing pattern at rest. Hart et al. [52]
reported these changes, specifically by a rapid rate and low tidal
volume pattern associated with further impairment of gas exchange. Hence, monitoring of the tidal volume changes provides
early identification and timely treatment of exacerbations with
decreasing the hospital admissions, disease costs, and slow deterioration. In this paper, we introduce a new method to accurately
estimate TVvar with a single accelerometer. According to study
in [34], the breath volume is equal to a corresponding change
in the compartmental volume of the torso which is found to be
fairly accurately represented by a changes in the cross-sectional
area of the chest during a breath cycle. So, in our experiments,
the accelerometer is attached on the chest to measure the inclination changes which are closely correlated with tidal volume
variability. To eliminate the impact of the postures, in this study,
first, we rescale the respiration signal and then calculate the per
breath tidal volume. Indeed, this technique makes the breath
volume to be independent of body position.

from accelerometer sensor and (h) from SPR-BTA spirometer.
Indeed, it indicates that there are negative and positive peaks of
tidal volume in the fourth and seventh windows, respectively.
These changes are due to the rapid respiration epochs followed
by regular periods of apnea [see Fig. 4(a) and (e)] in Biot’s
respiration pattern.
V. EMERGENCY ALERT DETECTION
Continuous patient respiration monitoring with high sensitivity for detection of critical events is essential. In this part, we
propose a new method to detect the critical points of tidal volume
variability using symbolic representation of time series (symbolic aggregate approximation—SAX) [53] in real time. This
method can be included in the platform to provide immediate
feedback mechanism for round-the-clock breathing monitoring.
Therefore, in case of sniffing a problem, it activates the sound
alarm systems immediately or sends an email or SMS alert to
the caregiver, family members or physicians.
People have different breathing characteristics such as rate,
volume, tidal volume variability, and pattern which result in
various threshold values for an alarm detection system. In this
paper, we apply the SAX technique in order to dynamically find
the accurate threshold values based on each individual breath
characteristics in a short amount of time (∼0.2 s). The main goal
is generating real-time alert if the conditions of the patients are
not suitable to make a call.
A. Symbolic Aggregate Approximation
Lin et al. [53] introduced the SAX which allows a time series
C of length n to be represented in a w-dimensional space by a
vector C = c1 , . . . , cw . The ci is calculated as follows [54]:
n

w
ci =
n

w i


cj .

(7)

j = wn (i−1)+1

The average value of the data within an episode is calculated and a vector of these values over w intervals shows the
dimensionality reduced representation. Before this transformation which shows the piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA)
of the time series, we have standardized the data to have a mean
of zero and a standard deviation of one. If a time series is plotted
in a Cartesian space, the PAA divides the x dimension into a set

of intervals with an equal size [55]. Fig. 6(a) depicts the tidal
volume of a subject after signal normalization and his PAA.
A further transformation is applied to obtain a discrete representation known as discretization. We need to have a technique
that produces symbols with equiprobability [56], [57]. This is
easily achieved due to Gaussian distribution of the normalized
time series [58].
We have applied SAX on per breath tidal volume achieved
from the accelerometer data after signal normalization. The results show an accurate feedback alarm while there are major
changes in tidal volume; however, in case of constant tidal volume, it will generate false alarms. Therefore, to avoid this and
keep the data in an appropriate range, we have modified the data
by injecting a square pulse at the end with zero and maximum
value of the signal. The length of the pulse is considered either an episode size or the data size. The results are brought in
Section VI while considering three scenarios: per breath tidal
volume, per breath tidal volume with small pulse and large pulse.
Fig. 7 represents the normal probability plot of the cumulative
distribution from all considered respiration patterns. It shows
the results from three scenarios with episode size 3 for eight
different volunteers. The linear nature of the plot suggests the
data derived from a Gaussian distribution [53]. Now, the “breakpoints” can be determined to produce α equal-sized areas under
Gaussian curve [58].
Definition: “Breakpoints are a sorted list of numbers B =
β1 , . . . , βα −1 such that the area under a N (0, 1) Gaussian curve
from βi to βi+1 = 1/α (β0 = −∞,βα = +∞)” [53].
These breakpoints are determined in a statistical table. Table II
gives an example of the breakpoints for values of α from 3 to
6. Based on the equiprobable regions, Fig. 6(b) shows a sample
of the alphabetic representation of per breath tidal volume with
α = 4. The goal is to identify the critical points of tidal volume

remotely and generate an alert in case of transaction to “a” or
“d” sections. The SAX process is linear in time which makes it
suitable for stream processing in our real-time monitoring.
The proposed method is briefly described in Algorithm 2. The
new notations are defined as follows:
Ai Alarm state for ith episode;
Si Symbol (Alphabet) for ith episode;
Li ith letter.
In step 1 of Algorithm 2, we standardized the data to have a
mean (μ) of zero and a standard deviation (σ) of one. Then, in
lines 2–6, the original time series with length n is transformed
into PAA representation with size w. From steps 7–16, the symbolic discretization is done considering the previous lookup table with the breakpoints that divide a Gaussian distribution in α
equiprobable regions. Finally, the alarm detection is performed
in lines 18–23. Since we set α to 4, the proposed system will
generate an alert in case of transition to L1 or L4 sections due to
our observation brought in Section VI.
VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. Test Setup
The general view of the proposed platform is described in
Fig. 8. The participants of this study were four males and
four females aged 18–46. They were instructed how to perform each breath exercise before their recording sessions. The

experimental trials lasted for about 45 min (seven breathing signals) per subject resulted in a total of 56 different signals. An
ultra-low-power LIS3DH three-axis accelerometer is used with
12-bit resolutions and 50-Hz sampling rate. We have used the
connectBlue cB-OLP425 BLE module which is based on the
CC2540 BLE SoC from Texas Instruments. The module is using an internal surface mounted (SMD) antenna with a range of
50 m which is included in FCC, IC, R&TTE, and TELEC radio
tests. Bluetooth smart technology provides strong encryption
and authentication of data packets resulted from a full AES128 encryption. We have modified the available version of iOS
application (“OLP425”) provided by ConnectBlue for both calibration and communication with cloud.
In the test setup, we asked the subjects to perform Normal
(P1), Bradypnea (P2), Tachypnea (P3), and Kussmaul (P4) patterns, each for 1 min, Cheyn–Stokes (P5) and Biot’s (P6) each
for 2 min, and finally a pattern with different tidal volumes
(P7) lasted for about 3 min. We assigned a 3-min rest interval after performing each pattern. Based on the definitions, for
Normal breathing, we consider 12–20 rpm, in Bradypnea less
than 12 rpm and for Tachypnea the subjects are asked to breathe
more than 20 respirations per minute. For simulating apnea in
Cheyn–Stokes and Biot’s breathing exercises, we requested the
participants to pause breathing for about 20 s.
The sensor was mounted on the subject’s chest in the middle
of sternum region and secured by a soft and elastic strap which is
easy to attach and comfortable to wear over the cloths. In the trial
session, the subjects were in the lying position (torso at about
45° angle to the floor) on a chair; however, the rest positions or
activities in which rib cage is stationary could be considered.
The SPR-BTA spirometer signal is used as our reference that
measures the oral breathing. A nose clip was used to prevent
nasal breathing during recordings. The Go!Link USB sensor
interface is used as the data logger of our spirometer.
B. Accelerometer-Drived Respiration Waveform Validation
In this section, the correlation between the spirometer and
accelerometer signals as well as the respiration rate are calculated using a 10-s nonoverlapping sliding window for Normal
and five breathing disorders Bradypnea, Tachypnea, Kussmaul,
Cheyn–Stokes, and Biot’s.
Bradypnea is regular in rhythm but slower than normal in rate.
It may cause by OSA which resulted in continuous disruption
of breathing during sleep or from heart attack [59]. Tachypnea is the condition of rapid breathing which may occur due to
physiological or pathological problems [60]. Kussmaul which
is defined as a rapid, deep, and labored breathing type usually
occurs in diabetic ketoacidosis. It is known as a type of hyperventilation, which reduces carbon dioxide in the blood due
to increased rate and depth of respiration [61]. Cheyn–Stokes
breathing pattern is determined by gradually increasing, then
decreasing the lung volume with a period of apnea. Therefore,
this type of breath disorder is characterized by a high oscillatory tidal volume. This type of respiration problem can be seen
in people with heart failure, strokes [62], [63], traumatic brain
injuries, and brain tumors. People suffering from Central Sleep
Apnea Syndrome have the same breathing pattern at sleep, as

well [64]. Biot’s breathing is characterized by periods of rapid
respiration followed by regular periods of apnea. There are different reasons which cause Biot’s breathing, such as damage to
the medulla oblongata by stroke (CVA) or trauma, or pressure
on the medulla due to uncal or tenorial herniation and prolonged
opioid abuse [65]. Fig. 11(a)–(f) shows all considered breathing
problems of an individual from both accelerometer and spirometer after normalization.
The correlation between two devices, an accelerometer sensor
(Acc) and spirometer (Spiro) with x samples, is calculated as
follows: (8) as shown bottom of the page
Table III listed the correlations for different subjects and
breathing maneuvers. For example, in Normal pattern, we have
8-min data for eight subjects and the mean correlation of the
accelerometer and spirometer signals is achieved 0.91. According to this table, the mean of the obtained correlations of all
breathing patterns is 0.84 which shows a very close agreement
between the accelerometer and reference method in respiratory
cycle durations.

where fest and fref are the respiration frequencies from accelerometer signal and reference spirometer, respectively. The
overall error rate is obtained 0.29% ± 0.33%. As depicted in Table III, the worst-case errors in all subjects occur in Bradypnea
(P2) pattern where patients breathe slower than normal respiration rate. The results demonstrate that we could obtain the best
accuracy for respiration rate measurement compared to [17],
dual strain gauge respirometers [17], and [19] in lying position
using a single accelerometer. In other words, the MAE of 0.05
± 0.01 bpm is achieved based on all breath models and subjects, so that the proposed technique can also surpass the MAE
of previous methods such as [18] with 0.12 bpm, [20] with 0.5
bpm, [21] with 3 bpm [22], and with 13.7 ± 4.14 bpm.
C. Graphical Representation of Tidal Volume Variability
We consider three types of pattern for tidal volume variability
evaluation. In Biot’s breathing, we expect to have reduction in
tidal volume in each apnea with no significant changes during
breathing cycles. However, in Cheyn–Stokes pattern, the tidal
volume increases gradually and then decreases to start an apnea
epoch. Additionally, we analyzed the changes in tidal volume
for normal to deep, deep to shallow, and shallow to normal
conditions (P7). Fig. 9 shows three respiration patterns for one
of the subjects with his tidal volume variability obtained from
accelerometer signal. There are positive changes from normal
to deep as well as from shallow to normal breathing. As shown
in Fig. 9(b), the variation from deep respiration to normal is
less than changing pattern from deep to shallow breathing. We
also obtain negative changes from deep to normal and deep to
shallow breathing. The directions of the changes in TVvar are

always the same as the spirometer in major changes. However,
the different directions are resulted from the small acceleration
movement of the body during constant tidal volume. To show
the impact of size, we have swept t from 2 to 10 breaths. Indeed,
t shows the sensitivity of the method. As can be seen in Table IV,
there is a tradeoff between t and correlation. Larger window size
resulted in better correlation of accelerometer versus the spirometer. This is due to unwanted motions of the rib cage during
constant tidal volume epochs. Applying larger window size removes the trends of constant tidal volume while keeping the

major changes. It is worth noting that, based on our patterns introduced earlier, we increase the size of window up to 10 breaths,
because there are always more than 10 breaths per cycle in all of
our patterns (P5, P6, and P7). Based on the respiration disorder,
if the tidal volume of the patient changes frequently, the small
window size is preferable; otherwise, larger size show the trend
of tidal volume accurately over time. Therefore, in our portable
platform, we could manage the appropriate sensitivity value for
the graphical representation of TVvar based on different breath
disorders characteristics.

three scenarios on all subjects. (c) Average accuracy of alarm system for all patterns with three scenarios on all subjects.

The overall correlation is obtained 0.87, whereas it proves
that TVvar derived from the accelerometer is strongly correlated
with spirometer. The average mean square errors (MSE) of the
estimated tidal volume variability versus the reference for three
types of patterns are 3.06E-05, 1.86E-03, 1.07E-03, and 4.33E04 with standard deviations 7.27E-03, 4.36E-03, 2.31E-03, and
8.41E-04 for t = 2, 3, 5, and 10, respectively. The errors do
decrease at the larger window sizes due to less sensitivity in the
constant tidal volume variability periods.
Observation 1: The computed MSE for each subject can be
fitted into a normal distribution, depicted in Fig. 10. In this
figure, the fitted normal distributions correspond to the average log-likelihood value of 124.8 ± 28.60 on differentt, which
indicates a good fit. Fig. 10 also shows the impact of the window size on MSE distributions. When the window is small, the
standard deviation is larger compared to the case with larger
window sizes. Therefore, e.g., with t = 10, the MSEs have less
dispersion from the average value of zero.
Therefore, a very high correlation between accelerometerdrived TVvar and spirometer indicates that the proposed method
is promising to be used in a respiration tracking systems specially for real-time monitoring of breath diseases during sleep.

P5, P6, and P7 with big square pulse injection on all subjects.

D. Experimental Results of the Proposed Alert System
We have assessed the respiration rate estimation as well as
a graphical representation of tidal volume variability in our remote monitoring platform. This section evaluates the method
we developed for discovering the critical turning points in per
breath tidal volume. As mentioned earlier, finding an accurate
threshold value to identify the emergency alarms during critical and major changes is required, either in circadian remote
monitoring or e-health centers. We propose a new method to
detect these changing points using symbolic representation of
time series [53]. The evaluation are performed on three scenarios: per breath tidal volume, per breath tidal volume with small
pulse and large pulse for eight people and all seven patterns.
From patterns P1–P4, there is no major changes in tidal volume
and we expect to have constant volume with no alarm; however
for patterns P5, P6, and P7, the system should alert five, two,
and three times, correspondingly, due to sudden increments and
decrements of tidal volume. In other words, we define the criti-

cal points as transition into a high or very low breath volume as
well as the apnea events.
Indeed, the SAX method removes the small redundant acceleration movement of the body during constant tidal volume.
Note that in our experiments, we focus on extracting the major
changes and we experimentally set the alphabet size to 4. However, to have more sensitive alert system, the users are able to
increase the number of alphabets.
In Fig. 11, we compare the symbolic representation of all
patterns for three scenarios and episode size 3. For example,
in Fig. 11(m), there are two false alarms generated by the system when there is no pulse in the data; however, injecting large
pulse reduces the number of false alarms into one, and with
small pulse, we can achieve zero false alarm. In Cheyn–Stokes
pattern, the system is supposed to alert in sudden increment and
decrement of the volume. For instant, in Fig. 11(k), the system
alerts five times with no false or undetected alarms. In other

example, consider Fig. 11(l), the system generates true alarms
in both ninth episode due to the sudden reduction of tidal volume and 12th episode after coming back into high constant tidal
volume in Biot’s pattern. It is worth mentioning that, in our
proposed system, the alert is generated when the tidal volume
enters into “a” or “d” sections based on the following observation. Furthermore, Fig. 9(c) shows the alerts when tidal volume
goes from normal to deep and deep to shallow breathing (three
alerts).
Observation 2: The best results are achieved by considering
“a” and “d” as critical sections among all 15 combinations of
four symbols. However, in case of any changes in the number
of symbols, the condition might be changed for emergency alert
generation.
The average accuracy values of alarm system with different episode sizes are shown in Fig. 12. We have changed the

episode size from 3 to 10 s. Fig. 12(a) depicts the accuracy
of the alarm system for patterns with constant tidal volume on
three scenarios. We note that the accuracy is almost constant for
different episode size, whereas for patterns with major changes
[see Fig. 12(b)], the larger the episode size the smaller the accuracy of alarm system. Moreover, the figures demonstrate the
improvement of the proposed alarm system after injecting both
small and large square pulses. The overall accuracy for all patterns is plotted in Fig. 12(c) in which the blue sign corresponds
to the best accuracy of 98.28% based on the small square pulse
with episode size equal to 3.
In Fig. 13, we brought the accuracy of three patterns P5, P6,
and P7, individually. It can be seen that the augmentation of
episode size more affects the alerts’ accuracy of Cheyn–Stokes
patterns than the Biot’s and P7 patterns in both large and small
pulse injections.

The results of positive predictive alarm (PPA), negative predictive alarm (NPA), false positive alarm rate (FPAR), and false
negative alarm rate (FNAR) are listed in Table V. PPA and
NPA denote the rates of true predicted existing and nonexisting
alarms. False positive and false negative alarms refer to false
alarms and undetected alarms, respectively. The formulas are
summarized as follows:

undetected alerts. Finally, to evaluate the usability and flexibility
of the proposed system, we asked our subjects to provide us a
number between 0 and 10 to score the ease of use and flexibility
of our system. The results are depicted in Table III. The average
score is obtained 8.875, which demonstrates the comfortability
and flexibility of the proposed intelligent system while giving
more credits to accelerometer-based approaches as a simple and
cost-effective solution for m-health applications.
VII. CONCLUSION

Table V highlights the parameters for three patterns with
major changes. It is shown that the accuracy values of our alarm
detection system suffer when the episode size is incremented
resulted from high information loss values. Furthermore, the
rates of false and undetected alarms are low dramatically in
small episode size, while we could obtain high true positive and
negative rates. Therefore, in case of facing a problem, the alert
system will function properly as a sound alarm, email or SMS
alert to the physicians.
As an example, based on Table V, with episode sizes 3 and 4
(with injecting small square pulse), we could obtain more than
98% accuracy in all three patterns with various types of tidal
volume oscillations. In addition, the worst cases of PPA and NPA
with episode size 3, are 94.44% and 98.55%, correspondingly.
Besides, our intelligent alarm system is designed to take care
of the patients, and meanwhile, it should not be so sensitive
that leads to excessive false alarms. Hence, from Table V, it is
observed that the low rates of both false negative and positive
alarms (FPAR and FNAR) clearly demonstrate the robustness
of the proposed technique. The SAX technique depends on the
size of data; here, we apply SAX on all recorded data of our
individuals. However, after different executions, we conclude
the following observation.
Observation 3: Smaller size of data will result in more sensitivity for the proposed alarm system, so that the rate of false
positive alarm increases whereas the FNAR do decrease at the
same time. Therefore, according to the criticality of the breath
disorder, the data size should be chosen based on the require
sensitivity prescribed by the doctor.
The overall rates and accuracies based on all patterns (P1–
P7) and conditions are outlined in Table VI. Our experimental
results show that applying the SAX method on tidal volume
after small square pulse injection can attain at least 83.92%
accuracy with episode size 10, whereas the best accuracy of
98.28% is achieved with episode size 3 (bold line in Table VI).
In the proposed technique, the false negative and positive alarm
rates are also very low which show considerably low false and

This paper investigated the problem of remote monitoring of
respiration as well as extracting the breath information, accurately. It helps to decrease diagnosis time and efficiently improve
medical services. We introduced a method to obtain respiration
rate and tidal volume variability from an accelerometer data as
a reliable and unobtrusive technique over extended periods. An
alert system is also designed for tidal volume emergency situation feedback. Therefore, the platform can perform essential
functions to fashion the signals received from the cloud, process
them, and eventually set off the emergency alert. Indeed, the proposed system is an integration of cutting-edge technologies such
as wearable sensors, standard BLE, and backend cloud storage
with prominent benefits of cost, convenience, patient comfort,
and quality of service. Our focus in the further will be adding
the concept of “breathing therapy” as another innovative way
for helping people to learn the science of breath in a systematic
way.
