Abstract—Cardiac-computed tomography angiography (CTA)
is a minimally invasive imaging technology for characterizing coronary arteries. A fundamental limitation of CTA imaging is cardiac
movement, which can cause artifacts and reduce the quality of the
obtained images. To mitigate this problem, current approaches involve gating the image based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) to
predict the timing of quiescent periods of the cardiac cycle. This
paper focuses on developing a foundation for using a mechanical
alternative to the ECG for finding these quiescent periods: the seismocardiogram (SCG). SCG was used to determine beat-by-beat
systolic and diastolic quiescent periods of the cardiac cycle for nine
healthy subjects, and 11 subjects with various cardiovascular diseases. To reduce noise in the SCG, and quantify these quiescent
periods, a Kalman filter was designed to extract the velocity of
chest wall movement from the recorded SCG signals. The average
systolic and diastolic quiescent periods were centered at 29% and
76% for the healthy subjects, and 33% and 79% for subjects with
cardiovascular disease. Both inter and intrasubject variability in
the quiescent phases were observed compared to ECG-predicted
phases, suggesting that the ECG may be a suboptimal modality for
predicting quiescence, and that the SCG provides complementary
data to the ECG.

statistics, coronary heart disease causes 16% of all deaths
nationally [1]. Accurately diagnosing, and subsequently treating, occluded coronary arteries is central to reducing these
deaths. The gold standard for evaluating coronary arteries, diagnostic catheter coronary angiography (CCA), is expensive
and invasive. More than 1.1 million CCAs are performed annually in the US, costing approximately $4 billion for the CCA
alone and resulting in more than 14 000 complications [1].
Computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTA), a minimally invasive alternative to CCA [2], can potentially reduce

both costs and the number of complications, while still providing sufficient resolution to examine the coronary arteries.
However, CTA suffers from artifacts and blurring of the image due to motion of the heart during the cardiac cycle [3].
These interferences that reduce image quality can potentially
be mitigated by only capturing the images during the quiescent periods of the cardiac cycle, if such quiescent periods can
be automatically and robustly detected in real time from the
patient.
The state of the art for CTA involves gating data acquisition
on quiescent periods predicted from a synchronously acquired
electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The primary drawback of this
technique is that the accuracy in detecting these quiescent periods with the ECG is greatly limited, due to the fact that the ECG
is an electrical signal, not mechanical, and thus the prediction
of the mechanical state of the heart is inferred, not measured.
Specifically, for a given cardiac cycle length determined by the
ECG R-R interval, the mechanical events within that cycle can
occur at different times and with different durations, depending
on the physiology of the ventricles. For example, the ratio of
the preejection period of the heart to the left ventricular ejection time has been shown to be significantly higher (0.51 versus
0.379, p < 0.05) for patients with lower contractility (as assessed
based on the maximal time-derivative of left ventricular pressure, dP/dtm ax , and the Frank–Levinson index of contractility)
[4]. We believe that the seismocardiogram signal (SCG), a measure of the mechanical vibrations of the chest wall in response
to cardiac motion and blood movement [5]–[7], can potentially
provide improved detection of cardiac quiescent periods compared to the ECG [8]–[11].
In this study, we determined cardiac quiescent periods as
time periods of minimal velocity magnitude derived from the
SCG acceleration signal. (Note that acceleration itself cannot be
used directly because zero acceleration can be present during
periods of constant velocity.) We focused on the dorso-ventral
SCG component, measured at the sternum, due to the fact that
this represents the most commonly studied, and characterized,
sensor location and axis for SCG measurements. With a miniature accelerometer and cabling, SCG measurement devices are
CT-compatible in that they will not cause significant streak artifacts in the images. Furthermore, SCG can potentially provide a
real-time index of quiescence, which can be used for gating the
acquisition of CT images. For these reasons, SCG has a strong
potential to supplement, or complement, the ECG as a cardiac
gating signal for determining quiescent periods for image acquisition.

Signal processing flow to determine chest wall velocity from the SCG.

Fig. 2. Examples of the intermediate signals used to determine chest wall velocity from the SCG. Signals are normalized to have a mean of zero and a maximum
of one. Signal names correspond to the labels in Fig. 1.

II. METHODS
Briefly, our procedure for extracting quiescent periods from
the SCG signal consisted of the following steps: 1) Measuring
and recording SCG signals simultaneously with ECGs; 2) Preprocessing the SCG signal using linear filtering to reduce noise,
heart sound components, and baseline wander due to respiration;
3) Using a Kalman filter to estimate the velocity of chest wall
movement from the SCG acceleration signal; 4) Calculating a
moving root mean square (rms) power from this velocity signal;
and 5) Determining, on a beat-by-beat basis, the samples in time
at which the moving rms from the velocity signal was below a
threshold. In the rest of this section, we will first present our
subject data acquisition procedure, followed by a discussion of
the mathematical basis for detection of cardiac quiescence from
SCG based first on beat-by-beat analysis followed by an analysis of composite signals. This will be followed by application
of these mathematical techniques to the subject SCG data.
A. Subjects and Data Acquisition
Twenty subjects—nine healthy and eleven with various
cardiovascular diseases—participated, after obtaining written
consent, in the Emory University Institutional Review Board
approved study. For each subject, an ADXL327 accelerometer (Analog Devices, Cambridge, MA) was placed on the end
of the sternum with tape, superior to the xiphoid process, and
the dorso-ventral accelerations were measured. Simultaneously,
ECG electrodes were placed on the chest for a modified Lead
II ECG measurement. The SCG and ECG data were acquired
using a custom data acquisition box at a sampling rate of 1.2
kHz. For details on the measurement setup, the reader is referred
to [11].
B. Beat-by-Beat Detection of Cardiac Quiescence from SCG
The SCG measured from the chest is an acceleration signal
which includes cardiogenic and noise/interference components.

To achieve robust estimation of the velocity, while rejecting the
noise/interference contributions, we implemented linear filtering and designed a Kalman filter [12], [13] as summarized in
Fig. 1. From this velocity signal, we will subsequently define
the quiescent periods as periods of minimal velocity. Examples
of the signals specified in Fig. 1 are plotted in Fig. 2.
The acceleration SCG signal is first low-pass filtered (fc =
20 Hz), to remove higher frequency signal content associated
with noise and heart sounds [14], then high-pass filtered (fc =
2 Hz) to remove dc offset and respiratory baseline wander. The
resulting signal, a(i), is then passed through a Kalman filter to
obtain a robust estimation for the chest wall velocity, v(i). It
should be noted that patients are instructed to hold their breath
during cardiac CT exams and therefore respiratory motion does
not generally contribute to CT motion artifacts.
The model state for this Kalman filter is defined as

T
(1)
x(i) = x(i) v(i) a(i) j(i)
where x(i) represents position, v(i) is the velocity, a(i) is the
acceleration, and j(i) is the jerk of the SCG accelerometer
sensor. The equations for updating the filter can then be defined
as
x(i) = x(i − 1) + v(i − 1)Δt
+ a(i − 1)

a(i) = a(i − 1) + j(i − 1)Δt

(2c)

j(i) = j(i − 1)

(2d)

where Δt is the sampling period. By introducing jerk into the
model, the accuracy of a(i) will increase because the assumption
of constant acceleration between samples is no longer necessary.
Although (2d) indicates that jerk is constant, this is not the

case—Rather, the resulting model error in the jerk term can be
mitigated by setting the process error associated with the jerk
term equal to the expected variance of the jerk.
The Kalman update equation for this model is thus defined as
x(i) = Ax(i − 1) + w

(3)

where A is the state transition matrix and w is the process error.
Next, the observation equation is defined as
z(i) = Hx(i) + v

(4)

where z(i) is the observation, H is the measurement matrix, and
v is the measurement noise at time index i.
The update equations, defined by (2), result in a statetransition matrix of

The jerk term of the process error, w, will be equal to the
variance of dj/dt. This variance is approximated by computing
the variance of a(i + 1) − 2a(i) + a(i − 1).
Because only acceleration is measured by SCG, the measurement matrix will be



(6)
and the measurement error, v, is equal to the variance of the
signal noise in a(i).
After computing v(i) using this Kalman filter, a second highpass filtering operation (fc = 2 Hz) is implemented, and the

output of this final stage is vSCG (i), the estimate of the movement velocity of the chest wall as a function of time. For the
purposes of determining quiescent periods, only the magnitude
of this velocity is relevant, not the phase; accordingly, we implemented a windowed rms filter to determine v̂SCG (i), the
approximate magnitude of chest wall velocity as a function of
time. We set the window length to 83 ms based on two factors:
1) to smooth rapid fluctuations in vSCG (i) that are unlikely to
be physiologic, but rather related to noise or interference; and
2) the 83-ms window corresponds to the typical time of a single
data acquisition period on a dual-source CT scanner (e.g., the
SOMATOM Definition Flash, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen,
Germany). As a result, each data point of v̂SCG (i) represents
the rms power of chest wall velocity for a length of time corresponding to the CT slice data acquisition, centered around time
i. The windowed rms is calculated as

where N is is the number of samples corresponding to 83 ms.
The overall signal delay from the signal processing flow is approximately 30 ms. An example of vSCG (i) and v̂SCG (i) along
with the synchronized ECG is shown in Fig. 3 for both a healthy
subject, and a subject with cardiovascular disease.
Quiescent periods are then determined as time intervals when
v̂SCG (i) is less than the mean of v̂SCG for each cardiac cycle as
defined by the synchronously acquired ECG.
C. Quiescence from Composite Velocity Signals
The two key aims of this study are: 1) to quantify the relative
position, within the cardiac cycle, at which the quiescent periods

Fig. 4. Images of composite velocity magnitudes, v m (i), across the range of observed heart rates for two healthy subjects (Subjects 4 and 7) and two cardiac
patients (Subjects 12 and 16). The longest systolic (left) and diastolic (right) quiescent periods are indicated in white for each subject. The center of each quiescent
period is indicated by a white circle and the duration is indicated by the line passing through that circle.

occurred based on the chest wall velocity magnitude, and 2) to
determine the changes in these relative positions within the cardiac cycle as a function of heart rate. Accordingly, each subject’s
velocity magnitude signal, v̂SCG (i), is first segmented based on
the heartbeat timings derived from the simultaneously-acquired
ECG signal, then sorted into groups based on the instantaneous
heart rate for each cycle (calculated from the R-R interval). After sorting by instantaneous heart rate, the segmented cycles are
time-scaled to equal length, allowing the groups to be averaged
and compared. This process is summarized as
v m (i) =

1
Nm



v̂n (i)

(8)

v̂ n ∈H m

where v m (i) is the composite velocity magnitude signal for
heart rate range Hm , Nm is the number of cycles in the range
Hm , and v̂n (i) is the nth time-scaled velocity magnitude cycle in Hm . Quiescent periods are determined from each v m (i)
providing cardiac quiescence information as a function of instantaneous heart rate for each subject. Similar to beat-by-beat
detection presented in Section II B, quiescent periods are detected as time intervals when v m (i) is less than the mean of
v m (i).

D. Features of Quiescence from Velocity Signals
For each subject, the systolic and diastolic quiescent periods
were identified on a beat-by-beat basis from the velocity magnitude signal [v̂SCG (i)], and both the center position (as a percentage of the cardiac cycle) and the duration (in milliseconds)
were computed for these periods. Systolic quiescent periods are
defined as the longest quiescent period with a center position
occurring before 60% of the cardiac cycle, as defined based on
the R-R interval of the ECG. Diastolic quiescent periods are
defined analogously, but with a center position occurring at or
later than 60% of the cycle. The mean and standard deviation
(σ) were then calculated for each subject for these features. As
representative examples for four subjects—two healthy and two
with cardiovascular disease—we plotted the composite velocity
magnitude signal sorted by instantaneous heart rate to visualize the effects of heart rate on the center position and duration
of diastolic and systolic quiescence for both populations (see
Fig. 4).
III. RESULTS
The identified quiescent periods and overall results for all
subjects are summarized numerically in Table I and graphically

in Fig. 5. From both, the duration of the diastolic periods (in
ms) can be seen to decrease with heart rate, while that of the
systolic periods is relatively independent of heart rate. These
results agree with those demonstrated by [15]. We found that
diastolic periods were linearly correlated (negatively) to heart
rate for both the healthy (r2 = 0.77, p < 0.01) subjects, and the
subjects with cardiovascular disease (r2 = 0.88, p < 0.01). Also
of note, the diastolic quiescent periods of the cardiac patients
are shorter than the healthy subjects as can be seen in Fig. 5.
In addition to beat-by-beat detection, quiescent periods were
identified for composite velocity magnitude signals using the
methods of Section II-C. For each subject, composite velocity
magnitude signals, v m (i) from (8), were generated for heart rate
range sets with a width of two beats per minute and 50% overlap
at one beat per minute increments. All v m (i) were normalized
to have a maximum of one. Examples of these composite velocity maps for two healthy subjects and two cardiac patients
are provided in Fig. 4 with the image intensity corresponding
to the velocity magnitude. Quiescent periods were identified for
each v m (i) and are indicated on the image in white. Each composite signal represents the average of all velocity magnitude
segments with an instantaneous heart rate within ±1 bpm of the
rate indicated.
From Fig. 4, the duration of the quiescent period during middiastole decreases as heart rate increases, whereas the duration

of the quiescent period during end-systole increases minimally
as heart rate increases. Also, the variability of the quiescent
periods for the cardiac patients appears larger, suggesting that
patient-specific gating parameters are even more important for
those with cardiac conditions and likely to receive cardiac CT
exams.
A preliminary comparison of cardiac CT reconstructions for
SCG- and ECG-predicted phases was made. ECG phases were
selected based on those suggested by Seifarth et al. in [16].
These heart-rate-dependent ECG phases are shown in Fig. 5
as gray dashed lines. The SCG phases were determined using
the method presented in Section II-C. Examples of cardiac CT
reconstructions from two patients showing the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) arteries are given in
Fig. 6. In these two examples, the SCG-predicted phases had
slightly higher image quality than the ECG-predicted phases. It
should be noted that the relationship between the optimal diagnostic CT phase relative to the center of the SCG-detected
quiescent periods is beyond the scope of the presented study.
IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
We have presented two methods to detect quiescent periods within cardiac cycles. The first, the beat-by-beat detection method, presented in Section II-B, can be used to detect

quiescence in real-time. The downside to this approach is that
it is prone to sensor noise and subject movement. The second
method, the composite signal method for detecting quiescent periods presented in Section II-C, relies on generating typical velocity magnitude signals for the range of heart rates observed for
each patient. By averaging many signals together, this method is
more robust at the expense of not being sensitive to beat-by-beat
variation in the motion of the chest wall.
Beat-by-beat detection can be used to observe quiescence
in real time with minimal delay. Although this method is sensitive to patient movement, the level of motion during a CT
exam should be less than observed in this study because the
patient is instructed to remain stationary and hold their breath.
Also, for this study, SCG data were recorded for roughly 30
min, whereas clinical CT data acquisition takes approximately
10 sec, allowing less time for patient motion. Because the beatby-beat method can detect quiescence in real time, it serves as
an important component of quiescence prediction from SCG
in real time. SCG could eventually replace the ECG entirely,
provided that cardiac cycles can be reliably detected from
the SCG alone, possibly by using segmentation techniques

developed for the phonocardiogram [17]–[19]. However, because the beat-by-beat stability of the SCG signal is not yet
proven, preliminary real-time gating strategies should focus on
a fusion of ECG and SCG techniques. The weighting of each
modality on the prescribed phase could depend on real-time
signal quality measures.
The observed inter and intrasubject variability of the quiescent period center with respect to the ECG suggests that ECG
may be a suboptimal predictor of cardiac quiescence. A phase
difference of 10% was shown to result in up to a 66% reduction
in the total number of diagnostic studies for the subject population in [20]. The potential of SCG-based gating for cardiac
CT to mitigate this reduction of diagnostic studies is an area of
further research.
Composite velocity magnitude signals can be used to robustly
detect the average quiescent periods for the range of heart rates
observed for each patient. This method is well suited for determining the optimal quiescent periods on average according
to the SCG. Thus, patient-specific quiescent phases (quiescent
period centers) can be obtained prior to a CTA examination and
then provided to the CT machine as gating parameters. However,
the performance of this type of patient-specific gating protocol
is heavily dependent on intrasubject cardiac cycle variability
because the composite signals are not sensitive to beat-by-beat
variation in the motion of the chest wall.
Both of the presented methods serve an important role in
the detection and prediction of cardiac quiescence. The beatby-beat detection methods can be used for real-time prediction, whereas the composite signal methods can be used
for offline prediction of cardiac quiescence. Although offline
methods are not as sensitive to beat-by-beat variability, they
are a necessary first step toward SCG-based gating because
they can be implemented without any change in CT machine
hardware.
It should be noted that the proposed SCG methods are primarily intended to improve prospectively gated CTA, unlike
retrospective CT-based quiescent phase identification methods
that require CT acquisition throughout the cardiac cycle [21]–
[23]. By acquiring imaging data only during a specific period of
the cardiac cycle, prospectively gated CTA results in much less
patient radiation exposure than retrospectively gated CTA. One
concern with prospectively gated CTA is that the most quiescent
phases have been shown to be artery dependent [24]–[26]. This
intervessel variation must be accounted for regardless of gating
method. Vembar et al. showed that the velocity of the RCA was
higher than any other vessel throughout the cardiac cycle [25].
Therefore, gating should occur during the most quiescent phase
of the RCA.
Lastly, although this study focuses on CTA, cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) also requires gating for phase registration. The use of MRI-compatible devices could allow for
SCG gating of cardiac MRI [27].
Future work will include assessing the accuracy of both the
beat-by-beat and composite velocity methods by comparing the
detected quiescent periods to those observed from CT data for
the same patients. Specifically, the relationship between the

SCG-derived velocity and the velocity of specific coronary vessels will be studied. In addition, the potential increase in CT
image quality resulting from more accurate gating needs to be
