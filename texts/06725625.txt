A Nonlinear Generalization of Spectral
Granger Causality
Fei He, Hua-Liang Wei, Stephen A. Billings∗ , and Ptolemaios G. Sarrigiannis

Abstract—Spectral measures of linear Granger causality have
been widely applied to study the causal connectivity between time
series data in neuroscience, biology, and economics. Traditional
Granger causality measures are based on linear autoregressive with
exogenous (ARX) inputs models of time series data, which cannot
truly reveal nonlinear effects in the data especially in the frequency
domain. In this study, it is shown that the classical Geweke’s spectral causality measure can be explicitly linked with the output
spectra of corresponding restricted and unrestricted time-domain
models. The latter representation is then generalized to nonlinear
bivariate signals and for the first time nonlinear causality analysis
in the frequency domain. This is achieved by using the nonlinear
ARX (NARX) modeling of signals, and decomposition of the recently defined output frequency response function which is related
to the NARX model.
Index Terms—Electroencephalogram (EEG), frequency response function (FRF), Granger causality, nonlinear systems, spectral analysis.

I. INTRODUCTION
RANGER causality [1] is a powerful approach for identifying causal relations among a set of time series data,
and has important applications in economics [2], neuroscience
[3]–[6], computational biology [7], [8], and many others.
Granger causality was originally developed in the context of
linear autoregressive with exogenous (ARX) input models, and
has been widely studied in the time domain. More recently,
since the frequency decompositions are of particular interest
for neurophysiological and biological data, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram recordings [3], [5], and
circadian rhythms in gene networks [8], several spectral measures related to Granger causality have been developed (for a
review see [9]), including Geweke’s spectral Granger causality [10], partial directed coherence [11], and directed transfer
function [12]–[15]. Most of these spectral measures are based on
time-domain linear-regression models; however, the interactions
between most real signals and processes are often nonlinear.

Hence, the classical linear model-based causality measures cannot truly reveal the nonlinear interactions within signals, especially in the frequency domain where linear methods would fail
to detect nonlinear effects such as harmonics, intermodulations
and energy transfer [16], [17]. Recently, the Granger causality definition has been extended to nonlinear bivariate cases in
the time domain, based on nonparametric methods [18], [19]
or parametric methods using, for example, radial basis functions [20], kernel methods [21], local linear systems [22], and
nonlinear ARX (NARX) models [23], [24]. However, it has not
yet been investigated in the frequency domain, and this is the
topic to be investigated in the present study.
In this paper, the time-domain linear Granger causality is
first reviewed and the nonlinear Granger causality based on the
NARX model is then introduced. Several elementary causality
(EC) measures are also proposed as an extension to the classical
Granger’s definition, which can measure the linear and nonlinear
causal effects from one process to the other individually. In the
frequency domain, Geweke’s spectral Granger causality method
is mainly investigated and it is demonstrated that Geweke’s
decomposition of the spectral matrix [4], [10] is equivalent to the
output spectra of corresponding restricted and unrestricted timedomain models. The latter interpretation is a straightforward
mapping of the time-domain linear causality definition. This
is generalized to nonlinear cases for the first time by mapping
the time-domain NARX model-based nonlinear causality and
EC formulations to the frequency domain, based on nonlinear
system frequency domain theory. The theories are illustrated
using a numerical example and a real human EEG recording.
II. TIME-DOMAIN FORMULATION OF LINEAR AND NONLINEAR
GRANGER CAUSALITY
The time-domain linear Granger causality with respect to bivariate signals is initially reviewed, and the extension to nonlinear signals and systems is then introduced based on parametric
NARX models.
A. Linear Granger Causality of Bivariate Time Series
Consider two signals (or stochastic processes) X and Y with
discrete time observations x(t) and y(t), t = 1, 2,. . ., N . Jointly,
the interactions of these two signals can be described by the
bivariate ARX models

where p and q are the model order of y and x regressors; ex (t)
and ey (t) are the model prediction errors, and each is assumed
serially uncorrelated over time. If the prediction error for a signal
depends only on the past of its own signal, this corresponds to a
univariate autoregressive (AR) model with only autoregressive
terms of x(t) or y(t), respectively, and a special case of (1) or
(2). The contemporaneous prediction error covariance matrix of
the ARX expression (1) and (2) is

where Σ11 = var(ex ), Σ22 = var(ey ), and Σ12 = Σ21 =

(ARX) models

from lagged input and
where x− and y − denote contributions
−
output terms, respectively; Σy22 denotes the variance of ey when
there are only regression terms of Y in the right-hand side of the
second equation in (1), which relates to a univariate AR model
of y(t). If the signal X has casual influence on the signal Y in the
Granger sense, the variance of the prediction error var(y|y − , x− )
must be smaller than var(y|y − ). The linear Granger causality
influence
FX →Y is then a positive value. Similarly, the causal
−
−
from Y to X can be defined as FY →X = ln Σx11 Σ11 , with Σx11
representing the variance of ex with only the regression terms
of X (i.e., a12,k = 0).
B. Nonlinear Granger Causality and Elementary Causalities
Classical Granger causality was formulated based on linear
AR or ARX models, and the direct application of this to nonlinear signals or systems will be inappropriate because nonlinear effects cannot be taken into account. Linear models can
never represent harmonics, intermodulations and complex energy transfer effects that characterize nonlinear systems. The
well-known NARX model [25] is a natural extension of the
ARX model and can describe a wide range of nonlinear dynamic systems; hence, NARX is an ideal basis for a nonlinear
Granger causality analysis. As an extension to the linear ARX
(2), the polynomial NARX model with respect to Y can be
expressed as
y(t) =

and are typically based on the forward regression with orthogonal least-squares (FROLS) method [25], [26]. By using the
FROLS algorithm, a “best” model structure is selected and the
model complexity is controlled to avoid over fitting, hence a
best model can be obtained. In addition, if the system under
study is linear, the FROLS method automatically discards the
nonlinear terms and only estimates a linear model. The identified model can be statistically validated using the nonlinear
correlation tests [25], [27]. Five cross-correlation functions,
i.e., φee (τ ), φxe (τ ), φe(ex) (τ ), φ(x 2 )  e (τ ), and φ(x 2 )  e 2 (τ ) (with
model residual e and (x2 ) a zero-mean process of x2 ), are used
in conjunction
with 95% confidence intervals (approximately
√
±1.96/ N ) to test whether the residuals are uncorrelated with
all linear and nonlinear combinations of past inputs, outputs, and
residuals. This validation routine is applied to examples in this
paper.
After modeling and identifying the nonlinear relationship between two time series using a NARX model (5), by denoting yl−
−
and x−
l as the lagged linear output and input terms, yn as all the
−
lagged nonlinear output terms, xn as all the lagged nonlinear
input terms, and (xy)−
n as all the lagged cross-product terms of
inputs and outputs, a total Granger causality from X to Y in a
nonlinear system can be defined as
Fx→y = ln

This is a natural extension to the Granger causality definition
of the linear case (4). Here, the numerator denotes the prediction error of a restricted model, which is a polynomial univariate
nonlinear AR (NAR) model of process Y and a special case of
the NARX expression (5) while the denominator corresponds
to the unrestricted NARX model (5). One important advantage
of using nonlinear modeling, especially the polynomial NARXbased approach, is that the linear and nonlinear causal influences
between two time series can be investigated individually. Such
decomposition is an extension to the classical Granger causality concept and can provide important insights into many real
applications, such as the linearity and nonlinearity detection in
human EEG [24]. More explicitly, two EC indices can be defined, which are the causal influences from linear input terms

effects from process X to Y . These EC indices do not strictly
follow the traditional Granger causality definition since different
linear and nonlinear terms from both processes are included in
the numerator and denominator. This is, however, unavoidable
here, because the individual (i.e., linear and nonlinear) causal
effects are investigated explicitly rather than an overall causal
influence from one process to the other. Nevertheless, the link

HE et al.: NONLINEAR GENERALIZATION OF SPECTRAL GRANGER CAUSALITY

between the traditional Granger causality index (6) with the EC
indices can be drawn. The former is not only a function of the
two EC indices given in (7) but also others. This is because in
a bivariate system (e.g., ARX or NARX), pure output related
model terms (i.e., yl− , yn− ) can also contribute to a total Granger
causality from X to Y, Fx→y . Such a causal effect is introduced
because the NARX (5) is a regression model and the current step
yn− (t) or yl− (t) will usually depend on the previous step input
terms, e.g., x−
l (t − 1). This effect obviously cannot be observed
in a restricted AR or NAR model.
As a result, the EC index that measures the causal influences
from nonlinear output terms yn− to y can be defined as

var(y|yl− , x−

var(y|yl− , x−
l , yn , xn , (xy)n )
	

= h Fyn(e)→y , Fyn(x)→y .

Fyn→y = ln

(8)

Importantly, the influences of nonlinear output terms yn− to
the process Y can be divided into two parts. One is an intrinsic
effect which relates to the restricted univariate NAR structure in
the model as given in the numerator of (6). This effect is only
driven by the model prediction error ey that can be regarded
as an extra input to the system, and is denoted Fyn(e)→y . The
other is a causal effect that is introduced by the input process X
due to the regression process, and is denoted Fyn(x)→y . Such a
dual-effect, however, cannot be directly quantified (i.e., Fyn(e)→y
and Fyn(x)→y cannot be explicitly expressed) in the time domain,
because the nonlinear output terms yn− cannot be divided into two
separate parts as yn−(e) and yn−(x) , although conceptually it should
be. Nevertheless, in the frequency domain such a dual-effect to
the spectrum can be quantified and explicitly formulated, which
will be investigated in the next section.
Similarly, the EC index that measures the causal influences
from linear output terms
to process Y also

	 contains two effects,
that is, Fyl →y = h Fyl (e)→y , Fyl (x)→y . As a result, the total
Granger causality from X to Y, Fx→y , contains not only the
contributions from linear and nonlinear input terms, but also the
“causal” contributions from linear and nonlinear output terms.
The relationship between classical Granger causality and elementary causalities can, therefore, be described as

	
l
n
, Fx→y
, Fyl (x)→y , Fyn(x)→y .
(9)
Fx→y = f Fx→y
Here f (·) is a nonlinear function, and it describes that the
total causality from process X to Y depends on four elementary
effects. Although it is difficult to explicitly express f (·), such
a decomposition and interpretation is crucial in the frequency
domain analysis and formulation of the corresponding Granger
and EC indices. Similarly, the linear and nonlinear causalities
from y to x can also be defined by exchanging the input and
output roles of two time series in (5)–(9).
III. FREQUENCY-DOMAIN FORMULATION OF
NONLINEAR CAUSALITY
In this section, the frequency-domain analysis of causality for
linear systems is first introduced in Section III-A. Importantly,

1695

we demonstrate the equivalence of the classical spectral matrix
decomposition method with the approach of using spectra of the
corresponding restricted and unrestricted model outputs. The
latter approach is extended to causality analysis for nonlinear
systems. The frequency-domain analysis of nonlinear systems
based on parametric NARMAX models is introduced in Section
III-B, and a new frequency-domain formulation of causality for
nonlinear bivariate signals is proposed in Section III-C.
A. Linear Causality in the Frequency Domain

= A11 (f )/det(A), Gxy (f ) = −A12 (f )/det(A), and Gy x (f ) =
−A21 (f )/det(A). Following the treatment in [5] and [6], the
spectral matrix S can then be defined as



Sxx (f ) Sxy (f )
∗
(12)
S(f ) = G(f )ΣG (f ) =
Sy x (f ) Sy y (f )
where ∗ denotes complex conjugation and matrix transposition. To obtain the frequency decomposition of the time-domain
causality defined in Section II-A, the autospectrum of Y can be
expressed based on Geweke’s transformation [10]
Sy y (f ) = G̃y y (f )Σ22 G̃∗y y (f ) + Gy x (f )Σ̃11 G∗y x (f ).

(13)

Here, the first term is interpreted as the “intrinsic” power
or contribution from y in frequency, and the second term is the
“causal” power from x. More specifically, G̃y y (f ) = Gy y (f ) +
(Σ12 /Σ22 )Gy x (f ) and Σ̃11 = Σ11 − (Σ212 /Σ22 ). When there
is no instantaneous causality [9], [10], [28] Σ12 = 0 and the
interdependence between x(t) and y(t) is entirely based on the
interactions through the regression terms on the right-hand sides
of (1) and (2). In such a case G̃y y (f ) = Gy y (f ) and Σ̃11 = Σ11 .
This is the assumption considered in this study including the
nonlinear case to be discussed in the following sections. Based
on (13) and assuming Σ12 = 0, the causal influence from x to
y at frequency f can be defined as [9], [10]
Sy y (f )
.
(14)
IX →Y (f ) = ln
Gy y (f )Σ22 G∗y y (f )
The causality is expressed in terms of intrinsic power so that
the causal influence is zero when the causal power is zero, as
the intrinsic power equals the total power. As the causal power
increases the intrinsic power decreases, and the causality would
increase. The causal influence from Y to X, IY →X (f ), can
be expressed in a similar way by analyzing the expression of

1696

Sxx (f ). The above presents the classical spectral matrix decomposition method, while the frequency-domain causality can also
be directly computed from the output spectra of the corresponding time-domain unrestricted (ARX) and restricted (AR) models. The latter method can be regarded as a direct mapping of the
time-domain causality formulation and is a more promising approach that can be extended to the nonlinear frequency-domain
causality analysis. The equivalence of these two methods is
summarized in Proposition 1.
Proposition 1: The frequency-domain formulation of causal
influence from X to Y (14) based on spectra matrix decomposition is equivalent to the following:

 y |y l− 

The aforementioned dual-effect of linear output terms y −
to process Y can also be quantified and observed in the
frequency-domain decomposition (16). The intrinsic effect is
only driven by the model prediction error ey , therefore strictly
Yy |y − (f ) = Yy |y (−e ) (f ) in (16). The causal effect Yy |y (−x ) (f ) is
actually integrated into the FRF Hx→y (f ) of the ARX model,
because Hx→y (f ) depends on parameters of the linear output
terms a22,i . Equation (15) provides another way of computing
the causality in the frequency domain. Importantly, the output
power spectra defined in the numerator and denominator of
(15) are directly related to the corresponding unrestricted and
restricted models in the time-domain causality expression (4).
This new approach can be generalized to nonlinear systems and
nonlinear causality analysis, and such direct mapping between
time and frequency domain causalities can still be preserved.

The numerator is the power (or auto) spectrum of Y , which
corresponds to an unrestricted ARX expression (1) of Y in the
time domain. Yy |y − (f ) denotes the spectrum of Y given only
past observations of Y , which relates to a univariate AR model
with all the coefficients of the X terms set to zero. Yy |x − (f )
denotes the contribution from process X to the spectrum of Y .
Proof: Since the spectral matrix (12) is actually the inner
product of the input and output spectrum vector with its transposition, i.e., S(f ) = Z(f )Z ∗ (f ) where Z(f ) = [X(f ) Y (f )]T ,
the autospectrum of y can be directly computed from Sy y (f ) =
Y (f )Y ∗ (f ). Since the instantaneous causality is not considered
here and Σ12 = 0, it is assumed that a12,k = 0 in (1) when we
investigate IX →Y (f ). As a result, detA(f ) = A11 (f )A22 (f ).
The autospectrum of Y, Sy y (f ), can then be expressed as

This indicates the “intrinsic” part is equal to the power spectrum of Y with only the contribution from past y observations,
which corresponds to a standard formulation of the AR model
spectrum of Y . The “causal” part is essentially the output spectrum of the linear ARX model (2), which is the product of
the frequency response function (FRF) Hx→y (f ) and the input spectrum Xx|x − (f ) according to linear system theory, and
the input spectrum can be computed from the corresponding
AR model of X. The sum of the “intrinsic”
and “causal”
parts

become an overall power spectrum Yy |y − ,x − (f ) . For cases
where a12,k = 0, an extra term, i.e., −A12 (f )A21 (f )/A11 (f ),
would be present in the denominators in (16). This scenario is
not investigated in this study and will be the future work.


Before defining new frequency-domain nonlinear Granger
causality indices, it is important to introduce the frequencydomain analysis of a nonlinear system, especially the NARX
model-based analysis. It is well known that the output spectrum
of a linear time invariant system Y (f ) is equal to the product
of the input spectrum X(f ) with the system FRF, i.e., Y (f )
= H(f )X(f ). The frequency-domain analysis of a nonlinear
system is much more complicated, and mainly based on the
generalized FRFs (GFRFs) that extend the linear FRF to higher
orders and dimensions. Following the derivations in [29], the
output spectrum of a nonlinear system can be formulated via
the output FRF (OFRF)
Y (f ) =

Here, the nth-order GFRF Hn (f1 ,. . .,fn ) was defined as the
multiple Fourier transform of the nth-order Volterra kernel, and
later extended to the NARX model cases [16], [30]. For a NARX
model, the corresponding nth-order GFRF can be expressed in
terms of the model parameters from (5) as
Hn (f1 , . . . , fn ) =
Hn [x] (f1 , . . . , fn ) + Hn [y ] (f1 , . . . , fn ) + Hn [xy ] (f1 , . . . , fn )

The above recursion finishes with p = 1, where the

Hn ,1 (f1 , . . . , fn ) = Hn (f1 , . . . , fn )e−j 2π (f 1 +···+f i )k 1 /f s .
(21)
The OFRF formulation (17) defines the output spectrum Y (f )
of a nonlinear system given the input spectrum X(f ). This will
form the most important part in the causality analysis of a nonlinear bivariate system, and is essentially a nonlinear generalization of the “causal” power Yy |x − (f ) defined in the linear case.
The OFRF was originally defined based on the NARX model (5)
without considering the additive model error ey (t) [30], which,
however, needs to be taken into account in the causality analysis
that will be discussed in Section III-C.
C. Nonlinear Granger and Elementary Causalities
From Section III-A, the frequency-domain formulation of
linear Granger causality can be expressed in terms of either a
spectral matrix decomposition or the spectra of the corresponding restricted and unrestricted model outputs. When discussing
the nonlinear causality in the frequency domain, the former approach based on a spectral matrix cannot be directly applied,
because the GFRFs of a nonlinear system (18) can be multidimensional in terms of frequency and the relationship between
the spectra of x and y with the error terms is not linear. Therefore, in this section, the latter approach is employed and is
generalized to the nonlinear causality analysis in frequency.
In parallel with the power spectrum decomposition in linear
systems (16), the power spectrum of y with respect to a nonlinear
NARX model (5) also consists of two parts, i.e., an error driven
part and a input process driven part

Here the first term is the “intrinsic” power that denotes the
output spectrum of the restricted NAR model, and only driven

by the model error ey . The second term is the “causal” power
that only driven by the input process X, and corresponds to the
OFRF (17) of a noise-free NARX model that can be regarded as
a replacement to the linear response function Yy |x − (f )in (16).
Importantly, the dual effects in the linear and nonlinear output
terms yl− and yn− can now be separated and quantified in the frequency domain. Explicitly, the contributions to the “intrinsic”
−
and yn−(e) , while the contributions to
power are denoted as yl(e)
−
the “causal” power are denoted as yl(x)
and yn−(x) . Because the
causal effects from linear output terms, Yy |y − (f ), are implicl(x )
itly integrated in the GFRFs (18), it is not explicitly expressed
in (22). Now, the “intrinsic” part can be expressed by treating
the error as an input in the NAR model
Yy |y l−( e ) ,y n− ( e ) (f ) = Yy |y l−( e ) (f ) + Yy |y n− ( e ) (f )

noise, the power spectrum can be approximated by the variance
E(f ) = E(fi ) = var(ey ), and the AR model spectrum (16)
becomes a special case of (23).

to (17) and (18), with D(f1 ,. . .,fn ) denoting the denominator

This is a direct result of the OFRF formulation (17) as the additive relationship among different linear and nonlinear components in the GFRFs, and the latter can be split into contributions
from pure input, output, and cross-product terms. Such additive
relationship will greatly facilitate the definition of nonlinear
causality indices in the frequency domain.

Practically, in order to reduce the interactions and influences
from other “redundant” model terms to the spectral causality
definition and visualization, the simplified EC definitions are
introduced here. The simplified causalities are computed by setting the parameter estimates of the ‘redundant’ terms in the
identified NARX model to be zeros, rather than re-estimating
those parameters from simplified model expressions. For instance, the frequency components introduced from pure nonlinear output terms Yy |y n− (f ) are removed from both the denominan
tor and the numerator when analyzing IX
→Y (f ), because these
frequency components can often overlap with the components
introduced from Yy |x −n (f ) or Yy |(xy ) −n (f ) and therefore affect
the accuracy of causality in practice. Similar to the decomposition of the causal part in (24), the terms Yy |x −l ,x −n ,(xy ) −n (f )
and Yy |x −l ,y n−( x ) ,(xy ) −n (f ) can also be decomposed as the sum
of corresponding linear and nonlinear terms given in (25). By
computing the three spectral elementary causalities, the linear
and nonlinear causal influences from process X to Y can be
visualized in the frequency domain.
IV. SIMULATION AND APPLICATION
In this section, an artificial data set generated from a simulated
discrete-time nonlinear system and a real human EEG data set

are given as examples to illustrate the proposed NARX modelbased frequency-domain nonlinear causality analysis.
A. Numerical Example
A large variety of continuous-time or discrete-time nonlinear
dynamic processes can be described by the NARX models [31],
[25]. Here, two time series are generated; their interactions are
described by a representative NARX process with nonlinearities
in both input and output terms:
⎧
⎪
⎨ y(k) = 0.5y(k − 1) − 0.3y(k − 2) + 0.1x(k − 2)
+0.1y(k − 2)2 + 0.4x(k − 1)x(k − 2) + ey (k)
⎪
⎩
x(k) = sin(2 × 2πk) + sin(3 × 2πk) + ex (k)
(28)
where ey (k) and ex (k) were additive Gaussian, white measurement noise sequences with zero mean and variance of 0.0025
and 0.0004. The input x(k) was sampled at frequency fs =
20 Hz. By simulating (28), the input and output sequences are
generated with 600 time points. The NARX model structure was
then identified, the parameters were estimated using a FROLS
algorithm [25], [26], and the model was validated using the correlation test [27]. Based on the identified time-domain model,
the first-, second-, and third-order GFRFs can be computed

this example due to the nonlinear output terms in the NARX
model, for illustration the GFRFs only up to third order were
computed here. The input spectrum X(f ) was computed by
first fitting a tenth-order AR model and then mapping it into the
frequency domain according to (16), i.e., X(f ) = Xx|x − (f ).
Given the input spectrum and GFRFs in (29), the output

spectrum Y (f ) can be computed according (17). The modelbased input and output spectra X(f ) and Y (f ) (Fig. 1) show
that the input spectrum has two frequency components at f1 =
2 and f2 = 3 Hz, while many more frequency components are
identified in the output spectrum Y (f ). This is due to the strong
intermodulation and harmonic effects [16]. To further investigate how the linear and nonlinear terms in the NARX model
contribute to these frequency components in Y (f ), different
EC indices were computed according to (27), and are shown in
Fig. 2.
l
The linear causality spectrum IX
→Y (f ) shows that the linear
x terms in the nonlinear model will only introduce the fundamental frequency components (i.e., at 2 and 3 Hz) to the output
spectrum Y (f ). The second-order nonlinear x term introduces
intermodulation frequencies up to second order in the output
n
spectrum; therefore, the nonlinear causality IX
→Y (f ) contains
frequencies at 2f1 = 4 Hz, f1 + f2 = 5 Hz, 2 f2 = 6 Hz, f2 − f1
= 1 Hz, f1 − f1 = 0 Hz, and f2 − f2 = 0 Hz. Nevertheless, the
second-order nonlinear y term will introduce not only second
(i.e., at 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6 Hz) but also higher order intermodulation frequencies (e.g., at 7, 8, and 9 Hz) in the output spectrum
as shown in the causality IYn (X )→Y (f ). This is due to the y
related nonlinearity which can iteratively propagate in the nonlinear system and therefore produce second and higher order
GFRFs in the frequency domain, such as (29), and can result in
theory in an infinite number of harmonics and intermodulation
frequencies. As a comparison, if the classical spectral Granger
causality measure (14) is applied by using linear ARX model to
fit the data, the nonlinear causal effects and the intermodulation
components will never be revealed. This is because the input
and output frequency components of a linear system are always
the same (i.e., at 2 and 3 Hz in this example), and hence only the

B. Application to Intracranial EEG Data
EEG signals are known to exhibit strong nonlinear effects
[32]. In this example, a part of an intracranial EEG recording
will be used to demonstrate that the NARX model and proposed
nonlinear causality measures can well capture the linear and
nonlinear interactions in real data set. The EEG signals were
recorded in two intracranial channels with a sampling rate of
250 Hz. One is measured in the left brain (i.e., left subtemporal
contacts, LsubT2-LsubT3), and the other is in the right brain
(i.e., RsubT2-RsubT3). For illustration and to reduce the order
of the model, the raw data were down sampled to 125 Hz; the
data were also normalized by subtracting the mean value from
each signal to remove the bias effect. From our collaborator at
Sheffield Teaching Hospital, it is known that this EEG dataset
is measured from an epileptic patient, and the time series data
shown in Fig. 3 contain an epileptic seizure starting from the
right side of the brain with fast frequencies (30–50 Hz) several
seconds before it spreads to the other side of the brain, around
62 s. When focal seizures spread into both left and right brain
areas around 67 s, high amplitudes and strong synchronization
phenomena can be observed. These are strong evidence from
magnetic resonance imaging shows right hippocampal sclerosis
as well as the clinical semiology during the patient’s seizures
further supports a right temporal epilepsy.
To analysis this nonstationary dataset using the time invariant
causality analysis, the dataset is divided into two segments:
the early onset stage (58–67 s) and the seizure spreading stage
(67–76 s). The spectra of both sides EEG at these two stages are
shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen at the first stage the left brain EEG
has relatively slow periodic oscillations around 3 Hz because of
seizure onset. The right brain EEG, however, contains not only
the low-frequency components, but also some components at
higher frequencies, i.e., between 30–50 Hz. The differences
in frequency components between the two indicate there may
exist nonlinear interactions. At the seizure spreading stage, only
low-frequency components with high amplitude are observed in

To further assist understanding and visualization of the aforesaid
statement, the time–frequency spectra of both EEG signals are
provided in Fig. 5 by using the recent proposed nonstationary
parametric approach [33], although in this study nonstationary
modeling and analysis will not be discussed.
To analysis whether these different frequency components
in the right brain are introduced by linear or nonlinear causal
effects, the left brain EEG is first treated as an input signal
X, and approximated by a univariate AR model with maximum
lags of 15. The right brain EEG then becomes the output process
Y , and can be modeled by a NARX model with second-order
nonlinearity and maximum lags of 6 in both input and output
terms. By using the proposed model identification and frequency
domain mapping approach, the frequency elementary causalities
can be computed and are shown in Fig. 6.

brain. The nonlinear causalities IX

nonlinear effects before and during the seizure spreading from
right to left. The influences from nonlinear input and output

terms to the right EEG signal are similar in profile indicating
the nonlinear cross-product terms have important contribution to
the output spectra. During the seizure spreading stage, because
of the strong synchronization linear causal effects are dominant
at low frequencies, while the nonlinear effects are weak. For
comparison, the causalities from the opposite direction were
also computed by treating the right EEG as the input and left
EEG as the output, and shown in Fig. 7.
The causality analysis from the opposite direction also identifies strong nonlinear effects at the early onset stage. The nonlinear causalities are mainly at low frequency range indicating
the low frequency oscillations in the left EEG are introduced
by both linear and nonlinear interactions from the right EEG,
while the linear causalities are still dominate when the seizures
spread into both left and right brain areas.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, Geweke’s power spectral decomposition method
has been generalized for the first time to nonlinear causality
analysis in the frequency domain, based on NARX modeling
and corresponding nonlinear frequency-domain analysis theory. This development is important for real data analysis, because most physiological and biological systems are nonlinear
in nature, and the corresponding time series measurements can
exhibit nonlinear interactions especially in the frequency domain. Therefore, existing linear causality analysis will fail to
reveal these nonlinear effects and may provide misleading results. It is known that the conventional linear Granger causality
can be extended to multivariate, conditional, and time-varying
cases [9], [23], [35]. In this paper, only the bivariate pairwise
causality for stationary nonlinear processes has been investigated. However, based on the frequency-domain theory of multivariate nonlinear systems [34] and recent results on nonstationary nonlinear systems [33], these extensions can also be
developed for the nonlinear systems. Instantaneous causality
is not explicitly considered in this study. For cases where a
common input needs to be taken into account, off-diagonal elements in the covariance matrix need to be employed in the
causality formulation, and its generalization to the nonlinear
cases will be studied in the future. In this study, we mainly consider a class of mildly nonlinear systems that can be represented
by Volterra or NARX models [25]. The causality analysis of
severely nonlinear systems, such as subharmonic systems, requires different modeling and frequency domain analysis methods and will be studied in the future work.
