Abstract—This paper describes a patient-specific mathematical model to predict the evolution of uterine cervical tumors at
a macroscopic scale, during fractionated external radiotherapy.
The model provides estimates of tumor regrowth and dead-cell reabsorption, incorporating the interplay between tumor regression
rate and radiosensitivity, as a function of the tumor oxygenation
level. Model parameters were estimated by minimizing the difference between predicted and measured tumor volumes, these latter
being obtained from a set of 154 serial cone-beam computed tomography scans acquired on 16 patients along the course of the
therapy. The model stratified patients according to two different
estimated dynamics of dead-cell removal and to the predicted initial value of the tumor oxygenation. The comparison with a simpler
model demonstrated an improvement in fitting properties of this
approach (fitting error average value <5%, p < 0.01), especially in
case of tumor late responses, which can hardly be handled by models entailing a constant radiosensitivity, failing to model changes
from initial severe hypoxia to aerobic conditions during the treatment course. The model predictive capabilities suggest the need of
clustering patients accounting for cancer cell line, tumor staging,
as well as microenvironment conditions (e.g., oxygenation level).

radiotherapy (RT) clinical practice, as it potentially discloses insights about the interplay amongst cell killing, oxygenation, and
tumor regrowth [1]–[6]. Microscopic models are able to realistically mimic biological phenomena at cellular and molecular
levels, but their translation into clinical practice is not straightforward. The main reason is that the clinical data necessary
to estimate model parameters on a patient-specific basis require nonelective, invasive, and expensive experimental procedures. As a consequence, treatment dose prescription and fractionation strategies still stem from consolidated general guidelines, failing to account for patient-specific response to radiation
therapy [7].
In this perspective, many modeling efforts have been described for the investigation of simple models at a macroscopic
scale in predicting tumor volume evolution in response to different radiotherapy schedules [8]–[10]. Results showed that model
parameters can be successfully linked to both morphologic and
functional data, at the voxel level, obtained from measurements
coming from image-guidance techniques applied for interfraction uncertainties assessment [11]–[13].
The majority of the proposed models, based on either exponential, logistic, or Gompertzian laws and the linear-quadratic
exponential (LQ) function, were applied to represent tumor
growth and radioresponsiveness [5]. Noteworthy, promising fitting results were reported when models were trained with in vivo
tumor volume regression data, measured in magnetic resonance
images (MRI), for glioblastoma [14] and uterine cervical cancer
[15]. Alternative modeling approaches were based on ordinary
differential equation (ODE) and partial differential equation and
included dead/inactivated cell kinetics [14], the effects of oxygenation [1], [3], [15], [16], and different microenvironment
conditions [12]. Early studies reported that the radioresponsiveness of homogenous cell lines can sensibly vary as a function of
many factors, such as cancer volume size, level of oxygenation,
vascularization, and delivered dose [17], [18], with a general
consensus that the larger the volume size is, the smaller the cell
killing rate is expected to be, due to larger hypoxia effects [19].
Furthermore, it was shown that reoxygenation may occur because of tumor shrinkage, decreased oxygen consumption, and
increased perfusion [15], [16].
Here, we present an ODE system that incorporates Gompertzian growth of the viable cells and dead-cell exponential decay kinetics, along with a differential dynamics of the oxygenation level, as a function of the viable volume variation. We tested
the capability of the model in fitting different tumor regression

For two patients (∗) a larger CBCT dataset was available. (TMN staging T1bN0M0 to
T1bN1M1 corresponding to FIGO staging IB to IVB)

schemes in response to fractionated RT. Model parameters were
learned on a patient-specific basis, using serial tumor volume
measurements coming from a dataset of 154 cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) acquisitions on 16 uterine cervical
cancer patients, who underwent radiotherapy or concomitant
chemo/radiotherapy. The tumor radiosensitivity was assumed
to be directly dependent on the oxygenation level, whereas drug
effects were not explicitly modeled but supposed to enhance
tumor responsiveness.
II. EXPERIMENTAL DATA
Sixteen female patients, diagnosed with locally advanced
uterine cervical cancer using the International Federation of
Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging approach, were retrospectively included in the study (see Table I).
Five patients (mean age: 46) affected by adenocarcinoma
(ADC) received external RT along with chemotherapy (ChT)
(Cisplatin, Paclitaxel); ChT was administrated once a week for
5 or 6 cycles. Five patients (mean age: 52) were affected by
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and received external RT and
concomitant ChT (Cisplatin, Paclitaxel) with prescription and
drug schedule comparable to the previous patients. Six patients
(mean age: 83) were affected by SCC and were treated with
external RT only, because of the higher toxicity risks associated
with chemotherapy agents, due to the older age. After external radiotherapy, all patients underwent internal brachytherapy.
Patients were treated during the 2010–2012 period at the European Institute of Oncology (EIO, Milan, Italy). Among the
observed patients, Patient 3, who was treated between February
and March 2011, deceased after 13 months for pulmonary complications; Patient 5, treated between July and August 2011,
died due to stroke few months after the end of the treatment. All
other patients survived up to 24-month follow-up.

Fig. 1.

Axial scan of the planning CT with segmented tumor.

Tumor volumes were segmented on treatment planning CT
and daily CBCT imaging acquired for image guidance. Tumor
extents were assessed at the time of treatment planning guidelines and were found in the range of about 3–4 cm (equivalent
diameter), corresponding to a mean volume of 23.7 cm3 (range:
12.6–44.4 cm3 ). Patients were imaged and treated in supine position and fitted with a Combifix (CIVCO Medical Solutions,
Kalona, IA, USA) immobilization device: mean bladder volume at the time of treatment planning was 400 cm3 (range
145–630 cm3 ). All patients received up to 50.4 Gy in approximately 25 fractions, along a period of 60 days (see Table I).
An average period of 15 days elapsed from CT acquisition to
the first treatment fraction for plan elaboration. At each irradiation, patient setup was verified by means of a kV CBCT system
(voxel size: 0.87 × 0.87 × 3 mm3 ) integrated in the treatment
machine (Trilogy, VARIAN medical systems, Palo Alto, CA,
USA); setup corrections were performed according to the EIO
institutional setup verification and action level protocols. The
gross tumor volume (see Fig. 1) was manually contoured on a
subset of the acquired CBCT scans by an expert radiation oncologist (see Fig. 1). After external radiotherapy, 4–5 sessions
of internal brachytherapy (3–4 Gy per session) were delivered
to all patients.
III. MATHEMATICAL MODELING
A. Modeling Cancer Growth and Response
to Radiation Therapy
The overall detectable tumor morphology along the treatment
entails the contribution of both viable and dead cells [20]. In a
solid, homogeneously irradiated tumor exhibiting radial evolution, the cell density can be replaced by the tumor volume [21].
The Gompertz function G (1) represents the spontaneous growth
of the active volume Vv [14].

G = Vv (t) = ke(log ( k )e

(1)

where ρ and k are the growth rate and growth saturation factor
of the volume (tissue carrying capacity), respectively. The effect
of the delivery of a single radiation dose di , can be expressed

as the survival fraction Si (2), which depends upon the tissue
radiosensitivity parameters, α (Gy−1 ) and β (Gy−2 ), through the
LQ model [22].
Si = e−(α d i +β d i ) .
2

(2)

Along with active volume response, the inactive volume portion increases by (1 − Si ) contribution and undergoes reabsorption according to a time-dependent process, that can be modeled as an exponential decay with half-time constant T1/2 . If
one considers N radiation fractions, the active (Vv ) and necrotic
(Vd ) volumes dynamics can be written as follows (3a), (3b):

where γ (day−1 ) represents a time normalization factor (set to
unitary value) and h (Si , t) (3c) is the tumor cell mortality rate,
which accounts for the instantaneous radiation effect at time ti
for the dose di , and is modeled as a Dirac delta function.
The resulting ODE system can be solved by subdividing the
total time into a series of N subintervals and by iterating over
i, from the time ti of ith fraction to the time ti+1 corresponding to the following irradiation session. In order to account for
evidences that RT-induced cell impairment does not occur instantaneously [6], [23], [24], we modified the delta function
δ (t − ti ) in (3c) with an explicit exponential decay over time
of the unit-less effective dose Di = αdi + βd2i . The resulting
differential equations to be solved at each iteration is, therefore

We termed this model formulation (4a), (4b) as Ms. Its novelty with respect to previous similar modeling approaches [7],
[14] is that it interprets an instantaneous viable volume reduction at the time of irradiation (t = ti ), in agreement with the LQ
model, coupled with a lower cell killing capability over time.
The drawback is that Ms produces an infinite response to each
system perturbation (irradiation), eventually leading to estimate
a complete tumor control, even with a single dose. It is important to stress that this cannot be the case according to our
clinical dataset if one considers that: 1) the dataset comes from
quite uniform treatment schedules with short breaks between
fractions; 2) the contribution of previous dose delivery fractions
can be considered negligible at the time of a new irradiation
session.
B. Oxygenation Model
There is a general consensus that tumor volume shrinkage
frees biological resources, including oxygen [25]. Conversely,

tumor growth decreases the oxygen concentration pO2 (oxygen
partial pressure, mmHg) within the tumor mass. When oxygen
consumption exceeds the physiological supply, the tumor starts
to become hypoxic. It is well known that hypoxia decreases
radioresponsiveness [16] and one can argue that larger tumors,
being partially hypoxic, may contain a higher fraction of hypoxic
radioresistant cells than smaller tumors. It is, thus, realistic that
large tumors feature a lower mean radiosensitivity than small
tumors. According to these considerations, we hypothesized
an inverse relation between pO2 concentration and the viable
volume size variation and a direct relation between pO2 and
radiosensitivity.
It is reasonable to assume that the oxygenation level of a
tumor cannot overcome the general cellular aerobic condition
corresponding to 60 mmHg1 [3]. The differential relation between pO2 and viable volume size can be written as a Gompertz
function (5).

pO
dpO2

pO2
2 are the evolution rate and the maximum level
where λ and pO
of oxygenation, respectively. The inverse differential relationship between pO2 and Vv is implemented by modulating the
2 in such a way that as the viable volume decreases, the
pO
oxygenation level saturation increases. The modulation factor
v
f (Vv ) = ( V kv−V
(t=0) ) depends on the tumor carrying capacity and
is always lower than 1, in order to ensure that the maximum sat2 is never reached. The formulation of f (Vv ) allows
uration pO
to cope with both increasing and decreasing oxygenation levels.
The initial level of pO2 at the beginning of the treatment is in
principle unknown and must be derived from patient-specific diagnostic and/or experimental measurements or estimated from
tumor regression data along with other free parameters.
Assuming a linear dependence of the radiosensitivity upon
oxygenation level, the α term introduced in (2) can be expressed
in terms of pO2 as follows:
α (pO2 ) = αm in +

pO2
(α
− αm in )
2 m ax
pO

(6)

where the αm in (0.05 Gy−1 ) and αm ax (0.6 Gy−1 ) represent
the α range [7], [26]. With respect to the concept of oxygen
enhancement ratio (OER) introduced in [16] to model the radiosensitization due to increasing oxygen level, we defined OER
as the ratio of the radiation dose under hypoxic condition over
the radiation dose required to have the same biological effect in
aerobic condition. Under the hypothesis that a small dose per
fraction is delivered, the radiosensitivity parameter of the LQ
αa
, where one could even
model can be rewritten as α (t) = OER
consider multiple classes of tumor viable cells as a function of
a discrete set of oxygenation level. It must be noted that αa
is a crucial parameter that rules model estimation capabilities.
Its value needs to be defined a priori and independently from
pO2 (0), making the overall model strictly dependent on that
value.

partial pressure of pO2 in air is about 160 mmHg (21%).

C. Patient-Specific Model
Free model parameters were learned on patient-specific basis
using an iterative optimization technique based on genetic algorithms. This learning procedure, implemented in MATLAB
(Mathworks, USA), estimated the parameters by minimizing
the difference between predicted and measured volume data on
CBCT. ρ (day−1 ), k (cm3 ), pO2 (t = 0) (mmHg) and λ (day−1 )
were bounded by 0.01 < ρ < 0.5, Vv (t = 0) < k < 1.25 ×
Vv (t = 0), 0% < pO2 (0) < 100%, 0.01 < λ < 0.5. The k
value, representing the maximal carrying capacity, was forced
to be greater than the initial tumor size. Dealing with nonsmall cancer lesions, a maximal increase of 25% with respect
to Vv (t = 0) was allowed. This choice was supported by the
available data presenting a limited volume increase even when
no therapy was administered. The use of Gompertzian growth,
however, prevented a direct comparison of ρ parameters to the
standard doubling time. In this scenario, considering the average initial tumor volume of the patients (Vtot = Vv ∼ 23 cm3 ),
ρ range was selected to limit the maximal spontaneous growth
(corresponding to k = 1.25 × Vv and ρ = 0.5) within 10% of
Vv after one day. As far as pO2 (0) is concerned, percentage
values were selected with respect to the reference value of
60 mmHg (100%) according to [3]. Finally, since it was not
possible to compute an analytic solution for the pO2 (5), λ was
allowed to span within a wide range accounting for a rough
effect summation of the different phenomena influencing tumor
reoxygenation [14], [15].
Concerning the remaining model parameters not involved in
the optimization procedure, τS was set as a unitary constant,
due to the quite homogenous fractionation in all patients. T1/2 ,
which was not estimated in bundle with the other parameters as
proposed in [7], underwent a sensitivity analysis, by means of

599

which its optimal value among six constant values (0.1, 0.5, 1,
2, 5, and 10 days) [7] was selected.
The fitness measure for the optimization procedure was defined as the root mean squared (RMS) error ek of the differences
between the predicted and measured tumor data, considering all
tumor segmentations performed on each specific patient

where ek ,m = (vk ,m − v̄k ,m ) is the difference between the predicted and measured tumor size and Nk is the number of segmented tumor volumes for patient k.
At the time t = 0, the algorithm generated random population
of 150 different parameter sets and the differential equation system was solved at each radiation time interval (ti , ti+1 ) for each
of the parameter set. According to the fitness results, a subset
of the population was selected for replication through crossover
(recombination rate: 0.4) and mutation (mutation rate: 0.35)
for the generation of new population at the following iteration
step. The process was iterated until the percentage variance of
the parameter set, computed across a short iteration span (25),
was higher than a threshold quantity ε (1%). In order to avoid
premature convergence, a minimum number of iterations (200)
was imposed. For comparison among the different initial volume sizes across patients, the percentage fitting error (9) was
applied.

D. Experimental Protocol for Fitting Quality Validation and
Parameter Interplay Analysis
The validation was performed according to different strategies and metrics: 1) we assessed the interplay of the dead-cell
kinetics with tumor growth rate and pO2 for each patient by
considering the Mt associated to the T1/2 value that provided
the minimum fitting error [see Section III-C and (9)]; 2) we
rated the role of oxygenation dynamics, by comparing the Mt
fitting quality with the one featured by the simplified model Ms,
which disregarded the pO2 and estimated the parameter α in the
optimization procedure along with ρ and k [see Section III-A
and (4a) and (4b)]; 3) we tested the model robustness through a
linear sensitivity analysis (LSA) of the free parameters, which
were perturbed independently up to 25% of its estimated value;
this test was performed on the complete volume datasets of
patients 5 and 16 (see Table I); 4) we verified the predictive
capability of the model by applying two of the model parameters estimated on a definite patient (patients 5 and 16 complete
dataset) to compute the fitting error for all the remaining patients. All the statistical comparisons were carried out by means
of the Mann–Whitney U test or Wilcoxon signed rank test with
a significance level of 5%.

(4.5%) and exhibited a wider variability range (2.3%–15.8%
for Ms, 1.5%–7.7% for Mt). Although both models disclosed
similar fitting abilities in some cases (see Fig. 2, upper panel),
the P O2 dynamics introduced a notable performance improvement on other patients (see Fig. 2, lower panel). For example, for
Patient 11, the constant-α formulation implemented in the Ms
model optimization implied the selection of an high radiosensitivity level (α = 0.5), in order to explain the sudden tumor
shrinkage at time t = 40, that could not be compliant with the
initial radioresistant-like behavior, thus leading to an average error level of 16%. Conversely, the Mt model allowed a radiosensitivity variation along the time of treatment in agreement with
the pO2 level, and provided a more compliant interpretation
of the tumor regression exhibited by Patient 11. The predicted
pO2 evolution started from an extremely hypoxic condition and
increased up to over 50% oxygenation with a faster rate after
t = 30. The fitting error comparison (Wilcoxon signed rank test)
showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) between
Ms and Mt predictions.

Mt model fitting errors as a function of the six preselected
T1/2 values (range 0.1–10, see Section III-C) showed a very
large variability ranging from about 1.5% up to almost 30%. For
each patient, the best model was selected as the one providing
the minimum fitting error. The resulting average fitting error,
computed across all patients, was 4.5% (range: 1.5%–7.7%).
The selection of the best performing values of T1/2 allowed
us stratifying patients into two subgroups. The first one (subgroup “fast”) was characterized by a very fast dead-cell removal

(T1/2 < 1), while the second one (subgroup “slow”) exhibited
a longer resolving time (T1/2 ≥ 1). Since a single day is the
shortest period between two acquired volumes, it was selected
as threshold value. A shorter dead-cell reabsorption time is comparable to an instantaneous cell disintegration given the specific
working frame and would allow the model simplification to the
active volume dynamics only.
No evident relationship with the classification according to
type of tumor (SSC, ADC) and treatment (RT, RT + ChT) was
found (cf., Table II). Patients in the “fast” subgroup (T1/2 < 1)
exhibited higher growth rate ρ on average (∼ 0.3 ± 0.11) with
respect to the one found in the “slow” subgroup (∼ 0.16 ± 0.04).
It can be also pointed out, that each one of the “slow” dynamics patients, and none of the others, showed ρ < 0.2. Despite
the fact that Mann–Whitney statistical test comparing the distribution of pO2 (0) (initial oxygenation level) found for the two
patient subgroups, was at the limit of significance (p = 0.08),
pO2 (0) mean values of the two subgroups were notably different 54% and 25%. This is exemplified in Figs. 3 and 4, where
we reported the quality of the tumor volume fitting provided by
the two models, along with the corresponding oxygenation and
radiosensitivity trends for two patients, belonging to the “slow”
(Patient 3, Fig. 3) and the “fast” (Patient 11, Fig. 4) subgroups,
during the treatment.
Patient 3 (see Fig. 3), featuring a slow dead-cell dynamics and an initial oxic condition (pO2 (0) ∼ 70%), was subjected to a small tumor oxygen variation (∼ ±10%). The initial
fast tumor shrinkage corresponded to a pO2 decrease due to
the
 estimated pO2 (0) value being larger than the asymptotic
k −V v 
value (7c). The radiosensitivity parameter α,
V v (t=0) pO2
in agreement with pO2 trend, underwent a limited variation,
ranging between 0.35 and 0.5 Gy−1 . Conversely, for Patient
11 (see Fig. 4), the model assessed a starting severe hypoxic
condition (pO2 (0) ∼ 1%), which evolved into a large tumor
reoxygenation up to pO2 ∼ 85%, with a corresponding slower

stop,2 and again a reoxygenation with a steep increase of the
radioresponsiveness to cope with the corresponding fast tumor
volume shrinkage.
C. Oxygenation Dynamics
No correlation between the estimated pO2 (0) and the initial volume size (V (0)) was found. Both “slow” and “fast”
subgroups featured a very similar V (0) averages (23.3 and
23.4 cm3 , respectively) with no statistical difference (p > 0.9).
Conversely, significant differences (p < 0.004) were found
for pO2 (0) as a function of the type of tumor and treatment (cf., Table I). In particular, patients who underwent radiotherapy only (RT) and those who underwent concomitant
chemo/radiotherapy (RT + ChT) showed very different average
values of pO2 (0): 78% (46 mmHg) for RT and 26% (16 mmHg)
for RT + ChT. This difference in pO2 (0) found confirmation in
the observed tumor regression rates during the first two weeks
(on average) of treatment (see Table II). RT patients showed
the fastest volume shrinkage (∼60%) opposed to a poor 30%
measured for the RT + ChT patients.

D. Linear Sensitivity Analysis
The Mt model robustness to perturbed parameter setting was
investigated by performing a linear sensitivity analysis on the
complete volume dataset available for Patient 5 and Patient 16
(cf., Table I). Similar results were obtained in the two patients
(see Fig. 5), with the most critical parameter being the growth
rate ρ, which produced a fitting error up to 12%, thus twice as
high as the reference fitting error. The less critical parameter
was λ. For Patient 5, a λ perturbation of 25% produced an
almost negligible relative worsening of the fitting performance
(lower than 1%). Conversely, the same perturbation induced a
relative worsening of fitting quality of about 2% (from 5.8% to
7.8% error) for Patient 16. The sensitivity to the viable volume
capacity k turned out to be less critical for Patient 5 (max error
increase <2%) than for Patient 16 (max error increase ∼3%) as
well. The perturbation of the pO2 (0) also turned out to increase
the model fitting errors, up to 7.2% and 8.3% for Patient 5 and
Patient 16, respectively.
E. Model Generalization

dead-cell removal. The almost constant tumor volume size up to
about day 40 was successfully reproduced by the model, which
adapted the dynamics of dead cells with a resolving time (T1/2 )
of five days. In agreement with the dynamics of the viable cells,
the model predicted an initial increasing radiosensitization, followed by a plateau-like trend in correspondence of a treatment

As expected, when the model parameters were estimated on
the dataset of a single patient (Patient 5, “fast” dead-cell dynamics), the predictions for the remaining patients were affected
by large errors (see Fig. 6). On an average, this model performed better (e ∼ 22%) for patients exhibiting a “fast” dynamics (T1/2 < 1) than for those with “slow” dynamics (T1/2 > 1)
(e ∼ 31%). This last result was strongly biased by the large error
measured on patient 11 (e ∼ 30%) featuring a very uncommon
volume regression trend (cf., Fig. 4), with initial high radioresistance. However, even for some patients (Patients 8 and 14)
exhibiting T1/2 values similar to Patient 5, the prediction quality
was very poor (e ≥ 30%). Despite their comparable resolving

V. DISCUSSION
A. Major Findings

Fig. 5. Results of the linear sensitivity analysis for model Mt applied to data
coming from Patients 5 (upper panel) and Patient 16 (lower panel). Discrete
perturbations up to ±25% were applied on ρ, k, P O 2 (0) and λ. Notice the
positive perturbation range for viable volume capacity k.

time value, Patients 8 and Patient 14 reported a ρ value twice
as high as the one of Patient 5, suggesting that T1/2 is not an
accurate predictor for ρ (cf., Table II). It is also obvious that even
small differences in the ρ values can lead to very different tumor
evolutions, thus limiting the generalization of models trained on
different volume datasets.
The model trained on patient 16 (“slow” dynamics), using the
complete dataset, resulted in a slightly larger error for patients
belonging to the “fast” subgroup (e ∼ 22%) with respect to the
“slow” one (e ∼ 18%). As expected, this last error was lower
than that one (e ∼ 31%) computed by using the patient-specific
model based on patient 5 volume data. Some volume regression
profiles (Patients 6, 9, and 15 in the “slow” dynamics subgroup)
were interestingly more successfully predicted (13%, 9%, and

The peculiarity of this study is represented by the attempt to
link tumor growth parameter estimation and model prediction
to clinical data coming from image guided radiotherapy. A subset of the almost daily acquired CBCT was countered (usually
one/two per week) allowing model learning on individual basis.
The reported results provided evidence that the ODE model
is able to fit very different tumor volume evolutions with an
average error lower than 5%. Among all model parameters, the
dead-cell resolving time T1/2 turned out to be a discriminating parameter between two different patterns of tumor response
to irradiation. Patients featuring larger T1/2 values exhibited
a partial volume reduction (<30%) after about two weeks of
treatment, a slower regrowth, and on average, a more hypoxic
condition at time t = 0. This is consistent with the role of the
microenvironment on tumor evolution and response to treatment [19], [3]. Conversely, a lower T1/2 was associated with
higher tumor shrinkage rate at the beginning of the treatment
(∼50%), to remarkable tumor aggressiveness and to an initial
aerobic condition. Unlike previous studies [7], which related
T1/2 to radiosensitivity, our modeling approach relates T1/2
to the oxygenation level pO2 (0), thus with the initial state of
tumor perfusion. Well-perfused tumors may have a short resolving time, but the higher oxygen supply would lead to a higher
therapeutic effects of RT and ultimately to higher local control.
Conversely, limited perfusion due to disrupted vascularization
within the tumor, along with the hypoxia effect, would cause
a delay in the removal process and reduced therapeutic effects
of irradiation. According to the estimated model parameters,
the pO2 (0) value corresponding to the fast dead-cell removal,
was twice as high as the corresponding one associated with
slow dead-cell dynamics. On the other hand, we found that
T1/2 may not have a strong role as a predictor of other model
parameters, but may be regarded as a two-class identifier (see
Section IV-B and Table II). Moreover, a model trained on one
specific patient dataset showed poor prediction ability for other
patients but it achieved better performances on the ones belonging to the same class (“slow”/“fast”). We found that the
estimated value of pO2 (0) did not correlate with the initial tumor volume. As a matter of fact, many earlier studies argued that
the relationship between the two parameters is unclear, possibly because of the heterogeneity of mechanisms underlying the
oxygenation process [18], [27]. We based our modeling on the
assumption that it is not the tumor size but the initial aerobic
condition, the dominating factor, which modulates the speed of
tumor response to irradiation. [28]. Increasing, decreasing, and
almost steady oxygenation levels were found and successfully
fitted. This finding is in agreement with many in vitro and in vivo
studies, where such variability was motivated by either a change
in the tumor cell intrinsic radioresponsiveness, because of
reoxygenation, or by a proportion disparity among different
cell lines featuring heterogeneous radiosensitivity [17], [26],

BELFATTO et al.: MODELING THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN TUMOR VOLUME REGRESSION AND OXYGENATION IN UTERINE CERVICAL

[29]–[31]. The inclusion of oxygen dynamics in the model allowed good quality fitting even in case of late tumor response
to the therapy. For example, in Patient 11, the model predicted
initial low oxygenation level along with a very slow increase of
radioresponsiveness along the first weeks of treatment, corresponding to an almost constant tumor volume size. Later on, the
level of oxygenation, and consequently, the radiosensitivity, underwent a relevant raise explaining the observed sudden tumor
shrinkage (cf., Fig. 4).
In the literature, the reoxygenation rate was reported to vary
widely, ranging from a few hours to several days [6]. Fast reoxygenation may be caused by either recirculation of blood
through vessels that were temporarily closed or by a decreased
cellular respiration (which increases the oxygen diffusion distance). According to this interpretation, consistent oxygenation
increase was observed in correspondence of fast tumor regression rates (cf., Fig. 5). Conversely, slower reoxygenation can be
explained as the result of cell death, leading to tumor shrinkage
and a reduction in intercapillary distances, thus allowing oxygen to reach hypoxic cells [16], [29]. In this second case, the
assumption of a very slow or even constant dynamics of pO2
seems reasonable. For example, in Patient 14, Mt and Ms formulations led to similar fitting results due to a negligible role of
reoxygenation estimated for this patient.
Finally, the upper bound of the oxygenation level, in case of
an extreme aerobic condition at t = 0 (e.g., Patient 2), forced the
model to predict a pO2 decrease. This may be seen as an implicit
modeling of the vessel damages induced by irradiation, since in
an already well-perfused tumor the oxygen redistribution due to
cell death may not be as relevant as in hypoxic tumors.
B. Model Issues
We are aware that there are various issues that may have affected the results and reduced the extent of the findings. The
most relevant are: 1) unmodeled chemotherapy effects; 2) uncertainty on tumor volume measurements obtained from CBCT;
3) nominal against effective dose delivered to the tumor; 4) lack
of pO2 validation data; and 5) limited patient cohort.
As far as chemotherapy is concerned, we did not include
its effect in the model, as it was intended to be an adjuvant to
decrease tumor radioresistance, as traditionally accepted in clinical practice [32]–[34]. However, we acknowledge the several
studies, which explicitly modeled the effects of chemotherapy.
In [35], a Gompertz-type diffusion process, taking into account
different chemotherapy modeling functions, was applied to simulate the net effect of Cisplatin (platinum-based anticancer drug)
and other drugs in the breast cancer treatment of mice models.
A delayed Gompertz tumor growth along with a chemotherapy
killing component was proposed to cope with delayed effects of
repopulation [36]. More complex differential equations (Lotka–
Volterra) were also considered for modeling mutations from
normal to malignant cells including delays and dynamic interaction of chemotherapy [37]. In all these studies, model stability
was also found to be a relevant issue and a reliable parameter
setting on human patients would require invasive and expensive
procedures.

603

The uncertainty on tumor volume data was not quantified
and may greatly affect model parameters estimation, particularly when the overall number of patient is rather small. We
acknowledge that CBCT is a suboptimal imaging modality, featuring high intra- and interoperator variability in tumor delineation. Although we did not perform an extensive assessment of
intraoperator variability, a 10% uncertainty was found among
three blind tumor segmentations performed by an oncologist
on Patient 1 data. This value is put forward to represent the
level of uncertainty, with which model predictions should be
interpreted.
The small T1/2 values, obtained by means of the initial sensitivity analysis, are in agreement with the fast tumor shrinkage
shown by the data at our disposal (about 40% in two weeks).
However, this result is in contrast with recent findings about
the dead cell-clearance time that imply much larger T1/2 values (28–72 days) [38]. Further investigation on a larger dataset,
along with an independent validation of the active and necrotic
volume dynamics, will be required in order to address such
inconsistency.
We used the nominal value of the dose delivered to the target,
although we are aware of the dosimetric uncertainties deriving
from patient setup error and tumor shape and position variations
along the course of the treatment. The effects on dose distribution of inter-fractional geometric uncertainties is a well-known
issue in radiotherapy clinical practice. In the absence of more
advanced in-room imaging techniques (such as MR imaging),
we relied on the CTV–PTV approach followed in the treatment
planning phase and on the image-based CBCT-CT registration
for patient setup correction, which was applied during treatment
delivery for the considered patients.
The lack of the functional data necessary to assess the real
vascularization/oxygenation level along the treatment course,
prevented a proper validation of the pO2 dynamics, which was
based on the overall volume evolution (Vd + Vv ) only. Specific
functional imaging techniques (PET, ultrasound) would be necessary to provide reference values for the validation of the model
predicted oxygenation evolution and the reliability of the model
assumptions, and even exploited as an external input to compute
corresponding level of radiosensitivity.
Finally, we remark that a patient classification according
to tumor type and treatment delivered would not have been
sufficient to identify homogeneous subgroups. The restricted
data cohort prevented an adequate tumor stratification into different clusters based, for example, on the initial oxygenation
condition, and consequently, hindered to assess optimal settings of group-specific parameters. If possible, this stratification would have allowed a systematic model testing on patients
data not included in model training, in order to test model prediction capability. Furthermore, we put forward the idea that
patient-specific customization could be addressed by means
of a continuous parameter tuning along the therapy course,
aiming at minimal mismatch between the predicted and measured tumor volumes. The described model could in principle represent an objective base for treatment replanning, in order to maximize tumor control and reducing healthy tissues
toxicity.

C. Oximetry in Uterine Cervical Cancer
Hypoxic cells have been recognized to affect significantly
tumor growth and treatment response [18], [27], [30]. In both
experimental and clinical studies, the percentage of a tumor
with pO2 less than a threshold value (typically pO2 < 5 −
10 mmHg), called hypoxic fraction (HF), is commonly utilized
as an endpoint. For instance, HF5 indicates the percentage of
tumor cells below the 5 mmHg oxygenation threshold.
The clinical measure of hypoxic cell fraction is based on the
Eppendorf electrode, which requires a needle sensor inserted
into representative areas of the tumor [39]–[41]. Despite its reliability, this approach disregards tumor heterogeneity providing
only an average value, and its invasiveness prevent repeat investigations over time. Other techniques based on PET have
been recently investigated to obtain high-quality images of tumor hypoxia in uterine cervical cancer using novel hypoxiatargeting radiopharmaceutical as (64)Cu-ATSM [42]. However,
such radiotracers are still lacking wider acceptance for routine
clinical application mainly because of slow accumulation in
hypoxic tumors and large uptake variability. In contrast, MRIbased techniques, exploiting BOLD (blood oxygenation level
dependent) [43] and MOXI (MRI-based oxygen imaging) [44]
strategies, appear promising to get noninvasively information
about changes in vascular oxygenation of the tumor.
In the proposed model, the pO2 was considered an average
oxygenation level of the overall tumor independent of the volume size with no distinction between oxic and HFs and no
spatial relation. Information about the initial HF can actually
provide quantitative information to assess pO2 as the sum of
the oxic and the HFs, weighted by the corresponding oxygenation levels, respectively. For example, measuring a tumor HF of
35% ([pO2 ]HF = 5 mmHg) and assuming that the rest of the tumor is completely oxic ([pO2 ]OF = 60 mmHg), the overall pO2
would, thus, be about 45 mmHg. Conversely, if the contribute of
the HF can be disregarded ([pO2 ]HF = 0), the pO2 would equal
exactly the oxic fraction. Further studies are, however, required
to investigate in more details such a relationship. Every operative choice is interdependent, e.g., selecting HF5 over HF10
plays a critical role on the assignment of the average pO2 value
for the hypoxic and oxic fraction, respectively. For example,
using HF5, it could be more reasonable to assume [pO2 ]HF =
0 mmHg along with [pO2 ]OF = 60 mmHg. On the other hand,
in case of HF10, the 0 < [pO2 ]HF = 10 mmHg and [pO2 ]OF =
60 mmHg setting, would probably provide a better pO2 estimation.
VI. CONCLUSION
Despite extensive theoretical works, the application of the
tumor growth modeling in radiotherapy treatment planning still
appears far from being applied to daily clinical practice. This
is largely due to the difficulty in gathering specific patient data
and link them to model parameters. In this perspective, the
main contributions of this study can be summarized as follows:
1) simple proliferative and LQ radiosensitivity models can fit
cervix cancer tumor regression, accounting for experimental uncertainty; 2) tumor regrowth and radiobiological parameters can

be evaluated on a patient-specific basis using volume regression
data from serial CBCT imaging; 3) estimated pO2 -dependent
radiosensitivity correlates favorably with the tumor volume regression; and 4) the introduction of pO2 provides a fitting quality improvement when compared to models featuring constant
radiosensitivity.
In a likely appealing scenario, disclosed by the use of such
model, meaningful information is made available to the physician at the time of treatment planning and during therapy administration so that the therapeutic schedule can be adapted
along the course of the treatment accounting for patient specific
tumor regression patterns observed on image data. Future developments of this study include an independent validation of
the pO2 dynamics using functional data and an extensive evaluation of the role of the CBCT uncertainty with respect to model
performance.
