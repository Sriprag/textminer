Abstract—Goal: In this study, we defined a realistic cerebellar
model through the use of artificial spiking neural networks, testing
it in computational simulations that reproduce associative motor
tasks in multiple sessions of acquisition and extinction. Methods:
By evolutionary algorithms, we tuned the cerebellar microcircuit
to find out the near-optimal plasticity mechanism parameters that
better reproduced human-like behavior in eye blink classical conditioning, one of the most extensively studied paradigms related to the
cerebellum. We used two models: one with only the cortical plasticity and another including two additional plasticity sites at nuclear
level. Results: First, both spiking cerebellar models were able to well
reproduce the real human behaviors, in terms of both “timing” and
“amplitude”, expressing rapid acquisition, stable late acquisition,
rapid extinction, and faster reacquisition of an associative motor
task. Even though the model with only the cortical plasticity site
showed good learning capabilities, the model with distributed plasticity produced faster and more stable acquisition of conditioned
responses in the reacquisition phase. This behavior is explained
by the effect of the nuclear plasticities, which have slow dynamics and can express memory consolidation and saving. Conclusions:
We showed how the spiking dynamics of multiple interactive neural
mechanisms implicitly drive multiple essential components of complex learning processes. Significance: This study presents a very
advanced computational model, developed together by biomedical
engineers, computer scientists, and neuroscientists. Since its realistic features, the proposed model can provide confirmations and
suggestions about neurophysiological and pathological hypotheses
and can be used in challenging clinical applications.

I. INTRODUCTION
HE cerebellum is a fundamental processing unit for a large
number of cognitive and motor tasks [1]. One of the most
studied paradigms of cerebellum involvement is the eye blink
classical conditioning (EBCC) [2]. In the standard EBCC, a
neutral conditioned stimulus (CS), e.g., a tone, precedes an attentive unconditioned stimulus (US), e.g., an air-puff directed
to the eye. The time interval between the onset of the CS and
the onset of US, i.e., the interstimulus interval (ISI), is kept constant during the session trials [3]. At the beginning, the (animal
or human) subjects show eyelid closures (blink) elicited by the
US. After repeated presentations of CS and US paired during
the acquisition phase, the subject learns to blink before the US
arrival; this action is called conditioned response (CR). During
the extinction phase, the subject continues to receive the CS
only, but without the presentation of US. At the beginning, the
learned association still leads to generate CRs. However, the
unneeded anticipated blink response is rapidly extinguished.
Several studies proved the importance of the cerebellum for
the acquisition and extinction of CRs in EBCC sessions. The
signal pathways involved during the EBCC have been established in the literature [see Fig. 1(a)]. The CS is conveyed from
the Pontine Nuclei to the Granular Cells (GRs) through the
Mossy Fibers (MFs) [4]. On the other hand, the US is conveyed
from the Inferior Olive Cells (IOs) to the Purkinje Cells (PCs)
through the Climbing Fibers (CFs) [5]. The PCs also receive
excitatory synapses from GRs through the parallel fibers (PFs).
Finally, the eyelid closure is commanded by the deep cerebellar
nuclei (DCNs), which excite the related motor neurons.
The learning capabilities of the cerebellum are related to the
plasticity mechanisms that change the synaptic weights of the
connections between different groups of cells [6]–[8]. There
are two well-known long-term plasticities for the PF-PC connections: long term potentiation (LTP) and long term depression
(LTD). They are assumed to be responsible for the CR acquisition and extinction [9]. In the last years, other plasticity sites
have been hypothesized [10]–[14], both at cortical and nuclear
levels [15]–[17], in order to take into account the different time
scales which can be identified in cerebellar adaptation. More
specifically, the cerebellar learning can be separated into two
components: a fast process related to the cortical plasticity and
a slow process associated to the nuclear plasticity.
The simplicity of the EBCC and the timing nature of the
protocol have led to the use of this paradigm as a test bench
for computational models of the cerebellum, which range from

mechanisms at MF-DCN and PC-DCN synapses. We embedded
the models in closed-loop computational simulations reproducing the EBCC protocol with two sessions, each comprised of an
acquisition and an extinction phases.
Whereas the inclusion of realistic plasticity equations, spiking
neural dynamics, and recurrent topologies enhanced the descriptive power of SNNs, it also increased the number of free parameters, hence requiring an efficient and automated tuning [24]. In
particular, we exploited metaheuristic techniques (evolutionary
algorithms) to obtain the cerebellar–model plasticity parameters
that better reproduced the physiological behaviors observed in
humans. Even if a complete theoretical basis is not available yet,
metaheuristic methods for optimization are widely used to find
solutions to problems where the search space is complex [25].
Our aim is to highlight the behavioral outcomes produced by
the cerebellar multiple dynamics and, by comparing the SNN
model equipped with only the cortical plasticity and the model
with three plasticity sites, to confer specific roles on the plasticity
mechanisms.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Cerebellar Model

Fig. 1. (a) SNN topology, with connections between the specific cell populations, and the input and output signals for EBCC simulations. The model was
equipped with three plasticity sites, each bidirectional (LTP and LTD), indicated by the transparent areas: PF–PC (pink), MF-DCN (blue), and PC-DCN
(green). For the 1–plasticity model, only the first plasticity was active. For the
3–plasticity model, also the second and third plasticities were enabled. The
inhibitory connection from DCN to IO is dashed because it was implemented
as an external inhibitory mechanism. (b) EBCC protocol scheme. During the
acquisition trials, pairs of CS and US were presented as spike patterns to the
cerebellar microcircuit, at a predefined ISI. The SNN learned to generate CR.
During extinction trials, the only input to the SNN was the CS.

simplified analog versions [18]–[20] to more realistic models
using artificial spiking neural networks (SNN) [21], [22]. The
majority of the published models has only taken into account
the cortical plasticity. A recent example is the large–scale SNN
(more than 100 thousands of neurons) developed by Yamazaki
and Igarashi used during a robotic Pavlovian task to reproduce
the learning mechanisms by PF-PC plasticity [22]. Additionally,
Casellato et al. have embedded and tested a SNN-based cerebellar model during different tasks, such as EBCC and vestibuloocular reflex, both in computational simulations and in real-robotic
platforms [23]. This model has shown its effectiveness obtaining
behaviors similar to neurophysiological experiments, exploiting
only LTP and LTD plasticities at the PF-PC connections.
This study aims at improving the latter SNN model, testing two additional plasticities at the nuclear level: LTP and LTD

We started from a well-tested cerebellar model, exploiting
the event-driven simulator based on look-up-tables [26], an
open-source simulator of SNN (available online at http://code.
google.com/p/edlut/) that speeds up the simulation through the
use of look-up tables; thus, reducing the computational load. All
the experiments were performed on a desktop PC (Intel Core
i7-2600 CPU at 3.40 GHz).
The SNN (see Fig. 1(a)] was composed of 6480 leaky
integrateand-fire neurons that replicated the cerebellar topology: 300 MFs, which were excited by the CS; 6000 GRs; 72
IOs, which received the US; 72 PCs; 36 DCNs, which produced
the cerebellar output and, therefore, the CRs.
The MFs were randomly connected with the GRs, and each
GR received four random connections, for a total of 24 000
excitatory synapses. The granular layer was a sparse representation of the state of the system encoded by the MFs, with each
time sample (1 ms) corresponding to a nonrecurrent state of
this layer. The largest number of synapses involved the PFs,
since they randomly linked each PC with the 80 of the GRs,
for a total of 345444 connections. The 72 CFs constituted one–
to–one teaching connections between IOs and PCs. Each DCN
received excitatory synapses from all the 300 MFs (10 800
synapses in total) and inhibitory connections from two PCs (72
synapses in total). Since the harmfulness of the US diminishes
when the eyelid closure protects the cornea, we implemented a
DCN-IO inhibitory loop. This mechanism halved the incoming
US-related IOs firing rate when a CR was generated just before
the US onset. The nucleoolivary inhibitory loop translated the
motor command signal into a sensory modulation; thus, a single cerebellar area simultaneously tackled both motor execution
and sensory prediction [27].
1) Learning Rules: The 3–plasticity and 1–plasticity SNN
computational models were tested, to compare the learning
properties of cerebellum models that go beyond the classic

PF-PC adaptive mechanism. The 3-plasticity model embedded
three plasticity sites (PF-PC, MF–DCN, and PC–DCN), whereas
the 1–plasticity model embedded only the cortical plasticity
(PF-PC).
The synaptic weights of each plasticity site evolved following
three different learning rules.

t0 was set to 100 ms, matching the physiological delay of the
neural circuit dictated by biology [28]. τ and A are constant factors to normalize the kernel. More detailed explanations about
the rationale of the kernel function can be found in [26].

window set to 20 ms) by the spike of the corresponding DCN,
the inhibitory synapses from the two PCs to that DCN were
increased. This strengthening (maximum LTP change defined
by LTP3 constant) depended on the delay between PC and DCN
spikes. Otherwise, if the opposite chronological order occurred
(within an LTD-time window set to 60 ms), the synapses underwent LTD (maximum LTD change defined by LTD3 constant).
The six LTP and LTD constants (LTP1 , LTD1 , LTP2 , LTD2 ,
LTP3 , and LTD3 ) for the three learning rules were defined
using a metaheuristic parameter optimization as explained in
Section II-C.
B. Protocol
We used the “delayed EBCC” protocol [CS and US coterminate, see Fig. 1(b)] in order to test the models’ capability to
acquire and extinguish CRs. The protocol was divided in two
sessions of 100 trials (session1 and session2 ); each session was
composed of an acquisition phase, with the presentation of CSUS pairs during 80 trials (acquisition1 and acquisition2 ), and an
extinction phase, with the presentation of only CS for 20 trials
(extinction1 and extinction2 ). We set the ISI equal to 400 ms,
which is a standard value used in EBCC studies [3], [29], [30].
The CS lasted 500 ms, equal to the ISI plus the duration of US
(100 ms). Between two consecutive trials, we inserted a pause
of 100 ms, during which the network was silent.
We also tested the robustness of the models when increasing
and decreasing the ISI (350 and 450 ms).
During the CS, the firing rate of MFs varied within a random
uniform distribution between 40 and 50 Hz. During the US, IOs
fired with a mean firing rate of 1 Hz and maximum firing rate
of 10 Hz [31]. The DCNs spiking activity was decoded into the
“cerebellar output” variable using a firing rate approach [21]. A
CR was identified when the cerebellar output variable overcame
a predefined threshold equal to 50. When a CR was identified,
the IOs activity during the following US was reduced by 50%,
due to the DCN-IO inhibitory loop.

The tuning consisted on the regulation of 9 variables: the LTP
and LTD constants and the initialization weights of the plastic
synapses, for the three learning rules (LTP1 , LTD1 , w0 1 LTP2 ,
LTD2 , w0 2 , LTP3 , LTD3 , and w0 3 ). Whereas previous works
used a trial–and–error approach [32], [33], in this study, we
adopted a genetic algorithm (GA) to tune the 3–plasticity model
parameters. The GA was written in MATLAB language, which
automatically triggered each simulation, carrying out EBCC
sessions driven by the model equipped with the updated genes.
Each generation was composed of 12 individuals, each identified by the nine genes. For each individual, a complete EBCC
simulation was carried out. The range of each gene was established using admissible values found in the literature; for the
LTP and LTD constants, we referred to works based on similar
architectures [20], [21], [23], [32], [34] and neurophysiological
restrictions (e.g., LTP1 lower than LTD1 and LTP-LTD2,3 constants lower than LTP-LTD1 ). The three initial weights (genes
3, 6, and 9) could vary between the 10% and the 90% of the
whole range in which the weights of those plastic connections

could move during the learning protocols. This way, both LTP
and LTD could occur with respect to the initial “naı̈ve” network
state. The possible values assumed by the plastic weights during
the simulation were set to enclose the firing rate of the different groups of cells within neurophysiological values [35]. The
upper and lower bounds for each gene are reported in Table I.
The key element of a correct tuning using a GA is the fitness
function, which allows the evaluation of the suitability of each
individual, according to the specific aims. In our case, the fitness function was designed to obtain a physiological outcome,
i.e., the percentage of CRs across the trials, during the four
phases of the protocol (acquisition1 , extinction1 , acquisition2 ,
and extinction2 ). We considered two components: the capability
to reach a certain CR% during the acquisition phases, and the
capability to rapidly extinguish the previously acquired behavior. We designed the fitness function (7), ranging from zero to
one, to be maximized in order to obtain a behavioral outcome

overall as a penalty if the CRs number was “unphysiologically”

The optimal CR% had to reach a value of 70% and remain

This term linearly decreased the fitness value if the number of
“saturated” trials was greater than 20.
The algorithm to define the 12 individuals of the following
generation took into account selection, crossover, and mutation.
The four individuals with the best fitness of their generation
were kept as they were, whereas the other eight individuals
were generated by means of the following steps. The roulette
wheel process selected the potential parents of the following
generation, applying a probability proportional to their fitness
[36]. Then, among these eight individuals, there was an 80% of
probability to perform a crossover between two parents: the uniform crossover swapped four randomly selected genes between
the two parents. After the crossover process, each individual
had a probability of 90% to go through a mutation: a uniform
random reextraction from the gene range of definition (see Table I) for individuals 5–8 or a Gaussian mutation starting from
genes’ current values. After these steps, the final 12 individuals
of the following generation were defined and the new 12 EBCC
simulations started. If the increasing of the maximum fitness
value between two successive generations was lower than 0.1%
for 100 consecutive generations, the GA terminated and the
near–optimal model parameters were found out.
D. Data Analysis
For the whole analysis, we tested the data normality with the
Anderson–Darling test, in order to choose the proper statistical tests. Nonnormally distributed variables were indicated as
“median [25th percentile 75th percentile].”
The results of the GA optimization were evaluated considering all the individuals with the optimal fitness values (i.e.,
fitness equal to one). When more than one individual matched
this criterion, the robustness of the results was preserved

maximum value is plotted as a solid line.

by considering multiple good solutions that guaranteed the
characteristics of the CR acquisition and extinction; thus, we
obtained a population of near-optimal 3–plasticity models.
As expected, due to the elitism of the GA, the maximum fitness values monotonically increased along the generations (see
Fig. 2). The GA stopped after 133 generations, testing 1596
combinations (individuals) of the nine genes. Among them, 109
individuals had fitness values equal to one and they constituted
the 3–plasticity model population. The same 109 individuals
were modified, blocking the MF-DCN and PC–DCN plasticity
sites (i.e., setting to zero genes 4–5 and 7–8, i.e. LTP2 , LTD2 ,
LTP3 , and LTD3 ). They constituted the 1–plasticity model population that was compared to the 3–plasticity one.
For each of the two model populations, we measured the
percentage of CRs along the whole simulation, with a moving
window of ten trials, and the latency of CRs, defined as the time
difference between the CR and US onsets. For both populations,
we computed:
1) The median and interquartile ranges of the trial number
when the threshold of 70% was reached by the CR%;
2) the median and interquartile ranges of the CR% in both
acquisition1 and acquisition2 ;
3) the median and interquartile ranges of the latency in both
acquisition1 and acquisition2 .
Statistical tests have been carried out in order to verify
whether and in which learning phases significant differences
in CRs rate come out between the two model populations.
In particular, CRs were grouped in blocks of ten trials each
and each block was compared between 1–plasticity and 3–
plasticity models and between session1 and session2 . We used
the Kruskal–Wallis test to measure if there were statistical differences between CRs rates generated in the four conditions (1–
plasticity session1, 3–plasticity session1, 1–plasticity session2 ,
and 3–plasticity session2 ). Then, we applied a post hoc test to
highlight pairwise comparisons. For all the statistical tests, the
significance level p was set to 0.05.
A deeper analysis, explaining how the SNN learned to express
CRs in a proper way, was carried out considering the median
individual among the 3-plasticity models and the corresponding

which the weights of those plastic connections could move during the learning
protocols.

differences between the 3-plasticity and 1-plasticity models,

account of the weights changes driven by the multiple, or single,

the neurophysiological values [35].
Finally, we used the parameters set of the two models’ populations to carry out EBCC protocols with shorter and longer
ISIs, computing the behavioral outcome of both the 3–plasticity
and 1–plasticity model populations. We compared the resulting
learning properties using the same indexes described above.

E. Robustness Tests
In order to verify if the GA results were reproducible and
consistent, we run the optimization process five more times.
Due to its intrinsic random behavior, each GA execution could
identify different near optimal models driving different learning trends. We, thus, compared the behavior obtained from the
optimal models coming from the six GA executions, both in
session1 and session2 .
III. RESULTS
As a first result, the GA was capable to explore the complex
9–D space of the genes, finding combinations that produced simulations reproducing EBCC learning curves similar to human
data, leading the fitness to increase up to its maximum value. For
the first 28 generations, the GA did not find combinations that
led to a fitness greater than zero, and the genes were uniformly
selected within their ranges (see Fig. 3).
Around the 30th generation, individuals with higher fitness
values were identified, and the genes exploration partially focused on values in the surroundings of these individuals (Gaussian mutations) and partially explored the entire search space
(Uniform mutations).
The median individual of the 3-plasticity population had the
following genes: LTP1 = 1.6143 × 10−2 , LTD1 = −9.5764
× 10−1 , w0 1 = 1.6499 , LTP2 = 3.5066 × 10−7 , LTD2 =
−4.1308 × 10−8 , w0 2 = 3.0909 × 10−2 , LTP3 = 1.9650 ×
10−7 , LTD3 = 8.2685 × 10−8 , and w0 3 = 6.2458 × 10−1 .

The 1-plasticity models were generated keeping LTP1 and
LTD1 constants and all the initialization weights unchanged.
The behavioral outcomes of the two populations were almost
identical in acquisition1 , extinction1 , and extinction2 , whereas
they differentiated in acquisition2 (see Fig. 4).
Indeed, the CR% generated by the best 3-plasticity models
increased earlier than the CR% produced by the 1-plasticity
models and they kept higher CR% values with a lower variability
in late stable acquisition (see the red area in Fig. 4 is narrower
than the grey one). The analysis of the first two indexes declared
in Section II is shown in Table II and supported the hypothesis
that the main differences between the two models regarded the
reacquisition phase only. On the other hand, the latency values
did not show significant modifications between the two sessions
and between the two model populations.
The Kruskal–Wallis test, performed for each Block of ten
trials, showed that there were significantly differences in the
outcome of the two model populations and in the two sessions for Blocks 1–4 and Block 6. The post hoc analysis,
summarized in Fig. 5, proved that the 3-plasticity model outcome in session2 was significantly higher than the 1–plasticity
model outcome in session2 for Blocks 1–3, during the early
reacquisition phase. Both the models were significantly faster
with respect to session1 for Blocks 1 and 2. For Blocks 5–10,
no significant differences came out, except for Block 6, where

the outcomes in the second session were slightly lower than in
the first session.
Considering the spikes patterns evolution of PCs and DCNs
(see Fig. 6), there were no significant differences between the
3–plasticity model and the 1–plasticity model in the first 100
trials, whereas the PCs were more active (i.e., higher PF-PC
synaptic weights) in acquisition2 of the 3–plasticity than in
the 1–plasticity model. Contrary to what might be thought, the

DCNs in acquisition2 fired more with the 3-plasticity model,
even though the higher PCs activity inhibited more the corresponding DCNs.
In Table III, there are reported the mean firing rates for PCs
and DCNs between 300 and 400 ms from the CS onset at the 20th
trial of acquisition1 and of acquisition2 (120th trial). The firing
rates at the 20th trial were identical between the two models,
whereas in early acquisition2 , the firing rates of PCs decreased
for the 1–plasticity model only. On the other hand, the DCNs
frequencies were higher for the 3–plasticity model, in spite of a
higher inhibition coming from the PCs. Therefore, the firing rate
values and the spike pattern analysis suggested that the better
performances of the 3-plasticity model depended on the nuclear
plasticity sites and their modulation capabilities.

The studied cerebellar model exhibited realism on various
aspects. The topology respected the anatomical ratios between
the different groups of cells, the spiking nature of the model
produced a neural activity directly comparable to neurophysiological recordings and the mean firing rates of neural population
varied within acceptable ranges. Thus, the overall dynamics of
the network fairly reproduced the biological behavior.
The successful results in terms of behavioral outcomes
demonstrated also the high-level realism of the controller, which
was able to reproduce the same responses showed in humans
or animals in the same learning paradigm. For example, in both
the 3-plasticity and 1-plasticity models, the CR% increase in
acquisition2 was more rapid than in acquisition1 . The same behavior was found in human subjects in multisession EBCC.
Some properties of the simulated behavior reflect directly
some model parameters defined in the circuit architecture, anyway introduced based on neurophysiological knowledge at neural and network level. For example, the delay constant t0 within
the kernel of the cortical plasticity rule was crucial in determining the DCN response latencies with respect to the inhibitory
action from PCs. Moreover, the search spaces for the nine genes
in the GA runs were defined a priori, influencing the timescale
of the different learning rules (LTP and LTD constants) and the
ranges of firing rates of the different cell groups (initialization
weights w0 ), as suggested by low–level neurophysiological theories. The high-level differences in behavioral terms between
the first and the second sessions or between the 1–plasticity
model and the 3–plasticity model emerged from the circuit itself and our computational approach proved to be promising in
directly linking specific neural properties and the human-like
observed behavior.
The key element linking the spiking neural activity and the
resulting motor commands is the synaptic plasticity; integrating
cortical and nuclear plasticity sites at PF-PC, MF–DCN, and PCDCN connections allowed showing up the role of the cerebellum
in learning, adaptation, prediction, and memory on multiple time
scales. We inferred that the action of the nuclear plasticities
did not modify the timing of the CR within the trial length,
since the latency values did not changed. On the other hand, the
distributed plasticity modulated the DCNs activity, increasing
their firing rates and improving the capability of the model to
retain the behavior acquired in acquisition1 , in order to express
CRs earlier in acquisition2 .
These results confirmed the physiological hypotheses on cerebellar functions [37] and were consistent with the outcome of
simulations driven by analog models [19], [20]. In fact, in the
idea of distributed synergistic plasticity, individual forms of
plasticity are not comprehensive alone. The 3–plasticity model
confirmed the hypotheses that nuclear synapses (PC-DCN and
MF-DCN) are plastic on a slow time scale and store persistent
memory, whereas cortical plasticity (PF-PC) could operate on

Fig. 8. GA robustness: Behavioral outcomes with multiple (six) GA optimization processes. As in Fig. 4, outcomes (CR%), along the consecutive 200 trials,
are depicted: In red with the 3-plasticity model, and in black with 1-plasticity
model.

Furthermore, the same protocol, applied to different ISIs with
both the 3-plasticity and the 1-plasticity models (see Fig. 7) confirmed the robustness of the models; they were able to express
learning in a physiological number of acquisition trials and
to rapidly extinguish the previously acquired behavior, even if
some saturation phenomenon emerged.
With different ISIs, the disparities between 3-plasticity and
1–plasticity models were less evident (see Table IV), but it is
still possible to notice that the behavioral outcomes generated
with the model with distributed plasticity demonstrated, taking
into account the acquisition2 phases, slightly faster and more
stable CR%. As with ISI-baseline, the latency values did not
change depending on the sessions’ phases and on the number of
plasticity sites embedded in the model.
Finally, the behavioral outcomes obtained from the execution
of the six GAs were comparable to the one previously analyzed
in details. In all the six GAs, the stopping criterion was reached
in about 150 generations, and individuals with fitness equal to 1
were found in all the cases, proving the robustness and consistency of the proposed tuning approach. The outcome obtained
considering all the best models of all the six GAs (see Fig. 8)

a shorter time scale, storing transient memory that could be
consolidated in the nuclear plasticity sites.
It is important to emphasize that the key player in cerebellar
learning was the cortical plasticity, since also the 1–plasticity
model was able to generate associative responses using only
the PF–PC plasticity. This finding confirms the pillar concept
of the Marr–Albus–Ito motor learning theory, which entails that
learning involves plasticity at the PF–PC synapses under the
supervision of the CFs [6]–[8]. However, the addition of plasticity capabilities at the nuclear sites significantly impacted on
the model performances during the second acquisition phase.
Even if the proposed model showed good performances and
realistic behaviors, it did not include other forms of plasticity,
e.g., in the granular layer [11], [38] or other neurons, e.g., the
molecular layer interneurons (stellate and basket cells) [39].
Regarding the molecular interneurons, they control the simple
spikes firing of the PCs by feedforward inhibition and they
mediate memory consolidation processes, showed in rats during
vestibuloocular reflex tasks. Future refinements of the proposed
model could include this inhibitory loop to PCs, in order to
verify if this additional pathway changes the memory storage
capabilities of the cerebellar microcircuit in both motor and
associative learning.
However, multiple learning rules for the different plasticity sites raised, from the computational point of view, the
complexity of the model, increasing the number of parameters that needs to be tuned. The GA was developed and exploited as an efficient tool to tune automatically the SNN. It
allowed finding the proper parameters of the model, without
wasting time and resources using other techniques; in fact, typical methods like direct search or trial–and–error modulation
would reveal computationally unfeasible when dealing with
such complex systems and high-dimensional parameter space.
Therefore, through the introduction of focused evolutionary operators and proper constraints on the parameters, the network
was efficiently tuned. The final resulting solution was used for
all the following tests; thus, demonstrating the generalizability
of the near–optimal cerebellar microcircuit.
V. CONCLUSION
In this study, we compared two different SNN cerebellar models, and we challenged them to reproduce how human beings
acquire and extinguish CRs during an associative motor task.
The 3-plasticity model, embedded with distributed plasticity, showed different time scales of learning and improved its
performance. We validated the models robustness in learning associative responses with different ISIs, and we have shed light
on acquisition, extinction, and consolidation mechanisms, associable to the different active plasticity sites.
The 3–plasticity model presents very interesting novelties,
such as greater realism that resembles neurophysiological evidences and real-time characteristics, which make the model
ready to be used and tested in neurorobotic applications.
Certainly, there are diverse aspects that could be improved:
by increasing the number of neurons or including more realistic
neuron dynamics, the model will gain in fidelity, computational
power, and output resolution.

With these improvements, the here validated closed–loop
cerebellar circuit can represent a promising clinical tool. Indeed, the SNN with modified parameters to reproduce cerebellar abnormalities, such as specific lesions or cellular disruption,
could predict the expected and correlated behavioral outcomes.
On the other hand, the evolutionary algorithm exploited in this
study could be used to find the model parameters that produce an outcome fitting specific patients’ misbehaviors. Thus,
patient-specific models could suggest which underlying neural modifications affect certain aspects of the patients’ learning
performances.
