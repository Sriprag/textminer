Efficient Heart Sound Segmentation and Extraction
Using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition
and Kurtosis Features

Abstract—An efficient heart sound segmentation (HSS) method
that automatically detects the location of first (S1 ) and second
(S2 ) heart sound and extracts them from heart auscultatory raw
data is presented here. The heart phonocardiogram is analyzed by
employing ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) combined with kurtosis features to locate the presence of S1 , S2 , and
extract them from the recorded data, forming the proposed HSS
scheme, namely HSS-EEMD/K. Its performance is evaluated on
an experimental dataset of 43 heart sound recordings performed
in a real clinical environment, drawn from 11 normal subjects,
16 patients with aortic stenosis, and 16 ones with mitral regurgitation of different degrees of severity, producing 2608 S1 and
S2 sequences without and with murmurs, respectively. Experimental results have shown that, overall, the HSS-EEMD/K approach determines the heart sound locations in a percentage of
94.56% and segments heart cycles correctly for the 83.05% of
the cases. Moreover, results from a noise stress test with additive
Gaussian noise and respiratory noises justify the noise robustness
of the HSS-EEMD/K. When compared with four other efficient
methods that mainly employ wavelet transform, energy, simplicity,
and frequency measures, respectively, using the same experimental
database, the HSS-EEMD/K scheme exhibits increased accuracy
and prediction power over all others at the level of 7–19% and
4–9%, respectively, both in controls and pathological cases. The
promising performance of the HSS-EEMD/K paves the way for
further exploitation of the diagnostic value of heart sounds in everyday clinical practice.

I. INTRODUCTION
EART auscultation, i.e., the act of listening with a stethoscope to sounds produced by the heart, lungs, and blood,
is an essential part of the physical examination and can provide
information about the rate and rhythm, valve functioning, and
anatomical defects of the heart. It has been used as an official diagnostic method since Laennec invented the first stethoscope in

1816 [1]. The most recent development in auscultation is the use
of electronic stethoscopes that convert the acoustic sound waves
to electrical signals, which can then be amplified and processed
for optimal listening. However, heart auscultation and interpretation of its findings still depend on the subjectivity and the
training of the human ear, due to the lack of a fully automated
diagnosis tool; hence, doctors have to perform this task on their
own. The preponderant methods of inspecting the heart condition are the ECG and the ultrasound; they are, though, compared
to auscultation, less cost-effective and with more hardware demands. Thus, auscultation constitutes the most suitable heart
examination method for primary health care, where simplicity
and low cost are particularly appreciated.
The heart functions by repeating cycles of systole and diastole. During systole, the heart chambers eject blood, while
during diastole, the heart chambers are filled with blood. This
periodicity is also found in the heart sounds, where a first sound,
i.e., S1 , is heard at the beginning of systole, while a second
sound, i.e., S2 , is heard at the beginning of diastole. Generally,
the mechanisms responsible for the heart sound productions
cause eddies in the vascular system and produce vibrations that
are audible. S1 and S2 constitute the normal heart sounds and
both result from the closing of the valves at each heart period
(mitral and tricuspid valves before systole, aortic and pulmonic
valves before diastole). Nevertheless, there are other sounds that
might be heard as a result of irregular blood flow and may have
a pathological cause or not. These are S3 , S4 , and a category
of sounds, called murmurs, that is associated with valve dysfunctions. There are many kinds of murmurs, defined by the
following characteristics: location where the murmur is best
heard, loudness (depending on the height of the sound wave),
frequency (depending on the wave cycles generated per second),
quality of sound, timing (systolic or diastolic), and possible radiation to other chest areas. Two of the most frequently met
dysfunctions that cause murmurs are the aortic stenosis and the
mitral regurgitation [2].
The acoustic signal produced by the heart sounds can be visually depicted in the phonocardiogram (PCG). Representative
cases of heart sound signals are depicted in Fig. 1. Digital signal processing techniques can then be applied to the PCG as a
means for analysis, information extraction, and processing. A
first step in the analysis of the PCG is the heart sound segmentation (HSS), which is the division of the heart cycle into its four
components, i.e., diastole-S1 -systole-S2 , or, equivalently, the
identification of the positions of S1 and S2 . Using the ECG as
an auxiliary signal to perform this task may serve as a reference

for the detection of the sounds; however, this study is mainly
interested in the purely phonocardiographic approaches.
Up to now, a number of HSS schemes have been reported
in the literature. Many of them are based on wavelet transform (WT) analysis, that, using a basis function, progressively
decomposes a signal into its low- and high-frequency characteristics, namely the approximation and detail coefficients,
respectively [3]–[8]. In particular, Chebil and Al-Nabulsi suggested the Discrete WT (DWT) decomposition/reconstruction
of the PCG signal to form an HSS-DWT scheme, where the peak
values of S1 are identified using the approximation coefficients,
while the peak values of S2 emerge from the reconstructed detail
approximations [3]. Matching pursuit, a decomposition analysis based on the WT, has been considerably used for the time–
frequency analysis of the PCG, for distinguishing murmurs from
normal heart sounds, for determining the degree of normality of
a sound, and for the independent segmentations of S1 and S2
into their components [9]–[13]. Another widely applied method
involves calculating the Shannon energy of the recorded PCG
signal [14], [15]. In particular, Ari et al. took into account the
energy content of the heart sounds and their time topology and
suggested a robust and simple HSS algorithm (HSS-ET) [15].
In study [8], both WT and energy of the PCG were employed
to detect different heart sounds, while in [16], the events of the
cardiac cycle were detected through the envelopes of amplitude,
energy, and frequency of the PCG. Naseri et al. distinguished the
PCG components based on an expert frequency–energy-based
metric, forming the HSS-FEM scheme [17]. These approaches
lie in the general case of calculating the envelope of the PCG
to detect its peaks. A comparison study of the envelope extraction methods was performed in [18], including the Shannon
energy, the Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT), and the characteristic waveform of the PCG. Analysis of the heart sounds based
on the HHT has been presented in [19] and [20], while a detec-

1139

tion method of the third and the fourth heart sounds based on
the HHT was presented in [21]. Another envelope-based method
for pediatric HSS was described in [22], where the envelope is
obtained through short-time spectral energy and autoregressive
parameters of the signal and the detected sounds are classified
using a Multilayer Perceptron classifier. Furthermore, in [23],
the Viola integral method was used to calculate the characteristic and the characteristic moment waveforms, while the sounds’
cyclical characteristics were considered for the HSS. Nigam and
Priemer have presented a simplicity-based method for PCG segmentation, which uses inherent complexity of the heart sound
components [24]. Then, Vepa et al. proposed an HSS-ETS
scheme using energy, simplicity, and timing information, yielding better results with an accuracy up to 84% [25]. A different
approach was suggested in [26], where homomorphic filtering
and k-Means were used for HSS. Gamero and Watrous, as well
as Gill et al., have proposed a probabilistic approach for detecting S1 and S2 , by employing Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
to model the systole and diastole periods [27], [28]. Durationdependent HMMs were recently introduced to improve the segmentation performance of the HMMs [29], but were not tested
on patients with valve disease. Fuzzy logic was also used in an
arrhythmias detection-oriented HSS method [30]. Finally, Tang
et al. introduced dynamic clustering based on density function
after decomposing the PCG signal into atoms [31].
The majority of the aforementioned methods focuses on the
energy and frequency properties of the signal. However, detection through these techniques requires selection of thresholds and parameters, which are commonly not much motivated
or excessively depending on the available datasets characteristics. Another commonplace impropriety is that heart sounds
features reported in the literature, concerning the S1 and S2
frequency range, or the S1 and S2 durations, are applied too
tightly, resulting in misinterpreting the sounds that are deviating from the expected ranges, especially in valve diseases
cases, where sounds features are frequently altered. It is therefore preferable to decompose the signal into its own fluctuations rather than filter it based on fixed values. This is most
probably the motivation behind the WT HSS schemes; however,
wavelets employ predetermined decomposition scales. An alternative, adaptive, and data-driven decomposition is the intention
of this study, as it is expected to adjust more to the waveforms
characteristics.
This study proposes a novel HSS method that uses ensemble
empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) [32] to analyze heart
sounds into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) along with kurtosis
statistics, to detect the abrupt changes, that the occurrences of
S1 and S2 cause to the derived IMFs. EEMD is a noise-assisted
data analysis that evolved from empirical mode decomposition
(EMD) [33]. According to Wu and Huang, the EEMD enables
the EMD to be a true dyadic filter for any data [32]. The merits of analyzing the heart sounds by IMFs have been presented
in [20] and [34], while Boutana et al. proposed optimal IMFs
for the denoising of the heart sound signals [35]. EMD has been
suggested as a feature extraction method in [36], and has been
used as such in [37], to classify the segmented sounds drawn
from [15] into different pathologies. Recently, EEMD-based

1140

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. 18, NO. 4, JULY 2014

feature extraction was adopted in a system that utilizes recorded
heart sounds and electrocardiogram signals to automatically distinguish between normal and abnormal heart conditions [38].
The aim of this study is to use EEMD to segment the cardiac
cycle before proceeding to the sounds classification, so that the
two steps do not employ more than one signal analysis method.
The increased quality of the segmented and extracted S1 and
S2 provides the physician with an enhanced source of diagnostic information, available at the everyday clinical practice,
and adds to the realization of a full-cycle process, i.e., data acquisition, data segmentation/de-noising, feature extraction, and
classification. In addition, kurtosis has often been used in the
signal processing field due to its ability to detect the changes
of a waveform [39], [40]. The proposed HSS method, namely
HSS-EEMD/K has been applied on a database that includes
heart sounds from normal subjects and sounds from patients
with aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation, with embedded
murmurs that make the S1 and S2 discrimination and extraction
from the PCG data harder. The experimental results have shown
a promising performance, elaborated further by a noise stress
test and the comparison analysis among the performance of
HSS-DWT [3], HSS-ET [15], HSS-FEM [17], HSS-ETS [25],
and HSS-EEMD/K, from which the proposed approach exhibits
increased accuracy and prediction power versus all other four
ones.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II
introduces a mathematical background, whereas Section III describes the proposed approach. Section IV discusses some experimental and implementation issues, while Section V presents
and discusses the experimental, noise stress test, and comparison analysis results obtained. Finally, Section VI concludes the
paper.
II. MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
A. Empirical Mode Decomposition
Contrary to previous methods, EMD does not use an a priori
basis of expansion, as it is entirely data driven. The main idea
behind it is that all data consist of different simple intrinsic
modes of oscillations, represented by the IMFs. An IMF has to
satisfy two conditions: 1) in the whole raw data, the numbers
of extrema and zero-crossings must either be equal or differ
at most by one, and 2) at any point, the mean value of the
envelope defined by the local maxima and the envelope defined
by the local minima is zero [33]. The EMD method analyzes the
signal at its local oscillation scale, subtracts the faster oscillation,
and iterates on the residual. The algorithm for producing the
L-empirical modes (IMFs) from a given signal x(t) is called a
sifting process [33] and allows for the signal to be expressed as:

x(t) =

L


IM F λ (t) + rL (t)

(1)

λ=1

where IM F λ (t) denotes the λth IMF and rL (t) is a final (trendlike) residue.

B. Ensemble EMD
EEMD has been proposed to remedy the problem of mode
mixing, occurring in EMD [32]. In a mode mixing case, different
modes of oscillation may appear in one IMF or one mode can
spread across different IMFs, depriving the IMFs of physical
meaning. In EEMD, an ensemble mean is taken from a number
of IMFs extracted from multiple applications of EMD to the
original data, with the addition of white noise series. The added
noise occupies the entire time–frequency space and the parts
of the signal are automatically projected onto proper scales of
reference established by the white noise, thus, eliminating the
mode mixing effect. The ensemble mean of a number of corresponding IMFs will leave only the IMF signal, as a collection
of white noise cancels each other out in a time-space ensemble
mean [32].
C. Kurtosis
The kurtosis of a fourth-order stationary, zero-mean, stochastic process x(t) is defined as the fourth-order cumulant for
zero-lag [41]. The kurtosis parameter is merely estimated using
a finite-length time-window and its value depends on the length
of the sample. Thus, the kurtosis estimate is authorized to exist
in a confidence interval, which is conditioned by the probability properties of the estimator. Asymptotically, this could give
the exact value of the kurtosis; both real-life applications and
transients are, however, temporally bounded. Hence, one has
to determine both a lower and an upper bound for the estimator. Given a desired confidence interval, the estimator can be
framed between two values, depending on the first statistics of
the estimator. For the X random variable (X ∈ x(t)) of mean μ
and standard deviation σ, the Chebyshev inequality [42] yields
a lower bound of the probability that exists inside an interval
centered at μ and having a diameter 2ε, i.e.,

concluding that if the kurtosis estimate of a N -sample observation x(n) lies outside I(N, q), then it is natural to assume that
x(n) does not follow a Gaussian distribution. It could be hypothesized that in the absence of heart sounds, the PCG signal follows a Gaussian or at least symmetrical distribution, while when
a heart sound occurs it does not. This concept is transferred to
the EEMD domain, twofolds: 1) as a means to select [using (6)]
the IMFs that embed the frequency content of the heart sounds
(frequency-domain characteristic-selection across IMFs) and
2) as a means to extract the segments of the selected IMFs that
deviate from Gaussianity, thus detecting the time-locked heart
sound occurrences (time-domain characteristic-selection within
IMFs). With a simple reconstruction of the selected IMFs and
the corresponding segments, the extraction of the heart sound
from the background PCG signal is feasible. These ideas are the
core rationale behind the proposed HSS-EEMD/K approach.
III. PROPOSED HSS-EEMD/K SCHEME
A. Preprocessing
A schematic representation of the complete proposed HSSEEMD/K scheme is presented in Fig. 2, combined with a working example (see Fig. 3). Median and low-pass filtering is initially applied to the normalized, zero-mean N -sample PCG signal, denoted by x[n] (n = 1, . . . , N ). A third-order median filter
is used to enhance the quality of the acquired signal, followed by
a tenth-order low-pass Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency
of 150 Hz, producing the filtered signal xf [n] (n = 1, . . . , N ).
Reduction of the high-frequency noise and the high-frequency
murmur effect facilitates the detection of S1 and S2 , whose
major energy concentrations lie below 150 Hz [44].
B. EEMD-Based IMFs Estimation and Selection
The filtered PCG signal xf [n] (n = 1, . . . , N ) is then decomposed into L IMF components using EEMD. The IMFs
are denoted by IM F λ [n] (λ = 1, . . . , L), while the residual is
denoted by rL [n] (n = 1, . . . , N ). Since each sequential IMF
contains lower frequency oscillations than the one extracted
before, the frequency heart sound components are distributed
across different IMFs. Fig. 3(i) presents an example of an original PCG signal x[n] [see Fig. 3(i)–(a)], the filtered signal xf [n]
[see Fig. 3(i)–(b)], and the first six IMFs extracted by the EEMD
application on the latter [see Fig. 3(i)–(c):(h)]. Then, a threecriteria test is performed to select the IMFs that contain the
S1 and S2 important components, so that further analysis is
performed only on them.
1) Energy-Based Criterion: This criterion aims to exclude
the IMFs that do not enclose significant energy concentration
related to S1 and S2 . The ratio

 M η

ηλ =
(7)
E (xf [n])2
where 1 ≤ Mη ≤ L, n = 1, . . . , N and E{·} denotes the mean
value operator, evaluates the energy contribution of each IMF
normalized to the total energy of the xf [n]. The ηλ parameter
is iteratively calculated until it exceeds a threshold value, determining the first Mη IMFs that contain the largest part of the

1141

filtered signals energy. Thus, an Ωη set of the selected Mη IMFs
is formed as
Ωη = {IM F η[n]}

(8)

where η = 1, . . . , Mη .
2) Instantaneous Frequency-Based Criterion: The second
criterion eliminates the IMFs whose mean instantaneous frequency, denoted by MIF does not correspond to the S1 , S2
frequency content. As mentioned earlier, the major concentrations of energy of both S1 and S2 lie below 150 Hz. To this end,
the MIF of each IMF is calculated and a threshold is applied to
select the last MF IMFs with an MIF of less than 150 Hz (1 ≤
MF ≤ L). The second selected set of IMFs is denoted by
ΩF = {IM F F [n]}

(9)

where F = L − MF + 1, . . . , L. In this way, the additive highfrequency noise and the high-frequency components of present
murmurs that were not removed by the preprocessing filtering
are eliminated.
3) Bootstrap Kurtosis-Based Criterion: The third criterion
employs the Gaussianity test that was previously analyzed (see
Section II-C). Given a specific probability q, the confidence
interval I(N, q) is calculated using (6). Then, using (3) and the
Bootstrap method [45] for b times, the kurtosis estimate of each
N -sample IMF is computed as
N
IM F 4λ [n]
(10)
γ̂4λ,b = (N − 1)  Nn =1
	2
2
n =1 IM F λ [n]
where λ = 1, . . . , L. The mean γ̂4λ,b for each IMF, denoted by
E{γ̂4λ,b }, is extracted and compared to I(N, q). If E{γ̂4λ,b } lies
outside the confidence interval, then the λth IMF does not follow
the Gaussian distribution and, thus, it is expected to contain the
heart sound occurrence content. The MK (1 ≤ MK ≤ L) IMFs
that satisfy the third criterion comprise the ΩK set, so that
ΩK = {IM F K [n]}

(11)

where 1 ≤ K ≤ L. The final selected set of M IMFs, denoted
by sIM F is the one that fulfills all three criteria; hence,
sIM F m [n] = Ωη ∩ ΩF ∩ ΩK

(12)

where m = 1, . . . , M , 1 ≤ M ≤ min(Mη , MF , MK ), and n =
1, . . . , N . The selection procedure for the IMFs of Fig. 3(i) is
shown in Fig. 3(ii).
C. Kurtosis-Based S1 and S2 Detection
The primary heart sounds of the PCG signal are located using
an algorithm based on the calculation of the kurtosis estimate
across the selected IMFs. This algorithm consists of the following steps:
1) Kurtosis Estimate Calculation: W sliding windows of
lengths lw (w = 1, . . . , W ) are applied on the N -sample sIM F
set and the kurtosis estimate is calculated using (4), as
l w

where m is the number of the sIM F (m = 1, . . . , M ), lw is the
wth sliding window (w = 1, . . . , W ), and k is the last sample of
each sliding window, on which the calculated kurtosis estimate
value is assigned to (k = lw , . . . , N ). The window slides with
one-sample shift until the last sample of the window coincides
with the last sample of the heart sound segment. In this step, a
total of M × W kurtosis estimate vectors are produced.
2) γ̂4m,l w [k] Selection: Since the kurtosis estimate value depends on the window length within it is calculated, it is not certain that all γ̂4m,l w [k] vectors will correspond to non-Gaussian
kurtosis estimate values. Therefore, another Gaussianity test
is performed at this point in order to use only the ones that
comply with (5). Specifically, using the same q as in the IMF

selection and (6), the confidence intervals I(lw , q) are calculated
for each window. Then, each γ̂4m,l w [k] vector is selected only if
its maximum absolute value lies outside I(lw , q). Assuming that
m,l w
T γ̂4m,l w [k] vectors are selected, they are denoted by γ̂4,j
[k],
where j = 1, . . . , T and T ≤ M × W .
3) Heart Sound Starts and Ends Determination: Kurtosis
ability to detect the changes along a signal is used to determine
the starts and ends of the heart sounds. When a change occurs,
m,l w
[k] value tends to
e.g., when a sound starts or ends, the γ̂4,j
become bigger. A more abrupt change results in a bigger kurtosis
m,l w
[k] are
estimate value. To locate the sounds starts, all the γ̂4,j
multiplied. Since their value is bigger on the locations where a
sound starts, the value of the product on the specific locations
will be boosted. The hearts sound starts are thus defined as
the locations where the derivative of the product obtains its
maximum value. This is expressed as
⎡
⎤

m,l w
γ̂4,j
[k]⎦ (14)
HSstart (s) = Locations of max ⎣diff
j =1

where s = 1, . . . , S and S is the number of the sounds starts
found. One would expect that (14) would detect also the locations where the sounds end. However, the ends of the sounds,
being close to the starts, appear shifted to the right. In particular,
the shifting is proportional to the window length. To this end,
m,l w
m,l w
[k] undergoes a lw left shift forming the γ̂4,j
[k + lw ]
each γ̂4,j

vectors. Then, the product of these γ̂4,j [k + lw ] is calculated
and the ends of the sounds are defined as the locations where its
derivative obtains its maximum value:
⎡
⎤

m,l w
HSend (s) = Locations of max ⎣diff

(15)
In (15), HSend (s) has to have the same length as HSstart (s).
Therefore, a check is performed to ensure that the heart sounds
ends correspond to the heart sounds starts. According to the
literature, a heart sound duration lies between 0.055 and 0.15 s
[46]. For s = 1, . . . , S, HSend (s) is expected to be found within
the area t = HSstart (s) + (0.055 ×Fs ):HSstart (s) + (0.15 ×Fs ),
where Fs denotes the sampling

is found and assigned to HSend (s). The chosen sound starts and

one sorted vector, denoted by klo c (i), i = 1, . . . , 2S according
to the following equations:

peaks in the locations of the sounds are boosted after the mulm,l w

4) Discrimination between S1 and S2 : The decision between S1 and S2 is based on the fact that in a cardiac cycle, the
diastolic duration is longer than the systolic one. For i = 1, . . . ,
S − 2, the following inequality is successively checked
j =1

klo c (2i + 1) − klo c (2i) < klo c (2i + 3) − klo c (2i + 2). (17)
If (17) is true, the area klo c (2i + 1):klo c (2i + 2) corresponds
to an S2 , else it corresponds to S1 . The false results of (17), F
case, form the binary S1 vector while the true results of (17),
T case, form the binary S2 vector, as denoted by the following
equations:

where i = 1, . . . , S − 2. The case i = 1 performs a check for
the definition of the second sound of the PCG signal. Similarly,
for i = S − 2, the semifinal sound is determined. The first and
the last heart sounds of the PCG signal are not included in the
binary S1 , S2 vectors. Hence, if for i = 1 the result of (17) is
true, meaning that the second sound is an S2 , the first sound
[klo c (1):klo c (2)] is defined as an S1 and vice versa. Correspondingly, the last sound [klo c (2S − 1):klo c (2S)] is defined as an
S1 , if for i = S − 2 (17) is true, or as an S2 , if it is false. The
addition of the binary xSb 1 [n], xSb 1 [n] signals including the first
and the last heart sounds provides the segmented binary PCG
signal, defined as

the selected IMFs (sIM F m [n]), as follows:

sounds of the recorded PCG that the physician indicated, SP
for the predicted sounds, i.e., the number of sounds resulted by
the application of the segmentation algorithm, and SC for the
correctly predicted sounds, i.e., the predicted sounds matching
the observed sounds, the prediction power QP of the proposed
method was measured as the geometric means of the ratios
SC /SO and SC /SP


A. Experimental Dataset
The PCG data used for the algorithmic development and
testing of the HSS-EEMD/K scheme were recorded in the 1st
Cardiac Clinic of Papanikolaou General Hospital in Thessaloniki, Greece. The database collected is composed of 52 different subject’s records; in particular, 14 records come from
controls, 19 records come from patients with aortic stenosis,
and 19 records come from patients with mitral regurgitation.
The diagnosis and the severity of the heart valve diseases were
determined by the doctors, based on the echocardiogram of
the patient, according to the recommended standards [47]. The
samples were recorded from the auscultation position of the
chest where the murmur is best heard for each valve dysfunction, while the normal heart sound samples were recorded from
the apex. Recordings from more than one position could be
used; however, they were avoided here, so to simulate a real
auscultation examination with an electronic stethoscope and reduce the complexity of the implementation of the HSS-EEMD/K
scheme, thus ensuring the applicability of the developed scheme
in common clinical practice. From the total dataset, nine records,
three of each category were used for the methodology’s development; thus, the dataset that the HSS-EEMD/K method was tested
on contains 43 heart sound records, 11 records from controls,
16 from patients with aortic stenosis, and 16 from patients with
mitral regurgitation, forming a total of 2602 heart cycles (698 cycles of normal heart sounds, 827 aortic stenosis cycles, and 1077
mitral regurgitation cycles). The testing dataset consists of about
60% samples from women and 40% samples from men, within
an age range of 16–90 years, and cases of medium and severe
heart valve diseases. The characteristics of the testing dataset are
summarized in Table I. The recordings of the heart sounds were
performed using the electronic stethoscope AUDIOSCOPE,
which records the signal amplified and unfiltered, and the software Audacity, with a sampling frequency of 44100 Hz, and a
16-bit resolution. Since normal and abnormal heart sounds have
a frequency range of 50–700 Hz, the original PCG recordings
were down-sampled from 44.1 to 4 kHz, zero-meaned, and normalized to [-1 1]; all sounds were stored in .wav format. The
analysis was carried out on a personal computer using MATLAB
R2011b (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).
B. General Evaluation Indices
In order to produce a gold standard of the heart sounds, a
manual evaluation process, performed by an independent expert physician, took place. The recorded PCGs were audio-

QP = 100

SC SC
.
SO SP

(22)

QP is an overall index that takes into account not only the
detectability efficiency of an algorithm, but also its performance
related to the false positives, i.e., the locations predicted by
the algorithm that are not consistent with existing sounds. For
each heart sound sample, a physician was asked to mark the
peaks of the existing sounds. Then, for i = 0, . . . , SO − 1, the
i + 1 heart sound was assumed to have been correctly predicted
when the area predicted by the algorithm [klo c (2i + 1):klo c (2i +
2)], for i = 0, . . . , SO − 1 enclosed the i + 1 marked peak.
Moreover, the accuracy of the method, seen as the percentage
of the correctly segmented cycles, was estimated as

CP = 100

NC
NO

(23)

where NO is the number of the observed cycles and NC is the
number of the correctly segmented cycles. A cycle is considered
to be correctly segmented when the S1 and S2 are included
in the specific cycle, along with the S2 preceding and the S1
following the cycle are correctly predicted, while there are no
false positives in the distances between them, ensuring that the
durations of diastole and systole are also accurately delimited.

C. Parameter Selection
As far as the parameters used in the implementation of the
HSS-EEMD/K are concerned, the energy contribution parameter ηλ was set equal to 0.99, meaning that the selected Mη IMFs
contain 99% of the signal’s energy. The Bootstrap method’s
number of repetitions b was set equal to 1000 to ensure a statistically large sample of γ̂4λ,b vectors. Probability q was initially
set equal to 0.999. The higher q value, the stricter Gaussianity
test is suggested. However, the estimation of both (10) and (6)
depends on the length of the IMF; consequently, a predefined
single q value may not be suitable for any length N . For the case
that MK = 0, meaning that no E{γ̂4λ,b } lies outside I(N, q), q
is iteratively reduced and the test is repeated until at least one
IMF is included in the ΩK set. Moreover, the kurtosis estimate
was calculated using different sliding windows, with lengths
of, lw = Fs /50:Fs /50:Fs /10 samples, for capturing the fast and
slow changes of the waveform.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Experimental and Evaluation Results
Excerpts from the experimental results derived from the application of the HSS-EEMD/K scheme on the dataset are depicted
in Fig. 4. In all cases, the positions of the peaks, as identified
by the physician, are marked by an asterisk, and the locations
of the sounds limits predicted by the algorithm are marked by
dashed lines to facilitate the visual evaluation of the results.
For the cases of Fig. 4(i)–(iv), (a) corresponds to recorded heart
signals, while (b) corresponds to the segmented reconstructed
signal xr ec [n]. From the comparison of xr ec [n] with x[n], it is
clear that the HSS-EEMD/K successfully predicts the locations
of S1 , S2 and extracts the sounds, both in normal cases [see
Fig. 4(i)] and in cases where severe murmurs are present and
overlapping with the sounds [see Fig. 4(ii) and (iii)]. Moreover,
Fig. 4(iv) shows the efficiency of the HSS-EEMD/K to pick up
the heart sounds in a mild case of mitral regurgitation, where S2
is faded and can hardly be visually identified.
The prediction power and the accuracy of the HSS-EEMD/K
when applied to the experimental dataset are determined using
(22) and (23). Due to the extensive size of the dataset, the
mean values of indices QP and CP , averaged on each data
category and denoted by QP and CP , respectively, are adopted
and shown in Tables II and III in bold. From these tables, it
is clear that the HSS-EEMD/K scheme performs efficiently for
the case of the normal heart sounds, as it correctly predicts
almost all the observed sounds (QP = 99.33%) and correctly
segments almost all 698 heart cycles (CP = 97.98%). Results
for the cases of aortic stenosis (QP = 89.68%, CP = 72.83%)
and mitral regurgitation (QP = 94.68%, CP = 78.35%) are
quite significant; it is, however, obvious that the presence of the

murmurs leads to worse sound detection performance, compared
to the normal case. The lower QP and CP indices of aortic
stenosis are mainly due to the high intensity of the murmurs
present in some samples and to the S2 fading in some cases of
aortic stenosis, which makes the second heart sound hard to be
detected. According to a study in [48], 73% of a group of patients
with aortic stenosis were regarded as having a soft or single S2 ,
while in 9% of the patients, S2 was absent. In the dataset used
here, there are PCGs with an S2 of very low intensity, as well
as parts of murmurs that concur with the ends of the S1 sounds.
The latter is a problem commonly reported in segmentation
approaches, e.g., in [49], a study on fetal phonocardiography,
where the concurrence of parts of S1 and S2 with murmurs
hampers their separation. Overall, the HSS-EEMD/K achieves
a prediction power of 94.56% and an accuracy of 83.05% when
applied to the experimental database. A detailed comparison
with four other HSS methods is discussed in Section V-C.
B. Noise Stress Test
1) Additive Gaussian Noise: In order to examine the robustness of the proposed HSS-EEMD/K scheme, artificial
noise testing, using different levels of noise contamination was
performed. The recorded dataset consists of noisy heart sound
signals and, thus, is inappropriate for the noise stress test, since
the artificial noise would merge with the existing noise, resulting
in an undefined signal-to-noise ratio. However, the performance
of the HSS-EEMD/K method, as it was previously described, allows us to assume that the denoised, reconstructed signal xr ec [n]
serves as a close approximation of an original clean heart sound
signal. Thus, xr ec [n] is ideal to serve as the basis signal on which
the noise test is performed. Note that the proposed method filters
not only the noise present in a PCG, but also the murmur that it
may contain in the cases of a heart valve disease. Nonetheless,
the objective of the proposed method is to detect the locations of
the first and the second heart sounds, classifying the presence of
a murmur as a type of noise. Therefore, using heart sound signals
devoid of murmurs does not eliminate any desirable information. To this end, a xr ec [n] of three heart cycles (six heart sounds
in total) was selected. Then, white Gaussian noise, localized to
be adjusted to the desirable noise level at the occurrences of S1
and S2 was added to the selected xr ec [n]. The robustness of the
method was tested for eight different levels of localized SNRs,
denoted by LSNRs, specifically for noise contamination levels
of {−15, −10, −5, 0, 5, 10, 20, 30 dB}. For each LSNR, white
Gaussian noise was produced and added to the signal 50 times,
leading to a set of 400 noisy signals xn oise [n]. It must also be
noted that the denoised xr ec [n] used was previously guaranteed
the optimum values of the general evaluation indices, i.e., QP =
100% and CP = 100%. The general evaluation indices QP and
CP were calculated for the 400 noisy signals xn oise [n] using
(21) and (22), respectively, and their mean values for the eight
different levels of LSNR, QP and CP , were obtained. Results
of the noise stress test for the HSS-EEMD/K are graphically
presented in error bars in Figs. 5–7(a). QP and CP indices for
different LSNRs for the HSS-EEMD/K scheme are shown in
Figs. 5(i)–(a) and 5(ii)–(a). From these figures, the highly ef-

(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) correspond to the HSS-EEMD/K, HSS-FEM, HSSETS, HSS-ET, and HSS-DWT schemes, respectively.

fective performance of the proposed method is apparent. More
concretely, the QP index rapidly converges to 100% for LSNR
values above 5 dB. For the high noise contamination LSNR of
0 dB, the proposed method still achieves a high mean prediction
power of 87.72%. CP index is also high for the different LSNRs,
approaching 100% for LSNRs above 10 dB, and a value of 76%
for the LSNR of 0 dB.
The filtering that the proposed method performs also allows
for the assessment of its ability to correctly predict the locations
of the sounds starts and ends, as in the reconstructed signal,
xr ec [n], these specific locations are known. To this end, a scoring method was adopted, according to which the samples of
the displacement of the predicted position from the observed
position are counted. In the case of over-estimation, i.e., the
predicted location lies outside the heart sound, the value of the
displacement value is positive. Correspondingly, the negative
value is used in the case of underestimation, i.e., the predicted
location lies within the sound. The method scores zero when the
predicted location coincides with the observed location. Index B
was used to estimate the deviation from the true starts location,
while index E represents the displacement from the observed
ends. The total termini score TS for each sound is calculated as
the sum of the absolute values of the B and E indices, as
T S = |B| + |E|.

(24)

Then, a T S value is characterized as T S 1 , if the termini score
was calculated from an S1 , or T S 2 , if calculated from an S2 .
This grouping is performed due to the fact that S2 sounds tend
to have shorter durations [46]; thus, lower values of mean TS

are expected. The noise stress test evaluation indices B and
E were averaged over the xn oise [n] signals having the same
LSNR and their mean values T S 1 and T S 2 were obtained.
Fig. 6 depicts the termini scores T S 1 [see Fig. 6(i)–(a)] and
T S 2 [see Fig. 6(i)–(b)] for the HSS-EEMD/K scheme. A lower
T S index denotes a smaller deviation from the true locations
of the sounds. At the noise level where the LSNR is equal to
30 dB, the proposed methods T S 1 [see Fig. 6(i)-(a)] is 41.52
samples, while T S 2 [see Fig. 6(ii)–(a)] is 30.23 samples. These
values become meaningful by taking into account the sampling
frequency of 4 kHz. Specifically, the mean B index for S1
and for an LSNR of 30 dB is −11.29 samples, while the E
index for the same conditions is 26.39, corresponding to a delay
in the prediction of the heart sound start location of 2.8 ms
(underestimation) and a delay in the prediction of the heart
sound end location of 6.6 ms (overestimation). The same delays
for the second heart sound at the LSNR of 30 dB are just 1.3
and 4.9 ms respectively. T S 1 and T S 2 gradually increase as the
LSNRs decrease, to reach 105.98 and 95.57, respectively, for
the LSNR of −15 dB.
Another parameter that can be deducted from the noise stress
test implemented is the tendency of the HSS-EEMD/K scheme
to underestimate or overestimate the heart sounds starts and
ends. Fig. 7(a) shows two sounds from the xr ec [n] used in the
noise stress test, whereas Fig. 7(b) depicts the median value of
the positions predicted in each LSNR by the HSS-EEMD/K.
Results for the other two heart cycles of the xr ec [n] were in
accordance with those presented in Fig. 7(b). From the latter,
it is clear that the proposed scheme exhibits a slight tendency
to predict the starts of both sounds after the actual starts and

the ends of the sounds after the actual ends. This tendency
becomes more intense as the LSNR decreases, yet with values
below zero. Moreover, it tends to predict the starts of the sounds
closer to the actual starts, compared to the ends, i.e., B index is
usually smaller in absolute value than E index for a particular
combination of sound and LSNR. This is probably due to the
fact that the start of a sound usually introduces a more abrupt
change in the PCG signal.
2) Respiratory Noise: A second noise test was performed
in order to test the robustness of the HSS-EEMD/K on a PCG
contaminated with respiratory sounds. Following the example
of [50], data of heart sounds (HS[n]), lung sounds (LS[n]),
and their convolution were acquired,1 forming the s[n] signal,
which was then used
as an 
input to the HSS-EEMD/K scheme.
Specifically, s[n] = 2q =1 3k =0 aq k sq [n − k], where s1 [n] =
HS[n], s2 [n] = LS[n], aq is the vector of FIR filter coefficients
(a1 was set equal to [0.8 0.9 1.1 1.2], while a2 = [0.1 0.7
0.7 1.6]) and n = 1, . . . , 24000. Sections of 6000 samples of
the HS[n], LS[n], and s[n] signals are shown in Fig. 8(a)–(c),
respectively. The result of the segmentation and extraction of
s[n], i.e., sr ec [n], is presented in Fig. 8(d). From the latter, the
accurate detection, location, and reconstruction of the HS[n]
can be seen. The indices QP , CP , T S1 , and T S2 were calculated
and the results are presented in Table IV in bold.
Related to the prediction power of the algorithm, HSSEEMD/K was able to detect and extract 21 out of the 22 sounds

correctly, while no false sound was proposed. This led to a correct segmentation of ten out of the 11 heart cycles. The sum
of the deviations from the correct starts and ends location is
low, as it can be deducted from the T S 1 and T S 2 values of
Table III. Overall, the respiratory noise test revealed that the
HSS-EEMD/K scheme performs efficiently even in the case of
respiratory noise.
C. Comparison With Previous Works
The experimental and noise stress test results were compared to the indices values that stemmed from four efficient
HSS methods when applied on the same experimental dataset.
The techniques were chosen to include different methodologies, such as frequency- and energy-based analysis (HSS-FEM
scheme [17]), complexity-based analysis (HSS-ETS scheme
[25]), energy- and topology-based analysis (HSS-ET scheme
[15]), and wavelet-based analysis (HSS-DWT scheme [3]). The
HSS-FEM, HSS-ETS, and HSS-DWT schemes detect the duration of the heart sounds; hence, the same method as the one of
the HSS-EEMD/K scheme was used to determine if one sound is
predicted correctly, i.e., if the peak marked by the physician lies
within the predicted location. However, the HSS-ET methodology detects one peak of each sound, yet not its duration. In order
to determine whether one sound was predicted correctly in this
case, the physician was asked to mark the starts and ends of the
sounds. Then, a located sound was considered to be correctly
predicted when its peak was detected between the marked start
and end for the particular sound.

The corresponding results are tabulated in Tables II and III and
depicted in Figs. 5(i),(ii)–(b):(e), 6(i),(ii)–(b),(d), and 7(c),(e).
From the comparative results, it is evident that the implementation of the HSS-EEMD/K improved the evaluation indices
QP and CP in all three categories of samples and in total (see
Tables II and III). The accuracy of 72% that the HSS-ET method
achieved on the experimental database agrees with the one that
it achieved on Vepa et al. ’s database, according to [25]. Normal
samples present satisfying results for all five methods; however, indices from the application of the algorithms on the valve
diseases samples exhibit a decrement. It can be derived from
Tables II and III that the decrease in both indices QP and CP
for both the categories of the aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation samples is moderately bigger for the HSS-FEM, HSS-ETS,
HSS-ET, and HSS-DWT schemes, when compared to the corresponding decreases of the HSS-EEMD/K scheme for most of
the cases, showing that, overall, its performance appears to be
less dependent on the presence of the murmurs.
For the noise stress test case, the QP and CP indices could be
calculated for all four schemes, yet the T S indices could only
be calculated for the HSS-FEM, HSS-ETS, and the HSS-DWT
schemes. This is owing to the fact that, as mentioned earlier,
the HSS-ET scheme does not suggest a location for the start or
the end of a heart sound but for its peak. Thus, the comparison
was limited to the ability of the algorithms to detect the heart
sounds and to segment the heart cycles. The comparison among
the five methodologies, presented in Fig. 5, reveals that the
HSS-EEMD/K and the HSS-ET schemes clearly exhibit more
robust behavior than HSS-ETS, HSS-FEM, or HSS-DWT. HSSEEMD/K achieves better QP and CP indices for the majority
of LSNRs; there are, however, LSNRs for which the HSS-ET’s
indices exceed the ones of HSS-EEMD/K. For example, for
LSNR of 10 dB, QP of the HSS-ET is 99.67%, exceeding the
99.14% of the HSS-EEMD/K. In the case of the CP index,
the better performance of the HSS-EEMD/K scheme compared
to the one of HSS-ET is clearer, since the curve of the HSSET degrades to a lower degree and with a faster rate, reaching
the mean accuracy of 2.67% for and LSNR of −15 dB. The
same accuracy for the HSS-EEMD/K is considerably higher,
reaching 12.67%. As far as HSS-FEM, HSS-ETS, and HSSDWT schemes are concerned, their indices have lower values
at all LSNRs, indicating that they failed to correctly detect the
sounds and to correctly segment the signals even in lower noise
contamination conditions.
Moreover, both T S 1 and T S 2 of the proposed method have
lower values for all LSNR levels compared to the ones achieved
by the HSS-FEM, the HSS-ETS, or the HSS-DWT scheme (see
Fig. 6). The displacement of the starts and ends true location
increases for all other three methods as the LSNR decreases in
both heart sounds. Note that in Fig. 6(ii)–(d), a value corresponding to the LSNR of −15 dB does not exist, due to the fact that
HSS-DWT failed to detect any second heart sound during the
noise stress test at the particular noise contamination level, thus
a termini score could not be calculated. The low number of the
correctly predicted second heart sounds is probably the cause for
this curve decreasing after the LSNR of 0 dB, as the mean value
calculated derived from few indicative samples. With reference

PAPADANIIL AND HADJILEONTIADIS: EFFICIENT HEART SOUND SEGMENTATION AND EXTRACTION

to the displacement tendencies of the HSS-FEM, the HSS-ETS,
and the HSS-DWT methods, Fig. 7 shows that the HSS-FEM
and HSS-ETS schemes tend to underestimate the duration of
both heart sounds, while the HSS-DWT scheme tends to overestimate them. Once more, the HSS-DWT plot does not have
a value corresponding to the LSNR of −15 dB for the reason
previously mentioned.
Then, all methods were tested on heart sounds contaminated
with a medium flow respiratory signal (see Section V-B.2). The
results of the evaluation indices are presented in Table IV, from
where it can be concluded that the proposed HSS-EEMD/K
scheme detected more sounds compared to the other four approaches; thus, it correctly segmented more cycles, whereas the
locations of the sounds starts and ends were averagely closer
to the real ones, with the HSS-EEMD/K exhibiting the lowest
T S 1 , T S 2 values.
Finally, the contribution of the kurtosis criterion (see
Section III) to the performance of the HSS-EEMD/K scheme
was tested against the well-known statistical significance test
(SST), proposed by Wu and Huang [51], applied on the same
datasets. The experimental results have shown that the adoption
of SST as a means to identify the IMFs with useful information
resulted in a mean of 15–20% reduction of the total prediction
power and accuracy, compared to the kurtosis-based ones, reported in Tables II and III. This is probably due to the existence
of additional sound information sources (e.g., murmurs) at the
IMF level, which, however, are not related to S1 and S2 , and
mislead the SST criterion to include redundant IMFs.
The authors believe that the improvement implemented by the
proposed method is mainly owing to a more effective decomposition of the PCG into its’ distinct components than the WT
decomposition, as well as the lower dependence of the detection
algorithm on amplitude values. Methods that use energy-based
analysis are more prone to miss the low amplitude S2 , which often appears in aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation PCGs, or to
misinterpret the high energy murmurs as sounds. The HSS-FEM
scheme uses both frequency and energy characteristics of the
PCG; however, it requires dataset-based training, which causes
this scheme’s lower performance on the dataset used here and
makes it less favorable for clinical application, where ability to
perform well with new data is essential. In the HSS-EEMD/K
scheme, apart from the parameters of Section IV-C, the rest
were based on heart sounds characteristics-related literature or
were automatically adjusted by the algorithm; thus, the method
is expected to perform well in a wide range of datasets.
D. Sensitivity Analysis
A sensitivity analysis was performed for the parameters used
in the proposed scheme to determine the influence of their variation on the experimental results. The analysis included the parameters not justified by the literature, i.e., energy threshold ηλ
and confidence interval determining probability q and was implemented by repeatedly varying one parameter at a time while
holding the other fixed, as selected in Section IV-C. Then, the
change in the output was measured in terms of the QP index,
averaged over the total dataset. Although q is automatically ad-

index stemmed from the parameter sensitivity analysis for different values of
(a) energy threshold η λ and (b) confidence interval determining probability q.

justed by the algorithm, constant values were assumed for the
sensitivity analysis in order to examine its relation to the results,
which are presented in Fig. 7. From the latter [see Fig. 9(a)], it
can be deducted that the performance of the proposed method
gradually declines as the energy threshold values scale down,
owing mainly to the inability of the algorithm to select IMFs
coinciding with the other two criteria’s selected IMFs for low
energy thresholds (below 0.3) in the case of certain data samples. The output appears to be less correlated with the variations
of the q value [see Fig. 9(b)], indicating that a wide range of
confidence intervals can lead to the selection of the IMFs that
contain the HS characteristics.

E. Computational Cost
The computational cost of the HSS-EEMD/K scheme was
defined by means of measuring the time needed to segment the
heart sounds in a time interval of 1 s, i.e., in a PCG segment of
4000 samples. The time elapsed was 35.32 s, showing that the
implementation needs improvement to be suitable for real-time
analysis. EMD by definition follows an iterative process, whose
computation time depends on the parameters set for the termination criteria. In EEMD, EMD is executed many times and an
ensemble mean is taken from the IMF extracted, which highly
increases the computational time. In the proposed method, 100
noise samples were used to extract the IMFs. However, efforts
are being made to reduce the computational cost of the EMD.
To this direction, the performance of the EMD is investigated in
recent works, as in [52], where a statistical test for the exclusion
of the IMFs with high-level noise components is implemented,
thus, decreasing the processing time of the algorithm. Such techniques can be applied to the proposed method to increase its performance. The time needed for the proposed scheme to segment
the cycle after EEMD is performed declines in 3.17 s, proving
that EEMD is principally responsible for the long overall computational time. The times measured for the segmentation of the
same PCG section are 0.36 s for the HSS-FEM scheme, 4 s for
the HSS-ETS scheme, 0.14 s for the HSS-ET scheme, and 0.37 s
for the HSS-DWT scheme, on an IBM-PC [Intel(R) Core(TM)
i7 CPU/2.67 GHz].

G. Overall Perspective

Fig. 10. Separation of a first heart sound into its three phases P 1 , P 2 , and
P 3 . (a) S 1 sound of the original PCG. (b) Absolute kurtosis first derivative,
estimated on the second IMF along a sliding window of 140 samples. The
dashed lines indicate the locations of the proposed phase separation, defined as
the positions of the local maxima of the absolute kurtosis derivative.

F. Phase Separation
The duration of normal heart sounds was studied in [46]. According to this paper, the first and the second heart sounds consist
of various vibrations having different frequencies. The extreme
variability of the complexes of the heart sounds can make the
separation of the components impossible in some cases. They
developed, however, a simplified method to divide the sounds
into three components, based on the idea that in both heart
sounds, the main part of the sound includes larger vibrations,
while the beginning and the end of the sound is formed by slower
vibrations. As analyzed in Section II-C, kurtosis is able to detect
the occurrences in a heart sound signal by detecting the deviations from Gaussianity. The kurtosis estimated along a sliding
window presents peaks at the starts and the ends of the sounds,
denoting the change of an event, as seen on the presentation of
the proposed method (see Section III-C). It has been observed
in many cases of sounds of the recorded database, especially in
sounds belonging in the category of the normal samples, that
the kurtosis vectors present peak values within a heart sound,
implying some change of event within the sound. This becomes
clearer when kurtosis is estimated using short-duration sliding
windows, where shorter events also cause a sharp rise of the kurtosis value. An example is shown in Fig. 10, where the kurtosis
is calculated on a selected IMF of a 500-sample S1 signal from a
normal case [see Fig. 10(a)], using a sliding window of 140 samples and its absolute first derivative is obtained [see Fig. 10(b)].
The signal contains one first heart sound. From Fig. 10, it can
be seen that the local maxima of the absolute kurtosis derivative
vector propose a separation of the sound into three phases P1 ,
P2 , and P3 , which is consistent with the separation made by
Luisada et al. [46]. No methods of segmenting a heart sound
into its components were found in the literature; nevertheless,
indications of the kurtosis estimation show that it could be used
toward this purpose for a deeper analysis of the heart sounds.
The elaboration of this indicative result is left for a future work.

The results that have stemmed from the application of the
HSS-EEMD/K scheme to the recorded dataset and from the
noise stress test in overall surpass the ones of the HSS-FEM,
HSS-ETS, HSS-ET, and HSS-DWT. However, they may not
seem high enough in some cases. These are the cases of the mean
prediction power QP , and especially the mean accuracy CP in
the categories of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. It has to
be noted that the experimental dataset, recorded under hospital
conditions, includes recordings of noisy ambience and samples
of severe valve diseases, whose murmur can be very intense
and overlapping with the first sound, hindering the detection of
the sound and the prediction of its correct location. Moreover,
there are cases where the second sound has completely faded,
making the segmentation of the heart cycles impossible. Complete heart sound databases are available online; however, their
main purpose being educational, they are deprived of any environmental noise and the cases of heart valve sounds chosen are
such that the murmur can be distinguishable from the S1 and
S2 sounds. Numerous previous works have used such databases
to test their algorithms. Using this approach for the proposed
method would most likely bring forth better sound detection and
segmentation results; nevertheless, they would not correspond
to the real results of the application of the method in actual clinical circumstances. Remarkably, a single, established database
which would allow the objective comparison between the different HSS methodologies database has not yet been designed.
However, this being the case, it is possible that many methods
would adjust their parameters to achieve good results on the particular database. Moreover, as far as the CP index is concerned,
the criterion chosen for a heart cycle to be considered correctly
segmented is considerably strict. Previous works do not mention
their method followed to determine whether a heart cycle has
been correctly segmented. Alternative approaches could be that
a cycle is correctly segmented when its two sounds, the diastolic
period prior to the first sound and the systolic period between
the sounds, or the two sounds, the systolic period and the diastolic period after the second sound, are correctly predicted. The
method adopted here, to denote a cycle correctly segmented
when the two sounds, the diastolic periods before and after and
the systolic in between, are correctly predicted, ensures that a
segmented cycle will be correct from any point of the cycle,
but decreases the value of CP in the cases that there are falsely
predicted sounds along the soundless parts of the cycles.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The HSS-EEMD-K scheme, a HSS and extraction method
that employs ensemble EMD and kurtosis features proposed in
this study, proved to be a promising tool for the detection and extraction of the first and second heart sounds, the determination of
their durations, and the separation of the heart cycle into its four
components (diastole-S1 -systole-S2 ). The method was tested on
an experimental database, recorded in real clinical environment,
including normal heart sound samples, samples of aortic stenosis, and samples of mitral regurgitation. Given the difficulty
posed by the recorded dataset, the experimental results show

PAPADANIIL AND HADJILEONTIADIS: EFFICIENT HEART SOUND SEGMENTATION AND EXTRACTION

reliable performance of the proposed method. Moreover, the
extensive noise stress test implemented revealed its high robustness. The HSS-EEMD/K scheme can easily be implemented,
and its computational cost can be reduced by improving the processing time of the EMD algorithm. Moreover, indications from
the EEMD-based filtering and kurtosis estimation on a heart
sound signal shed light upon a further segmentation; the separation of a sound into its structures. Comparison with other works
validated the superior performance of the proposed scheme, in
terms of detection power, accuracy, and noise robustness. Future work will focus upon the extension of the HSS-EEMD/K
to the case of murmur identification and extraction from the raw
PCG, facilitating the feature extraction process and the use of
the segmented PCGs to build a valve disease identification tool.
