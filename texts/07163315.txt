Abstract—Goal: We propose a novel wireless fully passive neural recording device for unobtrusive neuropotential monitoring.
Previous work demonstrated the feasibility of monitoring emulated brain signals in a wireless fully passive manner. In this paper,
we propose a novel realistic recorder that is significantly smaller
and much more sensitive. Methods: The proposed recorder utilizes a highly efficient microwave backscattering method and operates without any formal power supply or regulating elements.
Also, no intracranial wires or cables are required. In-vitro testing
is performed inside a four-layer head phantom (skin, bone, gray
matter, and white matter). Results: Compared to our former implementation, the neural recorder proposed in this study has the
following improved features: 1) 59% smaller footprint, 2) up to
20-dB improvement in neuropotential detection sensitivity, and 3)
encapsulation in biocompatible polymer. Conclusion: For the first
time, temporal emulated neuropotentials as low as 63 μVp p can be
detected in a wireless fully passive manner. Remarkably, the highsensitivity achieved in this study implies reading of most neural
signals generated by the human brain. Significance: The proposed
recorder brings forward transformational possibilities in wireless
fully passive neural detection for a very wide range of applications
(e.g., epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, mental disorders, etc.).

I. INTRODUCTION
RAIN implant technology has a strong potential to improve the individual’s well-being. Example applications
include early detection of epileptic seizures, treatments and
prosthetics for the disabled, understanding and improving the
brain’s functionality for people with Alzheimer’s, mental disorders, addictions, etc. [1]–[5]. However, current/in-research brain
implants lack the safety and reliability required for unobtrusive
long-term monitoring of neuropotentials.
Specifically, in several cases, wires have been used to connect intracranial clinical implants to the exterior monitoring
units [3], [6]. As would be expected, recording of neural data

under tethered connections is restricted to clinical studies in
static environments. This limits the range of possible brain science research and applications. Recently, the aforementioned
limitation has been overcome using wireless brain implants.
Nevertheless, a number of safety-related issues still exist. For
example, the work in [7] and [8] considered wireless neural tags
for RFID-inspired brain–machine interfaces. Though batteries
were avoided, RF-to-DC converters and power storage devices
were still used, implying heat generation issues. This heating
might disturb normal brain operation and eventually damage
the cerebral tissue [9], [10]. In another case [11], a wireless
neurosensor was presented for recording electrophysiological
signals from the cortex of monkeys. However, the latter neurosensor employed a head-mounted device with a “screw-on”
interconnect to the implant. That is, the skull was always perforated by wires, limiting natural lifestyle and comfort, if such a
system pursues for human subjects.
As an alternative, we aim to establish a novel technology
for carefree, safe, and reliable brain implants. Our objectives
entail: 1) fully passive implants (no battery, energy harvesting
unit, or rectifier/regulator), 2) wireless operation for unobtrusive
monitoring with minimum impact to the individual’s activity, 3)
extremely simple electronics that generate minimal heat, and
4) tiny footprint to minimize trauma [12], [13]. Recently, we
demonstrated a proof-of-concept wireless fully passive neural
recording device with high detection sensitivity [13]. Specifically, in frequency domain, the implant in [13] could detect
emulated brain signals of 200 μVpp at fneuro = 100 Hz, to as
low as 50 μVpp at fneuro = 1 kHz. In time domain, the aforementioned device could detect neuropotentials of 670 μVpp at
fneuro = 100 Hz, to as low as 200 μVpp at fneuro = 1 kHz.
However, to be able to read all neural signals generated by the
human brain (see Table I [1], [14]–[16]), further improvement in
sensitivity is needed. We also remark that the proof-of-concept
implant reported in [13] was big (footprint of 39 mm × 15 mm)
and non-biocompatible. Thus, it was unsuitable for realistic applications.
In this paper, we build upon our previous work [13] to design
a novel wireless fully passive neural recording device that: 1)

sitivity (viz., 10× better). Also, the neurosensing system now
integrates a synchronous RF demodulator. The latter is used
to downconvert the detected neuropotentials to baseband and
display the retrieved temporal waveforms on an oscilloscope.
The wireless and fully passive acquisition of neural signals
deploys the microwave backscattering effect [12]. In brief, onboard nonlinear components, viz., diodes, mix an externally supplied high-frequency microwave carrier with the low-frequency
neural signals. The mixing products are then backscattered to the
external reader where the original neural signals are retrieved.
Fig. 1 illustrates the neurosensing system block diagram. The
exterior interrogator sends a carrier (2.4 GHz) to activate the
recorder. That, in return, detects brain signals (fneuro ) via a pair
of wires/electrodes and mixes them with the carrier to generate
third-order mixing products at 4.8 GHz ± fneuro . The latter are
then transmitted back to the interrogator. Harmonic mixing at
twice the carrier frequency is selected so as to enhance isolation
between the transmit (2.4 GHz) and receive (4.8 GHz ± fneuro )
signals. For wireless transmission, a pair of highly coupled antennas are employed, viz., a 0.6–6 GHz interrogator spiral [13],
[21], and a dual-band (2.4/4.8 GHz) implanted patch.
At the interrogator, the backscattered signals (4.8 GHz ±
fneuro ) can be viewed through a spectrum analyzer (frequency
domain), or demodulated and displayed on an oscilloscope (time
domain). In this study, an RF synchronous demodulator was employed [22], [23]. A simplified version of this demodulator is
shown in Fig. 1. In brief, the demodulator mixes the received signals (4.8 GHz ± fneuro ) with a reference 4.8 GHz to retrieve the
baseband neuropotentials (fneuro ). To improve the final signalto-noise ratio, multiple stages of filtering and amplification were
used [23].

has 59% smaller footprint, 2) exhibits up to 20-dB improvement
in neuropotential detection sensitivity, and 3) is encapsulated
in biocompatible polymer. To mimic realistic implantation
scenarios, the device is tested inside a four-layer (skin, bone,
gray matter, white matter) head phantom [17], [18]. For the first
time, temporal emulated neuropotentials as low as 63 μVpp can
be detected. Thus, most neural signals generated by the human
brain (see Table I) can now be recorded in a fully passive
and wireless manner. In doing so, the neural recorder brings
forward transformational possibilities for a very wide range of
applications.
II. NEUROSENSING SYSTEM OVERVIEW
The block diagram of our neurosensing system is summarized
in Fig. 1. It consists of 1) the implanted sensor to be placed just
above the gray matter of the human brain, and 2) the exterior
interrogator, placed right outside the scalp and can be incorporated within a cap or a textile band [20]. Compared to [13], the
neural recording device employed in this study is significantly
smaller and biocompatible and has much higher detection sen-

The neural recorder consists of: 1) the miniaturized dual-band
(2.4/4.8 GHz) antenna that receives the carrier signal at 2.4 GHz
and backscatters the third-order mixing products at 4.8 GHz ±
fneuro , and 2) the circuit that mixes the neural signals (fneuro )
with the carrier to backscatter 4.8 GHz ± fneuro . Mixing is
performed via a high-efficiency subharmonic mixer employing
an antiparallel diode pair (APDP). This is a unique aspect of
our design and was analyzed in [13]. In this study, we further
improve the mixing efficiency, by employing a capacitor and
an inductor in parallel to the APDP mixer (see Fig. 1) [24]: the
capacitor (100 pF) provided the path to ground for the highfrequency carrier (2.4 GHz), whereas the inductor (6.8 μH)
provided the path to ground for the low-frequency neuropotentials (fneuro ). A matching capacitor (0.1 pF) was also used to
match the impedance of the miniaturized antenna to that of the
mixer.
Fig. 2 shows the recorder design. It has a footprint of 16 mm
× 15 mm, viz. 59% smaller than our former implementation
[13]. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the key idea for miniaturization was
to “fold” our former implant [13] approximately into two, and
redesign accordingly. Specifically, the device in [13] employed
a single substrate layer, or, equivalently, two metallization
layers. The on-board circuit and antenna were printed on the top

match losses between the on-board antenna and mixer circuit.
The fabricated prototype is shown in Fig. 2(c). FR-4 substrate
(εr = 4.6, tanδ = 0.016) layers were used, each with a thickness
of 31 mils (0.789 mm). To ensure biocompatibility, a bubblefree PDMS mixture was carefully poured onto the implant. A
curing process was then conducted under elevated temperature
(∼100 °C).
Table II highlights the unique features of the proposed
recorder versus previously reported wireless devices. To our
knowledge, [12] and [13] are the only wireless fully passive
neural recorders reported to date. However, the recorder in [12]
could not read most of the signals generated by the human brain
(see Table I). The recorder in [13] had much higher sensitivity,
but it was bulky and not biocompatible. In this paper, we build
upon the operating principles reported in [13] to develop a novel,
realistic, recorder that can read almost all signals generated by
the human brain (see Table I) and has much smaller footprint,
16 × 15 mm2 . We remark that the large sensitivity improvement of the proposed design is attributed to: 1) new implanted
antenna that exhibits much higher coupling with the exterior
interrogating antenna, 2) improved matching between the implanted circuit and antenna, and 3) improved performance of
the implanted mixer. The latter was mainly due to the inclusion
of the 6.8-μH inductor that provided a path to ground for the
low-frequency neuropotentials (fneuro ).
IV. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE

metallization layer, while the ground plane was printed on the
bottom metallization layer. Instead, the neural recorder in this
study employs two substrate layers (of 59% smaller footprint
than [13]), or, equivalently, three metallization layers. The
on-board circuit, antenna, and ground plane were printed on
the bottom, top, and middle metallization layer, respectively.
A plated via was then used to connect the circuit and antenna
to ground. The employed dual-band (2.4/4.8 GHz) on-board
antenna was a modified version of the one presented in [13]. Its
design is shown in Fig. 2(b).
To ensure biocompatibility, the recorder was coated with a
thin layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer (εr = 2.8,
tanδ = 0.001). We remark that PDMS has very similar electrical
properties to Silastic MDX4–4210 Biomedical Grade Elastomer
[25], which has long been used in medical implants. Concurrently, this coating acts as a low-loss superstrate to the antenna,
reducing power absorbed by the human body, and increasing the
transmission coefficient between the on-board and interrogator
antennas [26], [27]. This implies reduction of the overall system loss and, thus, improvement of the system’s neuropotential
detection sensitivity.
As would be expected, in designing the circuit and antenna,
we took into account the effect of 1) both substrate layers, 2) surrounding polymer coating, and 3) plated via. The mixer circuit
was optimized for low conversion loss using Harmonic Balance
analysis in Agilent Advanced Design System (ADS). The implanted antenna was optimized in ANSYS HFSS to achieve high
transmission coefficient (|S21 |) at 2.4 and 4.8 GHz in presence
of the exterior interrogator spiral [13]. Finally, the matching
capacitor (see Fig. 1) was optimized in ADS to minimize mis-

A. Measurement Setup
The measurement setup used to assess the sensitivity (i.e.,
the minimum detectable emulated neuropotentials) of the neurosensing system is shown in Fig. 3. The 2.4-GHz carrier was
generated by a signal generator (transmit power of 16 dBm)
and fed to the interrogator spiral antenna via a circulator. Emulated neuropotentials at fneuro = 100 Hz–5 kHz were generated
through an arbitrary waveform generator. The recorder was immersed inside a four-layer head phantom that emulated skin,
bone, gray matter, and white matter tissues. We remark that,
for the ease of experimental testing, the dura and gray matter
layers were combined as one [18]. The latter was made possible
since the dura layer 1) is very thin (< 0.5 mm) and 2) has very
similar electrical properties to gray matter [19]. Fig. 3 shows
the implant’s position with respect to the stacked layers, as well
as the individual layer thicknesses.
Phantom formulas were adapted from [17] and are given
in Table III. In brief, polyethylene powder and sodium chloride (NaCl) were used to adjust the phantom’s permittivity and
conductivity, respectively. Self-shaping was made possible with
agar, while TX-151 was used to increase the mixture’s viscosity.
Boric acid was finally added as a preservative.
The permittivity and conductivity of each emulated tissue
were measured using the Agilent 85070E Dielectric Probe Kit.
Measured versus reference (“target”) [19] electrical properties
are shown in Fig. 4 as a function of frequency. As seen, good
agreement exists throughout the entire frequency range of interest. For all layers, measured permittivity at 2.4 and 4.8 GHz
was within ±4.3 error from the reference values. Measured

calculated by subtracting the received sideband power level (at
4.8 GHz ± fneuro ) from the generated neuropotential power (at
fneuro ). We note that system loss (Lsys ) may be defined as

conductivity at 2.4 and 4.8 GHz was within ±0.6 error from the
reference values.
B. System Sensitivity
1) Frequency-Domain Performance: The received (4.8 GHz
± fneuro ) signals were first detected via a spectrum analyzer at
the interrogator side (see Fig. 1). An example measured spectral

(1)

where Lconv is the mixer conversion loss, Lpropag is the propagation loss (i.e., transmission loss, |S21 | between the on-board
and interrogator antennas), and Lm atch is the matching loss between the on-board antenna and mixer circuit. This breakdown
is very useful in the design phase, as minimization of each individual loss component improves the overall system sensitivity
accordingly. As shown in Fig. 5, system loss was measured to
be 40 dB at fneuro = 100 Hz–5 kHz. This was only ∼4 dB
higher than simulations, likely due to diode packaging losses
and discrepancies in phantom layer thicknesses. Remarkably,
compared to our former implementation [13], the neurosensing
system exhibits up to 20-dB lower loss. Of course, this implies
an equivalent, 20 dB, improvement in system sensitivity. Assuming a minimum detectable signal of −130 dBm at the spectrum
analyzer [13], frequency-domain emulated neural signals as low
as 20 μVpp can be detected at fneuro = 100 Hz–5 kHz. This is
an up to 10× improvement in sensitivity compared to [13].
2) Time-Domain Performance: To assess the minimum detectable emulated neuropotentials of the neurosensing system in
time domain, we proceeded to downconvert the backscattered
(4.8 GHz ± fneuro ) signals to baseband (fneuro ). To do so, we
employed an RF synchronous demodulator at the interrogator

side (see Fig. 1). The recovered emulated neuropotentials were
then viewed through an oscilloscope. Fig. 6 shows the minimum
detectable emulated neuropotentials in time domain. The latter
were obtained as
M DSNeuro [dBm] = M DSR X [dBm] + Lsys [dB]

(2)

where M DSR x is the minimum detectable signal at the receiver, and Lsys is the system loss from (1). For the employed
interrogator, M DSR X was
M DSR X [dBm] = kT (dBm/Hz) + log10 5kHz + NF + SNR
= −174 + 37 + 4 + 13 = −120 dBm

where kT is the thermal noise power, NF is the receiver noise
figure, and SNR is the receiver signal-to-noise ratio. As seen in
Fig. 6, the neurosensing system can detect temporal emulated
brain signals as low as 63 μVpp at fneuro = 100 Hz–5 kHz.
Compared to our previous implementation [13], this is an up to
10× improvement in sensitivity. Importantly, this high sensitivity implies reading of most signals generated by the human brain
in a fully passive and wireless manner (see Table I). Example
input versus recovered emulated neuropotential waveforms are
shown in the inset of Fig. 6.

C. Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) Performance
To assess conformance of the neurosensing system to patient safety guidelines, we carried out numerical SAR studies in ANSYS HFSS. For these studies, we considered a 10cm-radius spherical head model [37] consisting of skin, bone,
gray matter, and white matter tissues. The recorder was placed
in between the dura and gray matter, while the interrogator
antenna was placed right outside the scalp. The SAR distribution at 2.4 GHz averaged over 10 g of tissue is shown in
Fig. 7. The latter is for a transmit interrogator power of 16
dBm. As seen, SAR10g,m ax = 1.65 W/kg. Therefore, the neurosensing system satisfies the IEEE C95.1-2005 [38] guidelines
for uncontrolled environment exposure, viz. SAR10g,m ax < 2
W/kg. We also note that SAR1g,m ax = 7.38 W/kg. Therefore,
at this point, the system further satisfies the FCC [39] safety
guidelines for controlled environment exposure, viz. SAR1g,m ax
< 8 W/kg. Future implementations will consider further reduction of the interrogator’s transmit power levels.
V. CONCLUSION
A wireless fully passive neurosensing system was presented
for continuous and unobtrusive monitoring of very low voltage
brain signals. This type of fully passive and wireless neuropotential acquisition has the unique property of very minor heating,
thus minimizing injury and trauma to the brain while preserving
natural lifestyle and comfort. Our previous work had demonstrated the feasibility of monitoring emulated brain signals in
a wireless fully passive manner. In this paper, we took a major
step forward by proposing a novel, realistic, recorder that exhibits the following unique features: 1) 59% smaller footprint,
2) up to 20-dB improvement in sensitivity, and 3) encapsulation
in biocompatible polymer. To better reflect the actual implantation scenario, in-vitro testing was performed inside a four-layer
(skin, bone, gray matter, white matter) head phantom.
For the first time, detection of emulated temporal neural signals as low as 63 μVpp was demonstrated, viz., up to 10× lower
than [13]. This high sensitivity implies that most signals generated by the human brain can be read in a fully passive and
wireless manner. In doing so, the neurosensing system brings
forward novel capabilities for a very wide range of applications
(e.g., epilepsy monitoring, prosthetics control, early seizure detection, trauma assessment, etc).
Future work will include further implant miniaturization and
in-vivo testing inside animal models.
