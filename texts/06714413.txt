Abstract—We demonstrate the feasibility of using highfrequency microwaves for tissue ablation by comparing the performance of a 10 GHz microwave ablation system with that of a
1.9 GHz system. Two sets of floating sleeve dipole antennas operating at these frequencies were designed and fabricated for use in
ex vivo experiments with bovine livers. Combined electromagnetic
and transient thermal simulations were conducted to analyze the
performance of these antennas. Subsequently, a total of 16 ablation
experiments (eight at 1.9 GHz and eight at 10.0 GHz) were conducted at a power level of 42 W for either 5 or 10 min. In all cases,
the 1.9 and 10 GHz experiments resulted in comparable ablation
zone dimensions. Temperature monitoring probes revealed faster
heating rates in the immediate vicinity of the 10.0 GHz antenna
compared to the 1.9 GHz antenna, along with a slightly delayed
onset of heating farther from the 10 GHz antenna, suggesting that
heat conduction plays a greater role at higher microwave frequencies in achieving a comparably sized ablation zone. The results obtained from these experiments agree very well with the combined
electromagnetic/thermal simulation results. These simulations and
experiments show that using lower frequency microwaves does not
offer any significant advantages, in terms of the achievable ablation zones, over using higher frequency microwaves. Indeed, it
is demonstrated that high-frequency microwave antennas may be
used to create reasonably large ablation zones. Higher frequencies
offer the advantage of smaller antenna size, which is expected to
lead to less invasive interstitial devices and may possibly lead to
the development of more compact multielement arrays with heating properties not available from single-element antennas.

[1]–[7]). In MWA, an interstitial antenna is typically used to
deliver microwave energy into the tissue and heat it up to temperature levels that result in immediate cell death. A number of
studies have examined tissue ablation at microwave frequencies
using different types of interstitial antennas (e.g., [7]–[20]). In
most of these studies, the antenna is fed with a coaxial cable and
the topology of the antenna and its feed structure are optimized
to achieve the desired heating pattern while choking the currents
flowing on the outer surface of the outer conductor of the feeding coaxial cable. Specific examples of these designs include
the floating sleeve dipole (FSD) [8], choke [9], triaxial [10], and
cap-choke [14], [15] antennas. While many different antenna
types and designs have been examined for MWA, the vast majority of these studies share a common trait. Namely, they have
examined MWA at frequencies below 2.5 GHz (e.g., [7]–[16]).
In fact, most of the studies reported in this area to date have
used frequencies around 915 MHz (e.g., [3]–[4], [15], [16]) and
2.45 GHz (e.g., [5]–[14]) for ablation purposes.
A careful review of the literature in this area reveals only a few
studies that have examined using higher frequencies for MWA
applications. In [17], a 9.2-GHz endometrial ablation system
was developed for treatment of abnormal menstrual bleeding;
the frequency was chosen so that the total depth of heating
matched the endometrial thickness [18]. In [19] and [20], a
multifunctional antenna operating at 14.5 GHz was proposed
for both tissue ablation and characterization and examined for
treatment of liver cancer. The frequency 14.5 GHz was reported
to be optimal for both high-power ablation and low-power characterization [19]. In [21], 18 GHz was identified as the optimum
frequency in the 0.9–30 GHz range for MWA of xenografted
mice tumors with high tissue specificity (low collateral damage)
and high efficiency (low input power). These studies, however,
are exceptions rather than the norm.
The widespread availability of high-power generators at
915 MHz and 2.45 GHz and the FCC allocation of those bands
for industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) use are two practical factors that have motivated the use of low frequencies in
MWA. However, these are not limiting factors, as higher frequency sources as well as higher frequency ISM bands are readily available. In terms of technical considerations, the choice
of low frequencies has been driven by concerns that smaller
penetration depths at higher electromagnetic frequencies would
preclude the creation of sufficiently large ablation volumes. In
fact, factors other than frequency may have a greater influence on the effective penetration depth of microwave radiation

from interstitial applicators [26]. However, assumptions about
penetration-depth constraints have not been extensively tested.
In this paper, we examine the use of higher frequency microwaves for tissue ablation and compare with lower frequency
MWA performance. Two interstitial FSD antennas operating at
10.0 and 1.9 GHz are used in ex vivo ablation experiments conducted in fresh bovine livers. The antennas are based on the
design reported in [8]. FSDs are easy to implement, provide localized specific absorption rate (SAR) patterns, and efficiently
choke the currents flowing on the outer surface of the outer
conductors of the feeding coaxial cables to avoid heating the
tissue along the insertion path of the antennas. In both the 10and 1.9-GHz experiments, the same ablation time (5 or 10 min)
and input power level (42 W) are used. The dimensions of the
ablation zones achieved at 10.0 GHz are found to be comparable
to those achieved at 1.9 GHz. Additionally, the heating rates in
the vicinity of the antenna are higher in the 10-GHz experiments
than in the 1.9-GHz experiments.
These experimental results suggest that the penetration depth
of propagating electromagnetic waves in lossy biological tissues
is not the most appropriate metric for determining the suitability
(or lack thereof) of a given frequency for tissue ablation. Moreover, these results suggest that using a relatively low microwave
frequency (such as 1.9 GHz) does not offer any advantages over
using higher frequencies (on the order of 10.0 GHz) in terms of
the ablation sizes that may be achieved. Using high-frequency
microwaves, however, offers a number of practical advantages.
Specifically, at higher frequencies, smaller and potentially less
intrusive antennas may be used for tissue ablation. Furthermore,
smaller antennas permit the design of compact multielement arrays that may potentially generate heating patterns which are not
easily achieved with a single low-frequency interstitial antenna.
II. ANTENNA DESIGN AND SIMULATION
Fig. 1 shows the longitudinal side view and the cross-sectional
view of the FSD antennas used in these experiments. Each antenna is composed of a main feeding coaxial cable with a dipole
at the end. The dipole has arm lengths of ha and hb and a gap
length of g. A floating sleeve with a length of hs is used to
choke the RF currents excited on the outer surface of the outer
conductor of the feeding coaxial cable. This helps prevent the
heating of tissue along the insertion path of the antennas and
also makes the response of the antenna independent of the insertion depth into the tissue [8]. The entire structure is embedded

in a Teflon catheter as shown in Fig. 1(a) and 1(b). Two sets of
FSD antennas operating at 1.9 and 10.0 GHz are designed for
ablation experiments in bovine liver.

The Cole–Cole parameters (∞ , Δ, τ , and σi ) are determined

The values of the quadratic coefficients are given in Table I.
The SAR, defined as the power dissipated per unit volume
[W/m3 ] normalized by the tissue mass density [kg/m3 ], provides a measure of the amount of microwave energy absorbed
in the tissue. The spatial variation in SAR in the region of tissue
surrounding the antenna is calculated for each of the two FSD
antennas using full-wave computational electromagnetic simulations in CST Microwave Studio. The dimensions (ha , hb , hs ,
and g) of each antenna are tuned to ensure that it is impedance
matched and provides a localized SAR pattern at the desired
frequency of operation. The final optimized dimensions of both
antennas are provided in the caption of Fig. 1 and Table II. For
additional details about the principles of operation of a FSD
antenna, the reader is referred to [8].
Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) show the normalized SAR in the vicinity of
the 10.0-GHz and the 1.9-GHz FSD antennas, respectively. In
both antennas, the SAR levels are reduced by at least 20 dB at
the edge of the floating sleeve compared to the peak SAR value.
This indicates that the floating sleeves effectively suppress the
currents excited on the outer surface of the outer conductor of
the feeding coaxial cable as indicated in [8]. Fig. 2(c) shows the

−25 dB contours of both the 1.9- and 10-GHz antennas plotted in
the same graph, along with the outline of the catheter, to allow
for direct comparison. We observe that the −25 dB contour
for the SAR pattern of the 1.9-GHz antenna encompasses a
larger volume compared to that of the 10.0-GHz antenna. This
is indeed due to the larger penetration depth of electromagnetic
waves at 1.9 GHz compared to that at 10.0 GHz. However, as
will be shown later, this does not adversely affect the size of
the ablation zones that may be achieved using the 10-GHz FSD
antenna.

We also examined the expected heating patterns using combined electromagnetic/thermal simulations in CST Multiphysics
Studio. The assumed thermal properties of copper, Teflon, liver,
and air are listed in Table III. The thermal properties and mass
density of liver are taken from [23]. First, we simulated the ex
vivo case where there is no metabolic heat generation or blood
perfusion. In these ex vivo simulations, the liver is assumed
to be at the room temperature (20◦ C) before ablation. Subsequently, in a second round of thermal simulations, we included
the effects of metabolic heat generation and blood perfusion to
simulate the in vivo performance of MWA at the two frequencies. We assumed a heat generation rate of 10.41 W/kg and
blood perfusion rate of 1000 ml/kg/min. For each simulation,
the calculated microwave power dissipation per unit volume
within the bovine liver, scaled for an input power of 42 W, is
used as the external heat source.
In all of these simulations, the liver is modeled as a homogeneous tissue. Moreover, changes in the physical properties of
tissue that occur during ablation (e.g., temperature-dependent
dielectric properties) and thermodynamic mechanisms such as
the latent heat of water vaporization are not taken into account.
These will inevitably introduce some discrepancies between the
results obtained in these simulations and those obtained from
the ex vivo ablation experiments. Nonetheless, these simplified
simulations do provide useful information about the relative performance of the 1.9 and 10 GHz systems in both ex vivo and in
vivo ablation scenarios.
Fig. 3 shows the results of the transient thermal simulation
for the 10.0-GHz FSD antenna at different observation times
after the start of the ablation procedure. Specifically, the graph
shows the boundary of the 60 ◦ C temperature contours of the ex
vivo (black curves) and the in vivo (red curves) simulation at
different observation times. We chose 60 ◦ C, the median temperature of the congestive zone [24], to define the ablation zone
boundary for the purpose of estimating the dimensions of the
ablation zone. The temperature inside the volume bounded by
each contour is higher than 60 ◦ C. Fig. 4 shows the results of a
similar transient thermal simulation conducted for the 1.9-GHz
FSD antenna. For each antenna, the high-temperature regions
first appear around the slot and arms and then expand as time
increases. Upon comparing the results shown in Fig. 3(b) and
Fig. 4(b) for both ex vivo and in vivo cases, we see that for
shorter ablation times (e.g., 1 min), the ablation zone provided
by the 10-GHz antenna is larger than the one provided by the
1.9-GHz antenna. This larger ablation zone may be explained
by examining the SAR patterns shown in Fig. 2. As shown
in Fig. 2(c), the energy provided to the 10.0-GHz antenna is

deposited in a smaller volume compared to the volume at
1.9 GHz. Therefore, the thermal energy density in the vicinity of
the 10-GHz antenna is higher, which results in a faster temperature rise compared to the 1.9-GHz case. As the ablation time
increases, however, the sizes of the ablation zones in the ex vivo
simulations of the two FSD antennas become comparable. This
is particularly evident from the 5-min-ablation results shown
in Figs. 3(e) and 4(e) and the 10-min-ablation results shown in
Figs. 3(f) and 4(f). Thus, the large ablation volume of the 1.9GHz antenna may be primarily attributed to the large volume
in which this antenna deposits the input microwave energy [see
Fig. 2(b)]. For the 10-GHz antenna, however, the smaller energy
deposition volume does not appear to adversely impact the size
of the ablation zone, as experimentally confirmed in Section III.
This is due to the thermal diffusion process that transfers heat
from the direct-microwave-absorption areas in the immediate
vicinity of the 10.0-GHz FSD antenna to the surrounding areas.
Therefore, even though these distant regions do not absorb a
significant part of the input microwave energy [see Fig. 2(a)],
they nonetheless get hot enough to cause ablation on time scales
that are comparable to (or even faster than) those associated with
low-frequency MWA.
Comparison between the ex vivo and in vivo simulations of
each antenna in Figs. 3 and 4 shows that the effect of blood
perfusion has significant impact on the size of the achievable
ablation zones at both frequencies. For both antennas, the in
vivo ablation zones reach their steady-state dimensions after
a short ablation time (e.g., 2 min) and their largest short-axis
diameters (measured on the y-axis) achieved at the end of 10 min
are approximately half the size of those achieved in the ex vivo

case. The cooling effects of the blood perfusion result in the
reduction of the ablation zone dimensions for both the 1.9GHz and the 10-GHz systems. However, the 10-GHz antenna,
which delivers higher-density energy in the central heating zone,
creates a slightly larger ablation zone compared to the 1.9-GHz
antenna as shown in Figs. 3 and 4.
III. ABLATION EXPERIMENTS
The 1.9- and 10.0-GHz FSD antennas were fabricated out of
50 Ω UT-085C-LL semi-rigid coaxial cables from Micro-Coax.
The floating sleeves were created from hollow copper tubes (the
physical dimensions are provided in Fig. 1 and Table II). SMA
connectors were attached to the feeding ends of the semi-rigid
coaxial cables. The entire assembly was wrapped in Teflon tape
according to the topology shown in Fig. 1. The overall length of
the assembly, from the tip of the antenna to the end of the SMA
connector, is 38 cm for each antenna.
Prior to beginning the ablation experiments, we measured the
dielectric properties of the livers at the room temperature over
the frequency range of 500 MHz to 20 GHz using an Agilent vector network analyzer (E8364A) and an Agilent dielectric probe
kit (85070E). In all cases, the dielectric properties were found to
be similar to those used in our simulations, with the maximum
difference less than 15%. We also measured the input VSWR
of each antenna at different insertion depths into the liver using
a vector network analyzer (Agilent E5071C). In all cases, the
responses of the antennas at their desired frequency of operation did not change when the insertion depth was changed. This
indicates that the floating sleeve baluns used in these antennas

effectively suppress the currents excited on the outer surfaces of
the outer conductors of the feeding coaxial cables. Moreover, we
found the input VSWR to be consistently lower than 1.6, indicating a good impedance match in all cases. Immediately after each
ablation experiment, we also measured the VSWR to determine
whether the impedance match degraded due to ablation-induced
changes in tissue dielectric properties. Fig. 5 shows the comparison between pre and postablation VSWRs. While we do
observe slight degradation, the postablation VSWRs were consistently below 1.8 in all cases. This demonstrates that a good
impedance match was maintained for every antenna throughout
the ablation process, despite significant changes in the dielectric
properties of the tissue.
A total of 16 high-power ablation experiments were conducted in ex vivo bovine livers—four for each unique pairing of
frequency (1.9 or 10.0 GHz) and ablation duration (5 or 10 min).
In all cases, the antennas were inserted at a depth of 13 cm into
the bovine liver. For the 1.9-GHz experiments, a signal generator
(HP 8350B Sweep Oscillator) connected to a high-power solid
state amplifier (DMS 7066) was used as the source. The output
of the power amplifier was connected to the input of the FSD antenna using a flexible coaxial cable. The input power level of the
power amplifier was adjusted to achieve an output power level
of 42 W (at the input of the semi-rigid coaxial cable). For the
10.0-GHz experiments, the same signal generator connected to a
high-power traveling wave tube (TWT) amplifier (IFI T186-40)
was used as the source. The output of the TWT amplifier was
connected to the input of the antenna using a flexible coaxial
cable. Similar to the previous case, the input power level of the
TWT was adjusted to achieve an output power level of 42 W (at
the input of the semi-rigid coaxial cable). During each ablation,
the reflected power from the antenna was monitored and no significant changes in reflected power was detected, which agrees
with the postablation VSWR measurements of each antenna.
During the ablation process, four fiber-optic temperature
probes connected to a fluoroptic thermometer (Luxtron 3100)
were placed in the vicinity of the antennas to monitor the

temperature changes in the liver. The locations of the probes
and their relative positions with respect to the two antennas are
shown in Fig. 6(a) and 6(b). Channels 1, 2, and 3 are placed
along the radial direction at distances of 5, 10, and 15 mm from
the antenna (similar to [25]). They are placed at the z coordinate
(referring to Figs. 2, 3, and 4) that corresponds to the largest
short-axis diameters (measured on the y-axis) of both the SAR
contours and the 60◦ C contours of each antenna. Channel 4 is
placed at a distance of 10 mm beyond the tip of the dipole.
A 3-D-printed plastic guide was placed on top of the liver to
hold the probes precisely at the desired positions. The plastic
guide consists of an array of holes through which the temperature probes are routed, and parallel ridges to provide vertical
support to the temperature probes as shown in Fig. 6(c). Each
hole has a diameter of 1.8 mm to allow an 18-gauge needle to
pass through. The needles were used to guide the temperature
probes to the desired insertion depth from the top of the livers.
Once each of the probes was guided to the desired location, the
needle was removed from the hole leaving only the temperature
probe inside the liver.
Fig. 7 shows representative temperature measurements for the
5- and 10-min-ablation experiments at each frequency. Whenever a probe recorded a temperature level above 120 ◦ C (the
maximum rated temperature for the probes), that probe was removed from the liver to protect it from being damaged. This
was the case for Channel 1 temperature probes in all 10-GHz
ablation experiments conducted [see Fig. 7(a) and 7(c)]. A comparison of Channel 1 curves in Fig. 7(a) and 7(b) [or, similarly, in

Fig. 7(c) and 7(d)] shows that the area immediately surrounding
the antenna heats up much more rapidly for the 10-GHz system
than the 1.9-GHz system. Furthermore, in most of the 10-GHz
ablation experiments, the temperature readings of the more distant temperature probes (Channels 2, 3, and 4) remained flat for
approximately the first 15–20 s and then rapidly increased [e.g.,
compare Channels 2–4 of Fig. 7(a) and 7(b)]. This is in contrast to the results we obtained for the 1.9-GHz system where in
every experiment we conducted, all probes registered a rise in
temperature as soon as the power was turned on. This observed
delay in heating at locations away from the 10-GHz antenna
suggests that ablation at 10 GHz is caused by intense localized
heating in conjunction with indirect heating of the regions away
from the central heating zone. This is further supported by noting that the locations of the Channel 2, 3, and 4 probes fall
outside of the −25 dB contour lines of the SAR pattern of the
10-GHz antenna [see Fig. 2(a)]. This indicates that the amount
of EM energy deposited in these areas is not significant and
hence, heating at these locations is not direct. Possible mechanisms for this indirect heating include thermal diffusion and
the movement of the generated water vapor from the intensely
heated region to the surrounding areas. Since our simulations do
not include the thermal effects of the generation and movement
of steam and these simulations do predict similar behaviors as
the ones shown in Fig. 7, we believe that the primary cause of
this indirect heating is thermal diffusion effects.
It is also important to note a few exceptions to these general
trends that were observed during our ablation experiments. For
example, in Fig. 7(c), that shows the temperature levels for one
of the 10-min ablation experiments conducted at 10 GHz, the
temperature levels registered by Ch. 4 start to rise very rapidly
and do not show the aforementioned 15–20 s delay which can
be observed in Ch. 2–3 temperature levels. We explain this by
pointing out that the liver is not a homogeneous environment
(e.g., small veins are present at many locations within the liver).
Specifically, in the case shown in Fig. 7(c), the locations of
Ch. 1 and 4 sensors were near a small vein which connected
them together. This vein acts as a conduit to transfer heat from
the areas nearby the center of the antenna to locations close
to Ch. 4 and explains why the temperature levels registered by
Ch. 4 rise almost as fast as those registered by Ch. 1. Nonetheless, in the majority of the experiments, the temperature levels
recorded by Ch. 2–4 showed the aforementioned delay that justifies our hypothesis that ablation in these locations is caused
by heat diffusion. Irrespective of the heating mechanism (direct heating with EM waves or thermal diffusion), however, the
temperature levels at all four locations reach the ablation threshold level (60◦ C) faster in the 10-GHz ablation system than that
in the 1.9 GHz one. Finally, comparison of Fig. 7(a) and 7(c)
with Fig. 7(b) and 7(d) shows that the 10-GHz ablation system
provides significant heating in the areas beyond the tip of the
antenna whereas the 1.9-GHz ablation system does not (e.g., see
Ch. 4 curves in all of these figures).
Aside from these exceptions, the results and the trends observed in these measurements were found to be repeatable
across experiments. This is demonstrated in Fig. 8. Fig. 8(a) and
8(b) show the average temperature values recorded at the four

different observation locations for the 10- and 1.9-GHz ablation
experiments, respectively. These results include data obtained
from both the 5- and 10-min ablation experiments. Therefore,
the observation time for the average data is limited to 5 min. The
bars show the standard deviations. The relatively large standard
deviations are primarily attributed to the small total number of
ablation experiments used to generate these results. Nonetheless,
the same trends demonstrated in Fig. 7 and discussed earlier in
this section are observable in these figures.
At the conclusion of each ablation experiment, the liver was
cut along a plane through the insertion path of the antenna and
the ablation zone was visually examined. The measured dimensions of each ablation zone, given by the maximum long- and
short-axis diameters of the boundaries of the congestion zone,
are reported in Table IV and Table V. The photographs of the
ablation zones corresponding to the four experiments whose
temperature measurements are shown in Fig. 7 are shown in
Fig. 9. Fig. 9(a) and 9(b) show the ablation zones obtained after
5 min of ablation at 10.0 and 1.9 GHz, respectively. Fig. 9(c)
and 9(d) show the ablation zones obtained after 10 min of ablation at 10.0 and 1.9 GHz, respectively. The results show that
the dimensions of the ablation zones obtained at 10.0 GHz
are comparable to those obtained at 1.9 GHz. Additionally, the

photographs shown in Fig. 9 show that the ablation zones in the
10-GHz ablation experiments extend farther beyond the tips of
the antennas, as confirmed by the temperature measurements of
Ch. 4 in Fig. 7. Moreover, the size of the charred region in the
vicinity of the 10-GHz antennas is slightly larger than that of

the 1.9-GHz antenna. This agrees with the higher temperatures
measured at Ch. 1 in the 10-GHz experiments in Fig. 7.
IV. CONCLUSION
Our numerical and experimental studies presented in this paper demonstrate the feasibility of using higher frequency microwaves for tissue ablation. In particular, we demonstrated
that, despite an increase in frequency by a factor of five, the
sizes of the ablation zones obtained in 10-GHz MWA experiments are comparable to those achieved at 1.9 GHz conducted
at the same power level and for the same duration. This is
contrary to the widely accepted argument that lower frequency
microwaves provide larger ablation sizes due to higher penetration depths of electromagnetic waves into the body and the lower
losses in biological tissues at such frequencies. Our experiments
show that, as far as ablation size is concerned, MWA using a
relatively low frequency of 1.9 GHz does not have any significant advantages over MWA using a relatively high frequency
of 10.0 GHz. However, higher frequency microwaves offer the
advantage of smaller antenna lengths. Additionally, new antenna topologies are currently under investigation that allow for
eliminating coaxial baluns in high-frequency, coaxial-cable-fed
MWA antennas thereby reducing the antenna diameter in addition to the antenna length. Therefore, MWA may potentially be
performed using less invasive antennas at higher frequencies.
Furthermore, using higher microwave frequencies, it may be
possible to develop compact multielement arrays that are capable of generating heating zones not achievable from large
single-element antennas used in conventional low-frequency
MWA. Finally, in situations where a small ablation zone may
be needed, using higher frequencies allows for the desired ablation size to be created in a shorter period of time. Due to
these possible advantages, further investigation into using highfrequency microwaves for ablation experiments and studying
new antenna designs and antenna arrays that take advantage of
the unique properties offered at such high frequencies is indeed
warranted.
