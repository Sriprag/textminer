Abstract—Goal: The aim of this study was to investigate the normalization of the intrinsic functional activity and connectivity of TS
adolescents before and after the cranial electrotherapy stimulation
(CES) with alpha stim device. Methods: We performed restingstate functional magnetic resonance imaging on eight adolescents
before and after CES with mean age of about nine-years old who
had Tourette’s syndrome with moderate to severe tics symptom.
Independent component analysis (ICA) with hierarchical partner
matching method was used to examine the functional connectivity between regions within cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC)
circuit. Granger causality was used to investigate effective connectivity among these regions detected by ICA. We then performed
pattern classification on independent components with significant
group differences that served as endophenotype markers to distinguish the adolescents between TS and the normalized ones after
CES. Results: Results showed that TS adolescents after CES treatment had stronger functional activity and connectivity in anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC), caudate and posterior cingulate cortex
while had weaker activity in supplementary motor area within the
motor pathway compared with TS before CES. Conclusion: The
results suggest that the functional activity and connectivity in motor pathway was suppressed while activities in the control portions
within CSTC loop including ACC and caudate were increased in
TS adolescents after CES compared with adolescents before CES.
Significance: The normalization of the balance between motor and
control portions of the CSTC circuit may result in the recovery of
TS adolescents.

and uncontrollable vocal tics. These symptoms typically appear before the age of 18 and the condition occurs in all ethnic
groups with males affected three to four times more often than
females [1]. The cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit
has been verified as an underlying neurobiological correlate of
TS [2], [3]. High-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging has shown that children and adult TS subjects displayed
extensive brain abnormalities, including cortical thickness [4],
[5] and changes in gray or white matter volumes in brain regions involved in prefrontal, sensorimotor, cingulate cortices
and basal ganglia within CSTC circuit [6], [7]. Diffusion tensor
imaging demonstrated that TS patients had decreased fractional
anisotropy and increased radial diffusivity in the corticospinal
tract, the corpus callosum, and long association fibre tracts compared with normal controls [8], [9]. In another study, the diffusion indices and tic severity of TS was reported to have a positive
correlation in the amygdale, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, and putamen [10]. Functional neuroimaging studies have
revealed brain activation and connection alterations in TS subjects during a variety of tics and nontics tasks [11], [12], including an increased functional interaction between primary motor
cortex and supplementary motor cortex (SMA) during tics than
intentional movements [13], different neuronal networks and
connectivity patterns when performing increasingly demanding
finger-tapping tasks [14], reduced activity in precentral gyrus,
caudate and increased activity in medial frontal gyrus during
finger-tapping task [15], frontal cortex and striatum during eye
blinking inhabitation [16], altered connectivity of the ventral
striatum in TS individuals with analyzing the functional coupling based on positron emission tomography [17]. Moreover,
our previous study has investigated spontaneous and simulated
tics in TS individuals with revealing that tics were caused by
the combined effects of excessive activity in motor pathway
and reduced activation in control portions of CSTC circuit [18],
[19].
However, most studies have mainly examined task-specific
neural anomalies in TS. It is likely that the core neural causes
of TS are task independent. Several previous studies have also
investigated resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in TS subjects. One previous study computed
the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) of rs-fMRI data and found decreased
ALFF/fALFF in posterior cingulate gyrus, anterior cingulated
cortex, frontal cortex, and increased ALFF/fALFF in putamen
and thalamus [20]. Another study investigated the functional

connectivity of the fronto-parietal control network and the
cingulo-opercular control network with the predefined 39 regions of interest (ROIs) [21]. In addition, the temporal pattern
of tic generation was demonstrated to follow the CSTC circuit
by investigating tic-related activity and the underlying resting
state networks [22]. But the functional connectivity and causality of the intrinsic CSTC neural circuits are still not examined.
We present the first study, as far as we know, to apply the
independent component analysis (ICA) with hierarchical partner matching (HPM) algorithm following by granger causality
analytical approaches used by Wang et al. [18], [23] to rs-fMRI
data which were collected in patients with TS before and after cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) treatment to insight
into the mechanism underlying this intervention strategy.
CES is a noninvasive therapeutic device that applies pulsed,
alternating microcurrent (<1000 μA) transcutaneously to the
head via electrodes placed on the earlobes, mastoid processes,
zygomatic arches, or the maxillo-occipital junction. CES has
been granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since 1979 for the treatment of insomnia, depression, and
anxiety, and it is commercially available for personal use. Compared with other established noninvasive stimulation techniques,
such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct
current stimulation, CES is relatively inexpensive, and it can be
self-administered by patients with few side effects [24]. In the
clinical applications of CES, it is recommended that patients can
be prescribed a CES device to use at home with a regular 20to 60-min treatment daily or every other day for the treatment
of anxiety, depression, pain or insomnia [25]–[27]. CES effects are cumulative so those who do not respond initially may
benefit when given daily treatments for one month or longer
[28]. Previous neuroimaging studies have claimed that CES has
beneficial effects in conditions such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, stress, and pain [26], [29]. A recent functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) study tested 0.5- and 100-Hz stimulation on healthy controls, using blocks of 22 s “on” alternating
with 22 s of baseline (device was “off”), suggesting that CES
caused cortical brain deactivation in prefrontal and parietal regions [30]. Electroencephalographic studies showed that CES
increased alpha activity (increased relaxation), decreased delta
activity (reduced fatigue), and decreased beta activity (decreased
ruminative thoughts) [26], [31]. In addition, CES has been found
to induce changes in brain oscillation patterns, neurotransmitter, neurohormones and endorphin release, interruption of ongoing cortical activity, or secondary effects from peripheral nerve
stimulation [32]. However, it remains unclear how the electrical
current from CES may alter intrinsic brain activity and connectivity in clinical populations. In this study, we found that CES
was effective in treating TS. We applied CES to the earlobes
of TS patients. In this way, the current may initially stimulate
afferent branches of cranial nerves. Then stimulation may be
carried from branches of the facial, glossopharyngeal, and/or
the vagus nerves to the brainstem, the thalamus, and finally the
cortex [30]. We, therefore, hypothesized that CES could alter
intrinsic brain activity and connectivity, which in turn improves
the neuro dysfunction and leads to the normalization of intrinsic
neural circuits governing TS.

ICA has been widely utilized for analyzing brain imaging
data. ICA is intrinsically a multivariate method for blind separation of a composite signal into its constituent source signals.
As a data-driven approach, ICA can be used to identify brain
networks in resting-state fMRI besides task-related fMRI since
it does not require a priori information about the source signals. Each independent component (IC) provides a grouping of
brain regions that share the same response pattern, thus, providing a natural measure of functional connectivity. There has
been several kinds of multisubject ICA analysis approaches (for
a review, see [33]). We focus on the individual ICA approach
that separates ICA analyses run on each subjects, followed by
clustering to enable group since this approach can preserve the
individuals unique spatial and temporal features.
In the present study, we examined blood oxygenation level
dependent (BOLD) fluctuations and intrinsic brain functional
connectivity based on resting-state functional MRI data. We
applied ICA with HPM algorithm to identify ICs that were reproducible across individuals. We also calculated the granger
causality index (GCI) [34], [35] as a measure of causal interactions among components of CSTC circuit that generate or control motor behaviors. We finally performed machine learning
and pattern classification on ICs with significant group differences that can serve as endophenotype markers to distinguish
the adolescents between TS before CES and normalized TS after
CES.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. CES Therapy
We used the CES device, called the alpha-stim stress control system in the clinical treatment, provided by the manufacturer, Electromedical Products International (Mineral Wells,
Tex). The alpha-stim stress control system provides cranial electrical stimulation by generating bipolar, asymmetric rectangular
waves with a frequency of 0.5 Hz and a current intensity that can
be adjusted continuously to provide between 10 and 500 μA. At
the beginning of the treatment, patient’s earlobes were clipped
by the electrodes, and the current was adjusted until the patient
felt a mild tingling sensation and/or dizziness, at which point the
current was reduced to just below the reported threshold of sensation. If the patient experienced no sensation, the investigator
increased the current incrementally until the patient perceived
a sensation and then reduced it slightly below that threshold.
Once the current intensity was found, the patient was instructed
to use it consistently throughout the duration of the 24 weeks of
treatment.
The protocol of treatment was that patients took stimulation
once a day with their parents’ help at his or her place of residence
when got in bed. The treatment duration was set to be 60 min
each time. Patients could fall asleep during treatment.
B. Participants
We recruited 43 male or female right-handed patients (less
than 12 years old) with a diagnosis of TS (according DSM-IV)
in the study. All the patients were physical healthy and the IQ

1274

examination were no less than 100. The patients were drug free
for at least one month before recruited. The exclusion criteria
include co-occurring anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, current depression, current or previous history of
psychosis.
Forty-two patients were completed 24-week treatment and
one patient was dropped out one week after CES treatment
for lack of efficacy. All the patients were encouraged to take
fMRI scan before treatment and at the end of the treatment, but
only eight patients completed both the treatment and scan since
the fMRI scanning was optional for the patients. The safety
screening form and informed consent form were approved by
the Institutional Review Board of Wuhan University People
Hospital. Parental consent was obtained from participants under
age 18. The efficacy of CES was evaluated by Yale Global
Tic Severity Scale (Y-GTSS), and the side effect was recorded
according to patients’ report.
C. Imaging Data Acquisition
Resting-state fMRI was performed on a 3T magnetic resonance unit (GE Signa Medical Systems, Twinspeed, Milwaukee) in the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. A birdcage
head coil and restraining foam pads were used to minimize head
motion. Functional data were acquired using a gradient-echo,
T2∗ -weighted echo-planar imaging with BOLD contrast pulse
sequence. Thirty-two contiguous axial slices that covered the
entire hemisphere and brainstem were acquired along the AC–
PC plane, with a 64 × 64 matrix (repetition time = 2000 msec,
echo time = 30 msec, field of view = 24 cm × 24 cm, and slice
thickness = 4 mm without a gap).
D. Data Analysis
1) Preprocessing: We preprocessed the fMRI data using the
statistical parametric mapping software package SPM8 (Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, United
Kingdom; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) implemented in
MATLAB 2012B. During the preprocessing procedures, the
volumes were slice timing corrected, spatially realigned to correct for motion, normalized to Montreal Neurological Institutecoordinate system [36], resampled at 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm,
and spatially smoothed with an isotropic 8-mm full-width at
half-maximum Gaussian kernel to remove spatial noise, and to
compensate for residual variability in functional anatomy after
spatial normalization and to facilitate application of Gaussian
random field theory for adjusted statistical inference. The spatially smoothed functional data were high-pass filtered via a
discrete cosine transform at a cutoff frequency of 1/128 Hz to
remove low-frequency noise such as scanner drift.
2) ICA with HPM: First, we performed single-subject ICA
for each subject after preprocessing. We used the principles of
information criteria to determine the number of sets of ICs,
N. We combined minimum description length [37], [38] and
Akaike’s information criterion [39] to estimate the lower and
upper bounds, respectively, of the numbers of ICs to generate
for each participant. Thus, these lower and upper bounds defined an interval for the number N of components to generate.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 5, MAY 2015

For the TS datasets in this study, the interval was [20:130]. Unlike conventional ICA, in which only one set of ICs is generated
(we term this “single-set ICA,” or SS-ICA), we generated multiple sets of components for each participant, which we term
“multiple-set ICA”. For each participant, with an increment of
ten over the interval [20:130], we used the FastICA algorithm to
generate 12 sets of ICs, with each of the 12 sets containing either
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, or 130 components,
respectively.
The fMRI data were decomposed to spatial ICs and mixing
matrix by applying spatial ICA on each subject after and before
CES. ICs represent brain functional activity and connectivity.
The corresponding column of each IC is time course, which
represents the time variety of brain function network.
Second, we applied HPM algorithm to identify the reliable
components that are significantly reproducible among different
subject. We define a family of ICs as referring to the set of all ICs
for a single scanning run. In this study, we had data from eight
participants in the TS group before and after CES treatment,
yielding a total of 8 + 8 = 16 different families. For each of the
16 families, we generated 12 sets of ICs, with each of the 12 sets
containing either 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120,
or 130 components, as described earlier. In addition, we have
demonstrated previously that assessing whether a matching is
bidirectional is a useful and valid way to test whether an IC
is reproducible between families [23], which terms the Partner
Matching algorithm. In detail, given a component i from family
A, we calculate indices of spatial similarity between IC i from
family A and each IC in family B. We use Tanimoto Distance
to quantify this spatial similarity between components [23]. We
then select the component from family B, say component j,
that is determined to have the maximum similarity index to
component i among all the components of family B. After that,
we calculate all the similarity indices between component j
from family B and each of the components in family A. We then
select the component from family A, say component k, that is
determined to have the maximum similarity index to component
j among all the components of family A. If k = i, then the
matching is bidirectional, and we consider this component in
family A and this component in family B to be partner matched.
We repeat this procedure to find all pairs of components that
are bidirectionally matched between families A and B. Then,
we apply this algorithm to identify matching components across
multiple families. We call a collection of components that match
across families a cluster. For example, a cluster may contain
component i of family A, component j of family B, component
m of family C, etc., all of which are matched to one another
according to the partner matching procedure described earlier.
Therefore, each of these clusters contains the information of
component correspondences between families.
There are two steps in the HPM algorithm. In the first step,
we used Tanimoto distance to quantify the spatial similarity between components and only bidirectional matching ICs were
identified as matching components cross multiple subjects.
These components that were identified as being significantly
similar to one another in their spatial configuration formed a
cluster. We then performed one-sample t test on the z score

maps of ICs within each cluster to obtain the map of significant
voxels for that cluster. The cluster map represented a spatial pattern that tends to be present across subjects. In the second step,
we applied partner matching to the cluster maps to identify corresponding clusters across the different sets. The clusters with
the highest Cronbach’s Alpha were selected as optimal clusters.
Each cluster means a pattern that has one or more brain regions.
The cluster of artifactual ICs were identified visually and only
the meaningful clusters be used for the following analysis. We
finally computed the GCI to assess causal influence between
these brain regions by extracting the time course of each IC
within each pattern.
3) Group Differences Between Before and After CES Treatment: The z score maps of reproducible ICs were entered into
group-level random-effect analysis. For each cluster, we entered
z score maps of ICs into the second-level paired t test model implemented in SPM8 factorial module to detect a random effect of
the group difference of the functional connectivity between the
TS adolescents after and before CES. The second-level analysis
identified significant group differences in ROIs within CSTC
circuit. These regions were selected for the pattern recognition
analyses.
4) Machine Learning: By extracting the eigenvectors from
each subject’s individual z score maps of ICs, the time series
of within each of the ROIs that had significant group differences were defined as the features vectors. We performed pattern recognition using two methods: support vector machine
(SVM) and the maximum uncertainty linear discriminant analysis (MLDA) [40] with cross validation to classify the TS patients
before and after CES and cross verify the detected normalized
functional activity and connectivity results. The support vector
optimization problem can be solved analytically only when the
number of training data is very small [41]. The MLDA method
was also suitable in the situation of small samples [40]. In addition, fivefold cross validation and leave-one-out cross validation method were used to quantify the performance of SVM
classifier. The classification accuracy was calculated by averaging 1000 cross validation trials with randomly selected subsets.
Therefore, the sample size in this study is not large but remains
acceptable for binary classification. Importantly, the accurate

ten clusters of independent components. Any two group activity maps within

one another in their spatial configurations. ACC = anterior cingulate cortex;

classification was able to cross verify the features that detected
by ICA and identify the difference of the TS patients between
before and after the CES.
III. RESULTS
A. Clinical Results
The mean age of the 42 patients that have completed the
treatment was 95.90 ± 23.48 months. The duration of TS was
21.12 ± 9.11 months. The score of Y-GTSS was 26.33 ± 1.32
before CES. The total score of Y-GTSS was 11.36 ± 6.44 after 24-week treatment of CES. We applied two-sample t test
to assess the group difference in Y-GTSS scores of patients

1276

between before and after CES. The 42 patients after CES had
significantly lower Y-GTSS scores than the ones before CES
(p = 8.14e − 25, t = −14.77, after CES versus before CES).
The mean age of the eight patients that have completed
fMRI scan was 105.88 ± 23.76 months. The duration of TS was
22.50 ± 4.24 months. The score of Y-GTSS was 26.38 ± 1.19
before CES. The total score of Y-GTSS was 10.50 ± 5.88 after
24-week treatment of CES. The eight patients after CES had
significantly lower Y-GTSS scores than the ones before CES
(p = 2.94e − 06, t = −7.49, after CES versus before CES).
All the eight patients with fMRI were responsive to treatment
and three of the 42 patients after CES had the same Y-GTSS
scores as the ones before CES. There was no patient that had
increased Y-GTSS scores after CES among all 42 patients (see
Fig. 1).
We compared the eight patients that had completed MRI scan
and the total 42 patients that had completed the trial. There was
no statistical significant difference in age, duration of TS, and
score of TS between them. There were four headaches and two
insomnia reports. All the events were released without special
treatment during the trial.
B. Reproducible ICs
We performed spatial ICA to generate twelve sets of ICs, with
each of the twelve sets containing either 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70,
80, 90, 100, 110, 120, or 130 components, for each TS patient
after and before CES. We then applied HPM method to the
12 sets of components to identify ten significantly reproducible
clusters of ICs in their spatial patterns across patients. Onesample t test was performed on the ten clusters of ICs for after
and before CES groups, respectively, to generate ten ICs maps,
which represent brain functional activity and connectivity (see
Fig. 2).
C. Group Difference in Resting-State Functional Connectivity
Patterns Before and After CES
The ten reproducible ICs of before and after TS subjects
were compared in a second-level random-effects analysis by using paired two tailed t test. Compared with TS patients before
CES, TS patients after CES showed significantly lower intrinsic functional connectivity in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
caudate and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Meanwhile, TS
patients after CES showed significantly greater intrinsic functional connectivity in the SMA, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
primary somatosensory cortex (PSC) (see Fig. 3 and Table I).
We used a combination of p value of 0.01 and cluster extent
threshold of 30 voxels (determined by Monte Carlo simulation)
to correct for multiple comparison. We computed the correlations between the activity of the six regions and the score
difference of Y-GTSS (Y-GTSS of after CES minus Y-GTSS
of before CES). Activity in SMA, PFC, and PSC correlated
positively with the difference of Y-GTSS score, while activity
in ACC, caudate, and PCC correlated inversely with the score
difference. Only neural activity in SMA correlated significantly
with the score difference (r = 0.71, p < 0.05).

Fig. 3. Normalization of brain activity with CES treatment (TS patients after
CES versus TS patients before CES). The two sets of three columns display t
contrast maps comparing the group activity maps from the Tourette’s syndrome
patients after CES and before CES. The images show that relative to Tourette’s
syndrome patients before CES, Tourette’s syndrome patients after CES had
weaker activity (as evidenced by the color blue, the first sets of three columns)
in the SMA, PFC, PSC, while had stronger activity (as evidenced by the color
red, the second sets of three columns) in the ACC, caudate, and PCC.

D. Granger Causality Interactions
We computed two types of granger causality indices between
the time courses of the selected reproducible ten ICs for each
participant. One is influence of regions A on B, the other is influence of regions A on B through thalamus. That is because the
top-down circuit from cortex to basal ganglia is direct, while the
bottom-up circuit from basal ganglia to cortex via the thalamus.
The TS patients after CES group showed stronger causal influences compared with before CES group in the connections from
PFC to caudate (0.19 ± 0.06 versus 0.09 ± 0.06, t = 3.60, p =
0.0029), from PFC to ACC (0.15 ± 0.09 versus 0.04 ± 0.03,
t = 3.38, p = 0.0045), from the caudate to PFC via the thalamus
(0.16 ± 0.14 versus 0.05 ± 0.04, t = 2.23, p = 0.0428), while
the TS patients after CES group showed weaker causal influences in the connections from SMA to PMC (0.07 ± 0.05 versus
0.13 ± 0.06, t = −2.16, p = 0.0484), from pallidum to SMA
via the thalamus (0.04 ± 0.02 versus 0.17 ± 0.15, t = −2.27,
p = 0.0393) (see Table II).
E. Machine Learning Results
Using the activity within the ACC, caudate, PCC, SMA, PFC,
and PSC resulted from group difference in functional connectivity patterns before and after CES, we performed a machine
learning algorithm based on SVM to classify the TS patients
before and after CES treatment, yielding an average accuracy
of 84.28% with five-fold cross validation method and 87.60%
with leave-one-out cross validation method. Additionally, we
also performed classification using the MLDA-based classifier
with leave-one-out cross validation, which achieved a classification accuracy of 87.50% with a sensitivity of 86.23% and a
specificity of 91.47%. The classification contributions as shown
in Table I were obtained by the coefficients of the discrimination hyperplane that measures the weights of these features to
the classification.

The data in each cell in the second and third column represent the mean±std of the GCI. We used two-sample t test to compare the GCIs of TS between after
and before CES groups. The bold in the last column indicates that the comparisons are significant (p < 0.05, uncorrected). X → Y via Thalamus represents the
connectivity between X and Y via the thalamus.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In the present study, we applied HPM-ICA, granger causality
as well as pattern recognition methods based on rs-fMRI data
to investigate and cross verify the normalization in intrinsic
brain functional activity and connectivity between TS patients
before and after CES therapy. We found that TS patients after
CES exhibited altered spontaneous functional connectivity in
brain areas within CSTC circuit involved in motor generation or
control, including SMA, caudate, PFC, ACC, and default mode
network (DMN), primary in PCC. The functional activity and
connectivity in motor pathway was suppressed, while activations in the control portions of CSTC loop were increased in the
TS patients after CES compared with ones before CES. The normalization of the balance between motor and control portions
of the CSTC circuit may result in the recovery of TS patients.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the HPM-ICA
and granger causality analytical approaches to rs-fMRI data
with TS patients before and after CES treatment. From the perspective of neurophysiology, we concluded that the intervention
of CES was able to improve the brain neuro dysfunction and
had the obvious promotion effect on TS for their brain function improvement, which translates the changes of the intrinsic
connectivity networks to therapeutic mechanisms of action and

provides an objective experimental basis for its application in
TS.
We found significantly greater activity in ACC and caudate
in the TS patients after CES than before CES. This finding is
consistent with our previous reports of functional anomalies or
disconnections in this region in TS patients [18]. One DTI study
demonstrated that cortical regions as well as limbic structures
take part in the modulation of tics [9]. Other studies have also
shown decreased fALFF in ACC in TS adolescents based on
rs-fMRI [20], increased activity in ACC during tic suppression
[11], reduced caudate volume both in TS adults and adolescents
[42], [43]. ACC plays an important role in the engagement of
cognitive control [44], [45] that together with caudate represent
the control portions of the CSTC circuit. Tics are caused by
the combined effects of excessive activity in motor pathway
and reduced activity in control portions of CSTC circuits [18].
Therefore, increased pathological intrinsic functional activity
and connectivity in ACC and caudate represented the normalized
engagement of control portions of CSTC circuit.
The TS patients that after CES group had weaker intrinsic
neural activity than ones that before CES group within the supplementary motor area (SMA). In patients with TS disease, it
has been shown that brain regions in the motor pathway of
CSTC circuit, including SMA, premotor area, primary motor

1278

area, putamen, pallidum and substantia nigra, exhibited excessive activity compared with normal controls [18]. Another fMRI
study reported that activation and functional connectivity of
motor network including frontal, parietal, and subcortical areas
were altered in adult TS patients as compared to controls during performance of tasks such as finger tapping [14]. We did
not detect significant differences in basal ganglia and thalamus
by comparing the reliable ICs of TS patients before and after
CES groups. This result is consistent with previous DTI reports,
which only reported the correlation between diffusion parameters and measures of tic severity within the TS group but did
not find significant differences in the diffusion indices of basal
ganglia and the thalamus between TS patients and controls [10].
However, we did find that causal influence of the putamen on
SMA via thalamus was weaker in the TS patients after CES than
ones before CES. Previous researches demonstrate that SMA is
responsible to trigger motor response or anticipate that a movement is going to occur [46], [47]. Moreover, SMA has been
shown to play an importance role in tics generation no matter in
resting state or task-related fMRI TS studies [13], [22]. Abnormal activation of motor cortex via basal ganglia thalamocortical
circuits would cause relatively simple tics. Abnormal activation
of SMA as well as premotor and cingulate motor areas would
cause complex tics [48]. Therefore, the weaker activity in SMA
and GCI from the putamen to SMA via thalamus suggests the
normalization of the motor pathway in CSTC circuit.
We detected the DMN in the reproducible ICs and then compared the intrinsic functional activity between TS patients after
and before CES. We found increased functional activity in PCC
in TS patients after CES than ones before CES. The DMN that
mainly includes the PCC, medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral inferior parietal lobes, and the medial temporal lobe is typically
deactivate during cognitive tasks [49]. Particularly, PCC plays
a pivotal role in the DMN [50] which has also been strongly
implicated as a key part of several intrinsic cognitive control
networks [51]. Some previous studies revealed the decreased
ALFF in PCC in TS adolescents [20] based on rs-fMRI, attenuated deactivations with age in PCC in TS adults during a
stroop task [52]. The abnormal pattern of deactivation or lowfrequency fluctuation may reflect the inability to maintain efficient control of the PCC/DMN function [53]. Therefore, our
finding of increased functional activity and connectivity in PCC
suggests the normalization of functional deficits associated with
impaired motor inhibition.
Computer modeling predictions using a highly detailed
anatomical model has shown that CES induced significant currents in cortical and subcortical structures [54]. Moreover, CES
stimulation has been investigated to alter cortical activation and
brain connectivity in the DMN [30]. Convergent evidence has
shown that CES caused the alpha band mean or median frequency to shift downward [55], [56]. Meanwhile, the alpha
band conveyed information about the BOLD signal [57]. Therefore, the observation of altered BOLD signal was associated
with CES therapy. In this way, CES may alter brain oscillation
patterns since the oscillating current from CES may interrupt
nervous system function, resulting in deactivation of cortical
activity [30]. The normalization of TS patients after CES may

due to the changes in brain activity and intrinsic connectivity
networks in line with evidence that stimulation interferes with
oscillatory brain activity and is associated with reduction of
brain wave frequencies (mean alpha power) [30].
Furthermore, SVM and MLDA were used to create classifier models that distinguished TS patients before CES from TS
patients after CES treatment, which attained 87.6% and 87.5%
classification accuracy with leave-one-out cross validation, respectively. The high classification accuracy suggested that the
intrinsic functional connectivity in brain regions within CSTC
circuit could truly differentiate the two groups and cross verify the detected normalized connectivity, which can be used
as endophenotype to classify the TS patients before and after
CES.
Several limitations of the present study should be noted. First,
the sample size in this study was not large. However, we calculated the classification accuracy by averaging 1,000 cross validation trials with randomly selected subsets, which cross verify
the findings of the normalized functional connectivity. The future work should be done on a larger training sample, which
may lead to higher classification accuracy. Second, considering
no risk to try CES treatment, the patients who had tried all the
other treatments with no effective outcome voluntarily participated in the test with a sole purpose to reduce their tic symptoms
and, thus, were very eager to see the effective outcome of new
treatment using CES. Therefore, this was a clinical sample and
there was not a “sham” stimulation group in this study. We
compared the group difference between patients before and after CES and achieved high-classification accuracy, suggesting
that the findings from patients before and after CES provide
important insights into the neuroscience of TS normalization
after CES, similar studies consisting of an active CES group, a
control group and a “sham” treatment group are needed to do
further more relevant analysis including the group comparison
and classification analysis. Third, different TS individuals may
have different responses to the scanner noise of fMRI which
may lead to change of brain function. It will be necessary to
replicate these results with silent techniques such as EEG. Finally, the individual ICA method has the advantage of getting
unique spatial and temporal features, but ICs are not necessary
uncompounded in the same way since the noisy maybe different
for each participant.
