Abstract
Narrative reviews of peer review research have concluded that there is negligible evidence of gender bias in the awarding of grants
based on peer review. Here, we report the findings of a meta-analysis of 21 studies providing, to the contrary, evidence of robust
gender differences in grant award procedures. Even though the estimates of the gender effect vary substantially from study to study,
the model estimation shows that all in all, among grant applicants men have statistically significant greater odds of receiving grants
than women by about 7%.

1. Introduction
Merton (1973) describes the “norm of universalism” in science whereby all scientists should be evaluated purely on
the quality of their work and thus have the same chance of success. Merton (1973) regarded meritocracy in science as
essential for the advancement of scientific knowledge. If functionally irrelevant factors skew the results when scientific
contributions are evaluated, it will take longer for nature to reveal its laws (Hull, 1990). A functionally irrelevant factor
is one that does not affect the ability of an individual to perform a particular functional role or status. For the progress
of science, a grant applicant’s gender is functionally irrelevant. If gender is used, either explicitly or implicitly, in the
evaluation of scientific work and affects the way in which grant decisions are made, the principles of universalism and
objectivity are being abridged (Cole, 1992). Potential disadvantages for women compared with men have been and
remain a major source of controversy in society, and scientists have been heavily preoccupied with the issue in the
context of the operation of the grant awards system (Wennerås & Wold, 2000).
Even if most scientific institutions have affirmative action officers and procedures designed to ensure that women
have an equal chance, a comprehensive review of the literature on gender differences in the careers of academic
scientists by the National Science Foundation (NSF, Arlington, VA, USA) comes to conclusion: “taken as a whole, the
body of literature we reviewed provides evidence that women in academic careers are disadvantaged compared with
men in similar careers. Women faculty earn less, are promoted less frequently to senior academic ranks, and publish
less frequently than their male counterparts” (National Science Foundation, 2003, p. 1). In the award of grants based on
peer review, on the other hand, the gender of the applicant appears to play a negligible part. In 2003 a literature review

of peer review research concluded: “the most frequent criticism made by scientists about the day to day operation of
peer review is that of . . . gender bias. We suggest that this criticism is generally unfounded” (Wood & Wessely, 2003, p.
36). In a Cochrane Methodology Review the research findings are summarized in similar terms: “descriptive evidence
of gender bias was provided by a study at the Swedish Medical Research Council, but a number of other studies carried
out in similar contexts found no evidence of it” (Demicheli & Pietrantonj, 2004).
Both of the above-mentioned reviews of the research on peer review finding little evidence of gender bias describe
the existing literature using the narrative technique, without attempting quantitative synthesis of study results. As from
the viewpoint of quantitative social scientists narrative reviews are not very precise in their descriptions of study results
(Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002), quantitative techniques should be used as well as narrative techniques. The term
“meta-analysis” (Glass, 1976) refers to a statistical approach that combines evidence from different studies to obtain
an overall estimate of treatment effects (Shadish et al., 2002). Taking the quantitative approach, meta-analysis allows
generalized statements on the strength of the effects, regardless of the specificity of individual studies (Matt & Navarro,
1997). Undertaking a meta-analysis presupposes that each study is similarly designed with regard to certain properties
(e.g., methods, sampling). Even though the studies that investigated the influence of the applicant’s gender on decisions
in grant peer review are quite heterogeneous in these properties, most of them are very similar in reporting the following
proportions: number of men and number of women among both approved and rejected applicants for grants. Using
these frequency data, it is possible to evaluate the empirical studies meta-analytically (Skrondal & Rabe-Hesketh,
2004).
Meta-analysis (Skrondal & Rabe-Hesketh, 2004) is recommended for a quantitative review of experimental studies
in which subjects were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. However, peer review is not a ‘medication’
that can be tested in a randomized clinical trial (Marusic, 2005). For the meta-analysis we were therefore restricted
to non-experimental studies that investigated peer review in a “natural setting.” The restriction to the “natural setting”
makes it very difficult to establish unambiguously whether work from a particular group of scientists has a higher
approval rate due to biases1 in the decision-making procedure, or if greater success in the procedure is simply a
consequence of the scientific merit of the corresponding group of applications. As with non-experimental studies it
is hardly possible to demonstrate gender bias in the decision-making process of grant peer review, our meta-analysis
addressed the following question: do the studies show an overall gender effect in the decisions in grant peer review?
2. Methods
2.1. Locating studies
The literature research was conducted at the end of 2005. In a first step we located some studies that investigated
the influence of the applicant’s gender on decisions in grant peer review, using the reference lists provided by narrative
reviews of research on grant peer review (Demicheli & Pietrantonj, 2004; Wood & Wessely, 2003) and using tables of
contents of certain journals (e.g., Nature, Research Policy, Scientometrics). We conducted a search of both publications
(journal articles, monographs, collected works, etc.) and grey literature (Internet documents, institutional reports, case
reports, etc.) to avoid a bias that follows from the difficulties of publishing nonconforming studies (Eagly, 2005;
Greenwald, 1975).
In a second step, in order to obtain keywords for searching computerized databases, we prepared a bibliogram
(White, 2005) for the studies located in the first step. The bibliogram ranks by frequency the words included in the
abstracts of the studies located. Words at the top of the ranking list (e.g., peer review, gender, sex, women, science
and bias) were used for searches in computerized literature databases (e.g., Web of Science, IngentaConnect, PubMed,
Sociological Abstracts, ProQuest Digital Dissertations, PsycINFO, ERIC) and Internet search engines (e.g., Google,
Ask Jeeves).
In the final step of our literature search, we located all of the citing publications for a series of articles (found in
the first and second step) for which there are a fairly large number of citations in Web of Science. In addition, we sent
inquiries to authors of narrative reviews on peer review research asking them to supplement our publications list with
further studies. If the data in the studies that we researched was incomplete for our purposes, we tried to contact the
1

“Bias is any feature of an evaluator’s cognitive or attitudinal mind-set that could interfere with an objective evaluation” (Shatz, 2004, p. 36).

228

authors of the studies. But it is often difficult to trace the authors of older studies, and they are often hazy even about
relatively recent work (Shadish et al., 2002).
We encountered some difficulty in finding studies, because grant peer review – although “the key institution of the
scientific culture” (Ziman, 2000, p. 246) – frequently remains a secret activity (Tight, 2003). According to Daryl Chubin,
director of the Center for Advancing Science & Engineering Capacity (American Association for the Advancement
of Science, Washington, DC), the reason peer review is seldom studied empirically is that reviews are secured with
assurance of confidentiality. To link reviewer and review information would break that confidence. Where a systematic
review of peer review is undertaken, the findings are often not published. If the findings are published, their reception
can be hampered if the relevant documents are available only in the respective native language.
2.2. Studies for the meta-analysis
We were able to include in our meta-analysis data on proportions of women and men for 66 different peer review
procedures from 21 studies. As the studies give these proportions for various funding institutions, funding programs
and different cohorts of applicants, we had data for three different procedures on average per study. Thus, one procedure
is characterized by a single set of proportions: women and men among applicants as well as women and men among
approved applicants. For example, Ackers et al. (2000) report the participation of women researchers in the TMR
Marie Curie Fellowship Programme. The authors present the proportions of women and men for seven peer review
procedures (that is, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, earth sciences, economics, physics and life sciences). Table 1
and Table 2 provide the information collected by our research team on the 66 peer review procedures from the studies.
One researcher on our team extracted this information from the publications. The information was then validated by
a second researcher on our team, and disagreements were resolved by consensus. The bibliographic data for the 21
studies can be found in Table 3.
The studies included in the meta-analysis were published between 1987 and 2005 as article (n = 10), grey literature
(n = 7), letter (n = 2), book (n = 1) or commentary (n = 1) by men scientists (n = 9), women scientists (n = 6) or by both
men and women scientists (n = 5) (the authors of one study are not known). In one study the proportion of women
and men is based on survey data; the other studies worked with archive data. The data evaluated in the studies refers
to periods between 1979 and 2004. Due to the fact that most of the studies used were published as peer reviewed
publications or as reports of renowned funding institutions their quality is sufficiently guarantied.
The data on the 66 peer review procedures in the 21 studies refer either to peer review for the assessment of research
applications (n = 40) or peer review for the assessment of applications for post-graduate fellowships (n = 26). The
studies covered 13 findings on the proportion of women and men for a research funding institution in Australia (e.g.,
Australian Research Council, Canberra); 15 findings refer to the peer review of a funding institution in North America
(e.g., NSF) and 38 that of a European institution (e.g., EMBO). Twenty-nine sets of data in the studies refer to peer
review in the life sciences field; for the exact sciences there are 11 sets and for the social sciences and humanities 13
sets of data. Twelve proportion findings concern more than 1 specialist discipline (in 1 study there is no classification
of discipline).
2.3. Statistical methods
For the calculation of the meta-analysis we considered as dependent variable estimations of the odds ratio, the odds
for being approved among women applicants divided by the odds of being approved among men applicants. For an
individual peer review procedure j (e.g., at the NSF) that we included in the meta-analysis, this odds ratio can be
estimated as
d1j /(n1j − d1j )
oj =
,
(1)
d0j /(n0j − d0j )
where d1j and n1j are the number of women among approved and all applicants, respectively, whereas d0j and n0j are
the number of men among approved and all applicants, respectively.
The approach of our meta-analysis is to analyze the estimated gender effect at the level of different peer review
procedures that were investigated in the different studies. As we assume that the true gender effect varies between peer
review procedures and between studies, we used for the meta-analysis generalized linear mixed models that explicitly

allow for these variations in a multilevel framework. As the estimates of effect sizes violate the normality assumption,
we analyzed log odds ratios instead of odds ratios (Skrondal & Rabe-Hesketh, 2004).
In our data there is a three-level structure with applicants nested within procedures and procedures nested within
studies. The predominant approach in meta-analysis is to analyze the procedure or study effects instead of the original
applicant-level data (Skrondal & Rabe-Hesketh, 2004, p. 301). For the data, where j indicates procedures, and k studies,
we consider the generalized linear mixed model of the log odds ratio (oj ), as defined in Eq. (1).
logit(oj ) = β0 + β1 xjk + ζ0jk + ζ1jk xjk + ζ0k + ζ1k xjk + εj ,
where



,

and
(ζ0j , ζ1j ) ∼ N(0,␺(2) )
(ζ0k , ζ1k ) ∼ N(0, ␺(3) )
Here β0 is a fixed intercept and ζ 0jk and ζ 0k the random intercepts, β1 a fixed slope and ζ 1jk and ζ 1k are the random
slopes of xjk . β1 represents the log odds ratio of interest (gender effect), whereas β1 + ζ 1jk + ζ 1k represents
 the estimated
‘true’ log odds ratio of the peer review procedure j examined in study k. The within-study deviations θj are simply
set equal to the standard errors of the log odds ratios, calculated out of the proportions given in Eq. (1) (Woolf’s
method). The sum of the terms ζ 0jk + ζ 1jk xjk + ζ 0k + ζ 1k xjk (the random part) can be thought of as a total residual ξ jk .
The variance of this total residual var(ξ jk ) is composed of six variance and covariance components: the variances of
the intercepts between procedure ζ 0jk and between studies ζ 0k , the variances of slopes between procedures ζ 1jk xjk and
between studies ζ 1k xjk , and the two covariances between intercepts and slopes on the two levels: cov(ζ 0jk , ζ 1jk xjk ),
cov(ζ 0k , ζ 1k xjk ). Thus, two matrices of variance/covariance components can be generated: one for the random effects
of the procedures ((2) ) and one for the random effects of the studies ((3) ). The generalized linear mixed model was
estimated by maximum likelihood using adaptive quadrature. For the analysis the gllamm-procedure (Rabe-Hesketh,
Skrondal, & Pickles, 2004) of the software STATA 9.0 (StataCorp., 2005) was used.
3. Results
Table 4 shows the maximum likelihood estimates for the generalized linear mixed model that examined gender
effect in grant peer review. The fixed part represents the overall regression on gender (men = −0.5; women = +0.5);
the random part represents the variability of regressions between procedures and between studies, as well as the
heterogeneity of effects (expressed as variances and covariances of intercepts and slopes). The estimate of β1 (−0.07)
in Table 4 (fixed part) gives, over all 66 peer review procedures analyzed in the 21 studies, the effect of the applicant’s
gender on the approval (i.e., funding) of grant applications. There appears to be strong evidence that the odds of
being approved for a grant are smaller for women than for men scientists, with an estimated odds ratio of exp(β1
−0.5 – β1 0.5) = exp(0.07) = 1.07. In other words, in grant peer review procedures, men have on average statistically
significantly greater odds of approval than women applying for grants by about 7%. Due to the high number of
different peer review procedures (n = 66, in terms of funding institutions, funding programs, fields of promotion, etc.)
and reviewed applications (n = 353,725) in our meta-analysis, the greater odds of approval for men compared to odds
of approval for women can be interpreted as a robust average gender effect in grant peer review (Shadish et al.,
2002).
The findings concerning the random part of the model estimation (see Table 4) suggest that there is a statistically
significant variability in the gender effect (preference for men over women) both at the level of the peer review
procedures (0.04) and at the level of the studies (0.07). Accordingly, even if a statistically significant gender effect can
be seen over all studies, the size of the effect in the individual peer review procedures varies widely. The z-value of the
corresponding variance components var(ζ 0jk ), var(ζ 1jk ) for procedures and var(ζ 0k ), var(ζ 1k ) for studies are significant.
Fig. 1 shows the variability of the gender effect between peer review procedures using “Empirical Bayes” estimates as
effect sizes and credible intervals for each peer review procedure (the figure shows both the names of the studies and

the research funding institutions (abbreviated) to which the peer review predictions refer). The proponents of Bayesian
statistics (Carlin & Louis, 2000) use credible intervals instead of confidence intervals in order to handle such complex
structures (Skrondal & Rabe-Hesketh, 2004). For a 95% credible interval, the posterior probability that the gender effect
parameter for a special procedure lies in the interval is 95%. In Fig. 1 negative mean log odds ratios point to a preference
for men, and positive mean log odds ratios to a preference for women in the peer review. The estimated individual
mean log odds ratios vary between −0.26 (Ackers, 2000a; Marie Curie) and 0.20 (Ackers, 2000d; Marie Curie). In
other words, the gender effects (odds ratios) vary over the studies within the range of 22.1% (exp(−0.26) = 1.221) in
favor of men and 22.9% (exp(−0.20) = 0.771) in favor of women applying for grants (however; Fig. 1 pointed clearly
out that there are only a few procedures with an effect in favor of women).
4. Discussion
Conventionally, peer review is regarded as a sure guarantee of good science. It reassures us about the quality of
scientific work and that the taxpayer’s money spent on science is well spent (Biagioli, 2002). The findings of our
quantitative review suggest, in contrast to recently published narrative reviews of the research on grant peer review
(Demicheli & Pietrantonj, 2004; Wood & Wessely, 2003), that there are overall robust gender differences in grant
peer review procedures. Although the parameter estimations of the gender effect vary substantially for the individual
procedures, the model estimation shows that among applicants for grants, men have greater odds of approval than
women by about 7%. In other words, in grant peer review the odds for approval of men’s grant applications are about
15:14 (for women the odds are reversed). This finding tallies with the conclusion of the National Science Foundation
(2003) on gender differences in the careers of academic scientists.
What importance can we attribute to this finding on the use of peer review for selection of applicants to receive
grants? Assume for a moment that worldwide in a certain time period decisions are made to approve and reject 100,000
grant applications (50,000 submitted by women and 50,000 submitted by men scientists). Half of these applications
are approved, and half are rejected. Based on the results of our meta-analysis, we can expect an approval rate for grant
applications submitted by men scientists of 52% (26,000 approvals). For grant applications submitted by women, we
can expect an approval rate of 48% (24,000 approvals). This makes a difference of 2000 approvals that is due to the
gender of the applicants.
However, the cause of this discrepancy is unknown. We tried to include characteristics of the peer review procedures
(see Table 2) into the model estimation to get some hints for potential causes. For instance, the proportions of women
and men for the procedures are highly aggregated over fields of study or disciplines, respectively. One could easily

L. Bornmann et al. / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 226–238

237

imagine that women are more likely to be represented in the softer sciences (such as social sciences) in which the
overall success rates are lower than those in the harder sciences (such as chemistry). Even if there are no gender
differences within fields of study, aggregation over fields of study can create a strong effect (“Simpson’s paradox”).
Another characteristic of the peer review procedures that might be of interest for inclusion into the model estimation
is the cohort of application. The data evaluated in the 21 studies refers to periods between 1979 and 2004. It is safe to
assume that in this period of time considerable progress has been made to reduce gender bias in science and science
funding.
Unfortunately, the inclusion of one or more of these characteristics into the calculation of the meta-analysis resulted
in models that did not converge in the estimation process. This finding indicated that the model estimation became too
complex by considering specific interaction effects or the included characteristics had no influence on the outcome,
respectively.
In the literature on peer review a number of possible causes for gender discrepancies are suggested or ruled out
by research findings. According to the study of Wennerås and Wold (1997) the differences are not the result of
differences in scientific productivity before applying for a grant (see also Bornmann & Daniel, 2005). The findings
of this well received study point out that we need other explanations. Instead, gender differences in grant peer review
procedures could be attributed to fewer women principal investigators applying for grants. Gender bias – whether
implicit or explicit – could come into play. According to Valian (1999) “one remedy for the salience of sex . . . is
having adequate numbers of women and men in any group being evaluated. That will make any given woman’s sex
less distinctive” (p. 309). The explanation for gender differences could be also institutional; there are more men in
higher-ranking positions than women (more men held senior rank positions than women), meaning fewer women are
in decision-making positions.
Whatever the cause, there are ways to rule out gender bias – whether intentional or unintentional – from the
grant-making process (for an overview about the wide range of ways, see Valian, 1999): one possible way is to mask
applicants’ gender (Bornmann, 2007). For example, it was found that “introducing a screen to obscure the gender
of musicians auditioning for symphony orchestra positions increased the likelihood that a woman was selected by
30–60%” (Handelsman et al., 2005, p. 1191). In journal peer review, masking authors’ gender has proved to be a
satisfactory precaution against gender as a potential source of bias (Horrobin, 1982). Masking is not equally suitable
for all document types of submissions, however. It is essentially impossible to pass valid judgment on a manuscript of
the short-communication type without some personal knowledge of the author (Daniel, 1993, 2004; Ziman, 1968).
It is questionable as well whether the gender of the applicant in grant peer review should be masked. Apart from
assessment of the grant applicant’s proposed research, decisions on applications are also based on an assessment of
the applicant’s track records (Cox, Gleser, Perlman, Reid, & Roeder, 1993). According to Gerlind Wallon, program
manager at the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO, Heidelberg, Germany), EMBO is planning an
experiment in which they will totally gender-blind the committee in the research fellowship selection process (the
results will be available by the end of 2007). As the example of the Pioneer Award for innovative research of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) shows, there are other effective measures against gender as
a potential source of bias. While in 2004 there were no women among the nine winners (Mervis, 2004), in 2005 about
half of the 13 scientists chosen for the Pioneer Award were women (Mervis, 2005). The improved chances for women
scientists were said to be attributable to the fact that, for example, (1) women were especially encouraged to apply, (2)
only self-nominations (rather than institutional submissions) were accepted and (3) the NIH spent more time schooling
its reviewers (Mervis, 2005).
