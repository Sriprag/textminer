A Review of Basic to Clinical Studies of Irreversible
Electroporation Therapy
Chunlan Jiang, Rafael V. Davalos, Member, IEEE, and John C. Bischof∗

Abstract—The use of irreversible electroporation (IRE) for cancer treatment has increased sharply over the past decade. As a nonthermal therapy, IRE offers several potential benefits over other
focal therapies, which include 1) short treatment delivery time, 2)
reduced collateral thermal injury, and 3) the ability to treat tumors
adjacent to major blood vessels. These advantages have stimulated
widespread interest in basic through clinical studies of IRE. For
instance, many in vitro and in vivo studies now identify treatment
planning protocols (IRE threshold, pulse parameters, etc.), electrode delivery (electrode design, placement, intraoperative imaging methods, etc.), injury evaluation (methods and timing), and
treatment efficacy in different cancer models. Therefore, this study
reviews the in vitro, translational, and clinical studies of IRE cancer
therapy based on major experimental studies particularly within
the past decade. Further, this study provides organized data and
facts to assist further research, optimization, and clinical applications of IRE.
Index Terms—Animal, clinical, enhancement, in vitro, irreversible electroporation (IRE).

I. INTRODUCTION
LECTROPORATION1 is a technique that utilizes highmagnitude electric pulses (thousands of V/cm) to induce
permeability increase in cell membranes. While some of the
molecular events that take place at the membrane level have not
been fully elucidated, there is general agreement in the literature
[1], [2] that nanometer-sized metastable structural defects or
“pores” are created when the plasma membrane is exposed to
the external pulsed electric field. These pores are thought to be
the source of the increased permeability from electroporation
first used for material (i.e., DNA, protein, etc.) transfer into
cells and then later as a therapeutic modality to treat diseases as
reviewed below.

1 A variety of terminology, such as electropermeabilization, has been used to
refer to the physics of this phenomenon.

The first observation of electroporation was reported in the
1950s on electrically stimulated membranes [3] and was described as “membrane breakdown,” which in more recent work
is considered to be an increase of membrane conductance or
permeability. Soon thereafter, the nonthermal killing effects of
strong electric field pulses were discovered and reported by
Sale in a study on microorganisms [4]. Many studies followed
into the early 1990s demonstrating the utility of electroporation
in molecular biology, mainly as a method to introduce foreign
molecules into living cells when electroporation is reversible.
Although further exploration and optimization for cancer continue, reversible electroporation has been used for decades for
molecular and gene transfer in vitro [5]–[7].
The introduction of electroporation to cancer therapy originated from drug delivery applications. Specifically, electroporation was used to assist uptake of chemotherapeutic drug
molecules into tumor cells [8]. The pairing of electroporation
and chemotheapeutic drug quickly gained popularity and now
exists as an independent treatment termed electrochemotherapy
(ECT) which is in clinical practice [9]–[11]. The reported objective response rates of ECT range from 72% to 100% [12], [13]
and is one of the most well-established clinical applications of
electroporation today [14].
In 2005, the concept of using electroporation as a monotherapy (i.e., without cytotoxic drugs or in conjunction with thermal effects) to destroy tissue was proposed by Davalos et al.
[15]. The term “irreversible electroporation (IRE)” was used
to distinguish between cell destruction rather than reversible
permeabilization used in previous embodiments of electroporation for molecular biology applications. In this study, IRE alone
showed the ability to destroy undesirable tissues in the body
in a manner similar to more traditional focal thermal therapies
such as radiofrequency (RF) heating or cryosurgery. The advantages over thermal therapies were immediately realized due to
IRE’s potential to: 1) reduce treatment time, 2) reduce collateral thermal effects (i.e., overtreatment), and 3) avoid influence
of local blood perfusion on treatment outcome (i.e., no blood
sink or source to heat transfer). These advantages quickly triggered widespread interest from the scientific community leading
to many studies both in vitro [16]–[19] and in vivo [20]–[24].
Further, a wide variety of cell [16]–[19], organ [25]–[27], and
animal [20], [23], [28] models have been used to characterize
the destructive potential of IRE for different cancer types.
These studies have provided valuable experimental results
and treatment planning protocols (IRE threshold, pulse parameters, etc.) including electrode delivery (electrode design, placement, intraoperative imaging methods, etc.), injury evaluation
(methods and timing), and treatment efficacy. While reviews of

IRE are now beginning to be published [1], [2], [31]–[35], a summary and categorization of basic to clinical IRE studies allowing
ready access and comparison between protocols and parameters
has not yet been provided for researchers and clinicians who are
new to the field or would like a more comprehensive reference.
Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to critically review the in vitro, translational, and clinical work based on major experimental studies on IRE therapy in the past decade,
and provide organized data and facts to assist further research,
optimization, and clinical applications with IRE.
II. PROPOSED MECHANISMS OF IRE
A more complete treatment of this topic can be found in many
reviews of the subject [29], [33], [36]–[39]. However, for completeness and later discussion, a brief overview of mechanisms
is given here.
Electroporation is essentially a membrane phenomenon that
involves behavior of the lipid plasma membrane under the intense stimulation of external electric field. The early observation of electroporation dates back more than half a century
ago [3]. However, it was not until the 1970s that insights into
IRE mechanisms began to accumulate with the development
of experimental platforms. Using a natural vesicular membrane
system, Neumann and Rosenheck [40] detected the release of
catecholamines induced by intense electric field and confirmed
the transient change of membrane permeability during electroporation. In a subsequent series of studies [41]–[46], it was suggested that the site of interaction between the electric field and
the cell subjects was the cell membrane. These findings stimulated great interest in modeling the membrane lipid system and
developing membrane-based mechanisms for electroporation.
The potential distribution surrounding an isolated spherical cell (see Fig. 1) [30] with a nonconducting membrane in
an external electric field Eext can be described by Laplace
equation and has the following solution for the transmembrane
voltage (U ):

where r is the radius of the cell, and θ is the angle between the
site on the cell membrane where U is measured and the direction

of Eext , f (mV/(V/cm)) is a coefficient introduced to reflect the
influence of cell packing density, i.e., the ratio of cell radius to
cell separation distance, and the membrane charging time constant τc determined by Cm (specific membrane capacitance), σi
and σe (intracellular and extracellular specific conductivities)
[36], [47]–[50]. Following this approximation, for a typical eukaryotic cell with a radius of r = 10 μm, it takes a field strength
of 667 V/cm to achieve a transmembrane voltage of 1 V [29].
It should be noted that (1) holds true just prior to the onset of
electroporation. As noted by DeBruin and Krassowska [50], the
potential drop across the membrane dampens at the poles at the
onset of electroporation. Three papers by Kinosita are pioneering demonstrations of some basic features of electroporation
[51]–[53] and are almost entirely explained by the cell model of
Krassowska and Filev [48]. Only the experimentally observed
transmembrane voltage and underlying pore distribution asymmetry are not explained by this model.
There have been several different types of theoretical models
explaining membrane stability at elevated transmembrane voltages. In earlier studies, it was suggested that membrane rupture
is caused by an electromechanical collapse due to the compression of the entire membrane [54]. However, according to this
model, there is a deterministic threshold for each specific cell
type, which is contradictory to the stochastic nature of IRE from
experiments. Based on the earlier studies by Litster [55], [56]
on stability of spontaneous pores on membranes, Weaver and
Mintzer [57] proposed an energy-based pore formation model
for membrane rupture during electroporation. In this model, the
free energy for pore formation is dependent on both the membrane properties and the applied external electric field


ΔE (R, U ) = 2πR · λ − πR2 · σ + aU 2
where ΔE (R, U ) is the free energy to create a pore of radius
R, λ and σ are the edge line tension and surface tension of
the membrane, respectively, and a represents the contrast of
dielectric constants of water and lipid. This model accounts
for factors of both the applied external electric field and the
membrane’s intrinsic physical properties, such as line tension
and surface tension, which could also influence the outcome
of electroporation [58] (see Fig. 2). Furthermore, it allows for
estimation of the pore formation rate with calculations described
in [29], [59], and [60].
The mechanisms whereby cells die post IRE continue to be
actively investigated. Several mechanisms with experimental

completely reseal after electroporation, many secondary events,
such as electroconformational protein denaturation [36], osmotic imbalance, flush in/out of ions [67], depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [68], and uptake of toxic/foreign
molecules [13], could occur before complete pore reseal and
may eventually result in cell death. Numerous studies have reported the “delay” of injury development after electroporation
[27], [68], [69]. ECT also takes advantage of the permeability
change during electroporation to introduce cytotoxic drugs to
kill cancer cells [70]. Studies have shown that the secondary
events mentioned above could potentially cause more injury
than primary membrane pore [68].
In summary, the current understanding of IRE is that it is
linked to and occurs within the plasma membrane. There tends
to be general agreement about the pore formation process although how the membrane recovers is poorly understood and
an area of ongoing research [29], [32], [38], [71]. Two possible
explanations of cell death are permanent membrane lysis or loss
of homeostasis (i.e., loss of cellular contents prior to resealing).

support have been proposed and are reviewed here. One mechanism is lethal membrane disruption from repetitive electrical
pulsing. This lethal event is predicted in existing electroporation theories [1], [2], [29], [37], [59] considering the creation
of aqueous pores. Direct visualization of the transient pore formation process has been elusive due to the combination of time
scale and spatial resolution limit of the imaging methods. However, attempts based on “fix-then-process” approaches have been
made to observe the membrane pore induced by electroporation. Using electron microscopy (EM), Chang and Reese [61]
were able to observe “pore-like” structures from rapid frozen
electroporation treated samples [see Fig. 3(a)]. Because direct
poration is difficult to detect, researchers have often resorted
to indirect measurements which may support either poration or
permeabilization. For instance, sharp changes in electrical conductivity can reflect alteration of membrane permeability and
can be used to detect the occurrence of electroporation [62]–
[65]. Dye uptake and volumetric response of cells [see Fig. 3(b)]
have also been used to evaluate pore formation during electroporation [16]–[18], [66]. In addition, for the nonvital pores that

The majority of research on in vitro electroporation was conducted for molecular biology applications before IRE was proposed as a tissue destruction modality. The in vitro model systems were typically cell suspension in cuvettes and microfluidic
channels that are also systems that have been studied for molecular biology applications, such as genetic transfection and in
vitro drug testing. Nevertheless, the goal of most of these applications is to increase the uptake of desired molecules while
minimizing cell injury (i.e., reversible electroporation). It is beyond the scope of this paper to include all of these results here
although the interested reader can find numerous reviews in this
area [7], [72], [73]. Thus, in this paper, only the studies with IRE
(i.e., cell destruction) as the goal, or those that provided insights
on electroporation mechanisms relevant to cell destruction are
included.
A. In Vitro Models
The in vitro model systems for IRE that have been studied
and published in literature can be classified into three categories
based on the type of membrane studied [29], [71]. These categories include 1) artificial membrane systems, including lipid
bilayer sheet membrane [74], [75] or vesicles [40], 2) isolated
single cells [63], [76], and 3) cell suspension in cuvettes or microfluidic channels [16]–[19]. The artificial membrane models
ignore the intercellular and intracellular structures and, therefore, cannot account for how these structures may affect cell
death pathways. However, due to their simplicity, artificial membrane models are easy to manipulate and image and, therefore,
have contributed to numerous insights at the membrane level,
such as direct observation of membrane surface change and
measurements of pore formation timing and size [40], [41],
[43]–[45], [74]. Single-cell models isolate the individual cells
from their extracellular environment and provide access for cell
behavior by direct observation and measurements of electrical
properties. Early experimental studies chose larger cells (e.g.,

JIANG et al.: REVIEW OF BASIC TO CLINICAL STUDIES OF IRREVERSIBLE ELECTROPORATION THERAPY

muscle cells and oocytes) due to the ease of manipulation [63],
[77], [78]. More recently, microfluidic devices allow researchers
to conduct electroporation on smaller cells (tens of micrometer in diameter) using micropipette tips and microelectrodes
[79]–[84]. The cell suspension model is the most widely used
experimental system for in vitro cell destruction studies. It allows observation of a group of cells under external electrical
stimulation. Here, membrane or extracellular properties can be
adjusted by changing or adding components in the medium, allowing optimization of IRE conditions [16]–[18], [58]. Importantly, cell suspensions allow measurement of ensemble average
behavior within a cell population, whereas individual cell behavior requires more specialized microfluidic or other platforms
as already mentioned.
B. Electroporation Time Frame
The generation of transmembrane potentials that can affect
IRE in a large lipid vesicle (∼40 μm) or a single cell (∼50 μm)
typically happens on the order of microseconds [32], [50], [62],
[85]. Once formed, pores in the lipid domain can last milliseconds to seconds after the external electric field is removed, as
has been shown for bilayer lipid membranes or lipid vesicles
[41]. Experimentally, the kinetics of membrane changes during
electroporation have been monitored by permeability, conductivity, fluorescence imaging, and EM [51], [52], [61], [86]–[92].
Among the first recorded event is a pore initiation in the microsecond range that can be measured by permeability changes
and confirmed by leakage experiment [89], [93]. Interestingly,
these pores can persist for longer times. For instance, EM detects pore-like structures after 10 ms after pulse termination
[61], and they lasted in some cases up to 10 s which was quite
unexpected. Another EM study observed pore like structures
at 15 min or even 24 h after IRE treatment in tissue [94]. One
possible explanation is that EM is visualizing large pore-like imprints due to secondary effects during recovery rather than pores
themselves [85].
Importantly, both theory and experiment indicate that electroporation induces membrane events within a membrane charging
time that is less than microseconds. The amount of time it takes
for a membrane to demonstrate pores from electroporation can
range from microseconds to milliseconds. After the external
electrical field is withdrawn, it may take the membrane seconds to hours to recover if immediate lethal injury has been
avoided (see Fig. 4). Importantly, each of the time frames above
depends strongly on the cell/membrane type and the applied
electric field. Therefore, the time frame illustrated in Fig. 4 is
only qualitative. It would be of great interest to find models that
make quantitative predictions of the electroporation time frame
for specific cell/membrane types.
C. Injury Mechanisms and Evaluation
As already mentioned, pore formation does not necessarily result in cell death. The critical cellular injury comes from either
direct membrane destruction (irreversible pore, rupture, etc.)
that deployed cytoskeleton (and/or extracellular matrix connection to the cell through proteins), or secondary effect such as

electroporation.

osmolarity imbalance, loss of critical organelles, or influx of
cytotoxic molecules that eventually result in cell death. Therefore, it is important to examine existing in vitro injury evaluation
methods and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.
The classic membrane integrity dye assay (PI, Hoechst, Trypan blue, etc.) is simple, inexpensive, and detects direct membrane defects. However, several questions need to be carefully
considered before using membrane integrity assays. First, when
should the dye be introduced? This is important since it is possible that both reversible and irreversible pores are present in
the membrane during IRE. So, if the dye is introduced before
IRE, the “dead” cell count will be biased as cells with only reversible pores may eventually survive and yet will be counted
as dead. On the other hand, if the dye is introduced after IRE,
reversible pores may seal after dye entry into the cell after seconds to hours. One rule of thumb if dyes are used is to keep
the time period (usually minutes) after loading constant and report it with their experimental results. Second, how long will
the dye be incubated? This is important since after prolonged
incubation, secondary injury from IRE will tend to increase cell
death by dye count over time. The timing of such processes
is unpredictable and may result in inconsistent viability if the
waiting period is varied. Therefore, the timing of dye application and incubation time need to be carefully controlled and
considered when comparing results obtained from one study to
another using membrane integrity dye assays.
NAD(P)H-dependent cellular oxidoreductase enzymatic
(MTT, XTT, CCK, etc.) assays are another class viability assays.
These colorimetric assays measure the activity of cellular enzymes which reduce the tetrazolium based dyes via NAD(P)Hdependent metabolic activities, thereby reflecting the number of
viable cells present. The advantage of this type of assay is that it
can detect a dead (or dying) cell under conditions other assays
cannot. For instance, the dye assay can only detect cell death
when the membrane is compromised whereas NAD(P)H assay
can detect cell death when it is still intact. However, NAD(P)Hdependent assay does not have the capability to differentiate
between metabolically dormant and dead cells. In addition,

environmental conditions that affect the cell metabolic activity can alter the cell viability results as well.
Finally, ATP is a molecule found in and produced by living cells that can be measured and used as a viability assay.
Specifically, ATP levels can be quantified by measuring the
light emitted through its reaction with luciferase reagents using
a luminometer. The amount of light produced is directly proportional to the amount of living cells present in the sample.
ATP assay can suffer from similar limitations of the NAD(P)Hbased assays in that it is unable to differentiate metabolically
mute cells from dead ones and can also vary with the environmental conditions.
D. IRE Parameters and Outcomes
This section is an attempt to tabulate and compare the IRE
parameters between the in vitro studies that have been published
using the above assays to date. Due to the wide variations of
experimental configurations and evaluation methods, the choice
of IRE parameters varies greatly among studies reviewed in
Table I. The applied electric field can range from hundreds
to thousands of V/cm. The pulse number can range from 1
to more than 3800, and pulse duration can range from under
100 μs to 300 ms. Unfortunately, most studies did not report
pulsing frequency, which is also an influential parameter in
electroporation [58], [95]. In terms of injury assessment, more
than half the studies have chosen membrane dye or NAD(P)Hbased assay (or both) as their viability assay. Some studies have
adopted the viability assay that is more specific to their choice
of cell line (e.g., the RBC ghost assay).
One of the first systematic studies of parameters needed for
IRE of cancer cells was performed in vitro by Rubinsky’s group
using cell suspensions in a cuvette [16]. In this study, the researchers tested IRE electric field strengths in the range of
125 V/cm to 2000 V/cm, and pulse numbers from 1 to 3840
(see Fig. 5). The pulse duration was kept constant in this study

at 100 μs. A total of 90 pulses at 250 V/cm for 100 μs separated by 100 ms were found to completely destroy prostate
cancer cells without inducing thermal damage. Counter to most
studies they found that lower electrical fields can be more effective than higher fields for IRE. However, they did not provide
data on the influence of each individual parameter (i.e., varying
electric field, pulse number, and pulse duration independently
while keeping the other two constant). Nevertheless, this was
the beginning of systematic study of IRE parameters for cell
destruction.
A more recent overview of electroporation parameters on IRE
has been presented by Weaver et al. [32]. Here, combinations
spanning three orders of magnitude in pulse strength (i.e., electric field) and nine orders of magnitude in pulse duration were
discussed. In this review as with the bulk of the literature, higher
field strengths (1–10 kV/cm) and longer pulses (μs–ms) were
more successful at inducing IRE. Although this destruction appears to be necrotic, even higher field strengths (10–100 kV/cm)
and shorter pulses (<μs) led to apoptosis (an emerging concept
called supra electroporation). Finally, lower field strength and
short pulses tend to lead to survival, which appears to be in
conflict with Rubinsky’s original paper [16]. This may demonstrate the need for simultaneously varying all three parameters
in a single cell type to fully explore biological response to
electroporation.
To assess all three IRE parameters independently, our group
recently performed an in vitro study in a prostate cancer cell
line (LNCaP Pro 5) and a cardiac cell line (HL-1) using the
cuvette cell suspension setup (see Fig. 6) [96]. We observed that
due to the stochastic nature of IRE, even high electric fields
cannot guarantee death of the entire cell population if the pulse
number or duration is low. For instance in the HL-1 case, the
viability first starts to drop below 90% when electrical field
exceeded 750 V/cm. This number can be considered as a lower
threshold for this cell type. Complete cell death (greater than
90%) can be achieved when the electric field is above 1250 V/cm

given sufficient pulse number or duration. In between 750 and
1250 V/cm, the cells are injured but may not actually die as a
result of acute IRE injury. It is worth noting that in our study,
when the electric field is lower than 500 V/cm, simply increasing
the pulse number or duration does not lead to higher cell injury.
This is also contradictory to Rubinsky’s study [16], in which
complete cell death (100%) can be achieved for electric field
as low as 125 V/cm. However, the pulse number range in our
study (up to 90) is far less than that in Rubinsky’s study (up to
3840). It would be interesting to investigate low electric field
(lower than 500 V/cm) induction of complete cell death from
IRE given sufficient pulse number, and how this can be related
to clinical applications. It is worth noting that pulse repetition
frequency and timing (delay between pulses) can also influence
the outcome of IRE therapy [58], [95]. The same pulse generator
(BTX ECM 830) and pulsing frequency (10 Hz) were used in
the above two studies.
In summary, despite some variations, general trends do appear to hold from these studies. For example, the majority of
field strengths used in in vitro IRE studies fall between 1000–
2000 V/cm, which is above the theoretical threshold calculation of 667 V/cm to induce IRE injury as discussed with (1)
and in previous work by Weaver and Chizmadzhev [29]. Both
pulse number and duration have major impact on the electric
field threshold and need to be carefully accounted for during
IRE treatment planning. Finally, pulse repetition frequency and
timing can also influence the outcome of IRE and should be
considered when comparing results from different studies.
IV. TRANSLATIONAL STUDIES OF IRE
Since Davalos et al. [15] first proposed the use of electroporation as a means of soft tissue destruction, a great number
of preclinical tests have been undertaken to support this new
modality. Among them, in vivo testing on animal organs has
generated the most abundant data and useful conclusions so far.
The goal of this section is to summarize these experimental findings and categorize them in a manner that is readily available for
clinicians and researchers relatively new to the field. A complete
summary of these in vivo studies can be found in Table II and
will be the basis of our discussion in the following sections.

tissue destruction. In this design, the cathode and/or the anode
are integrated onto a needle shaped delivery system, which is
inserted to the target site. The needle electrodes are relatively
less invasive, yet provide easy manipulation for placement. The
number of needle electrode(s) can be one, two, or more [see
Fig. 7(b)]. However, the electric field generated by needle electrode(s) is not homogeneous and needs to be carefully calculated
before treatment using simulation software [15], [117]. Adding
electrode number and optimizing the electrode placement can
help increase the effective treatment volume, but this can make
the treatment more invasive and complicate the procedure [118].
In the clamp electrode design, the cathode and the anode are integrated onto the inner faces of a clamp, which is used to hold
the target tissue from the outside. The clamp design can also be
invasive and suffers similar limitations as the plate electrode.
However, it can provide more secure contact that works better
for specific organs, such as arteries and intestines, during open
surgery. Finally, in the catheter electrode design, the electrodes
are delivered via a catheter inside the tubular organ. Good contact is usually ensured by placing the electrodes on a balloon
surface or preshaped nickel titanium (nitinol) wires [115]. It requires specific skill to manipulate and navigate to the target site
but can be the least invasive of all the designs.
Several researchers have expressed concerns about the impact
of electrode size to the actual treatment volume. For instance,
with the needle electrode design, it has been found that the
smaller the diameter of the electrode, the higher the voltage
needed [98], [117] to create the same treatment volume if all
other parameters are the same. This is because the decrease
of electric field intensity in the vicinity of the electrodes is
steeper at smaller diameters of the electrodes; therefore, the
area covered with a given electric field intensity is smaller at
smaller diameters of electrodes.
When multiple electrodes are used, the distance between the
electrodes [see Fig. 7(c)] and critical organs are critical parameters. For instance, in the heart, Deodhar et al. [103] has found
that within 1.7 cm from the heart, fatal events occurred with
all unsynchronized IRE in a study of 11 pigs with lung and
myocardium tissue destructions. ECG synchronized IRE delivery could avoid significant cardiac arrhythmias although minor
events still present.

A. Tissue IRE Electrodes
There are four major types of IRE electrodes: plate, needle,
clamp, and catheter. Their popularity in usage can be found in
Fig. 7(a). The plate electrode design delivers the electric field
by placing two parallel plate electrodes across the target tissue.
It can provide homogeneous electric field distribution between
the plate electrodes in the target area. The electric field is easy
to determine and is relatively well constrained between the two
plates. However, plate electrodes are much more invasive if they
need to be placed inside the body. Their usage can also be limited due to the difficulty of placement and having to maintain the
relative parallel position between the two plates. Therefore, they
are more often considered when the target tissue is more easily
accessible (e.g., during an open surgery). The needle electrodes
are the most popular selection reviewed (58% of all cases) for

B. IRE Pulse Parameters (Electric Field, Pulse Duration,
and Pulse Number)
Although many parameters can influence the outcome of IRE
for a given tissue type, the electric field, pulse duration, and
pulse number are the most experimentally studied. Importantly,
new experimental data suggests that pulse delays can also have
dramatic impact on outcome [58], [95]. This suggests the need
for additional experimental and theoretical research, as most
biomedical technologies eventually need mechanistic support
for adoption and full acceptance. It is worth noting that there
are discrepancies in the way that the electric field is presented in
the literature (i.e., field V/cm versus potential V). We represent
what we can glean from these studies in Table II. It can be
seen that the majority (89%) of researchers used an electric

field between 1000 and 2500 V/cm for tissue destruction. The
pulse durations ranged from 50 to 100 μs in 87% of the studies
reviewed [see Fig. 7(d)]. And finally, the pulse number ranged
between 10 and 90 for most studies [see Fig. 7(e)]. As was
discussed in our in vitro section, it requires a certain amount
of cumulative pulse time to achieve complete cell death even
when above threshold electric field level. This can be achieved
by either increasing the pulse duration or the total pulse number.
However, there are constraints on increasing pulse duration due

to Joule heating (i.e., thermal effects) [119], and procedure time
is lengthened by increasing pulse number.
C. Injury Evaluation
The injury evaluation in tissue is more complex than in vitro
or cell cases. For instance, the injury can be monitored in real
time intraoperatively or after a procedure in an acute or chronic
manner. The injury can also be evaluated on live animals, or

postmortem. The injury evaluation methods used are summarized in Fig. 8.
MRI, Ultrasound, and CT scanning are all direct noninvasive
imaging methods for live animals. They can be performed any
time before, during, or after the procedure. A good review on
imaging methods for IRE tumor treatments is given in [121].
Using these modalities, the IRE lesion has been shown to be
hypointense under T1-MRI or hyperintense under T2-MRI by
Guo et al. [28] or hyperintense for both TI and T2 MRI in
[22], [102]. In the case of ultrasound, lesions were shown to
be hypointense during, and hyperintense 24 h after IRE [23],
[122], [123]. Finally, for CT imaging, both intraoperative and

follow up scans found hypodense nonenhancing lesion [26].
Not all studies have detailed imaging methods and results, and
some studies appear contradictory suggesting an opportunity for
further work.
Histological assessment of (usually H&E) stained samples is
the most used evaluation method for IRE therapy postmortem
[23], [64], [97], [98]. The lesion volume measured from the
histology sample can vary greatly depending on the time after
IRE treatment, as was described as injury development in vivo
[23], [112]. In general, follow-up to a minimum of three days is
necessary to evaluate the injury development unless only acute
injury is of interest.
TTC (Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) staining is similar to
the NAD(P)H-based assay for in vitro assessment and is used
to differentiate metabolically active and inactive tissues. Compared to histology staining, TTC is faster and less expensive.
However, the TTC stained samples cannot be stored and used at
a later time like the histology samples. Both the start and incubation timing can affect the viability results. Therefore, careful
study is necessary to establish the TTC timing for a specific
tissue of interest [124], [125].
Optical methods can use fluorescent dyes in intravitally imaged tissues (i.e., dorsal skin fold) to examine the perfusion
defects after IRE treatment. Like the histological assessment,
perfusion defects can change as the injury develops in tissue.
However, since the same animal can be imaged repeatedly over
time, intravital approaches typically require less animals and

money to study the injury compared to histology [58], [108],
[126] or tumor growth delay.
Tumor regression or growth delay is another method to determine the treatment efficacy of IRE. Although tumor regression
results have been reported in some studies [107], [109], [122],
large-scale randomized animal studies are still not available on
IRE therapy at this time.
Since IRE is still more often used in combination with
chemotherapy or other enhancement reagents, the influence of
chemo drug (bleomycin or other cytotoxic agents) or adjuvants
on the viability results needs to be carefully accounted for.
Specifically, it is important not to confuse the combinatorial
IRE therapy outcomes with independent IRE monotherapy, as
the results of the two are not directly comparable.
D. Outcomes and Thresholds
The IRE thresholds are mainly determined by overlapping the
modeled electric field distribution with the lesion volume measured from viability studies. Most in vivo studies have found the
threshold to be 500–1000 V/cm (see Table II). It is important
to note that the field thresholds reported in vivo are highly dependent on how the researchers calculated the field distribution
in the tissue. In addition, care should be taken when comparing in vivo to in vitro due to a number of factors, in particular
difference in cell shape. Nevertheless, in vitro studies can help
glean insight into the roles of secondary parameters such as
pulse duration and repetition rate. The lesion size determined
by these studies varies greatly due to different viability assays
and timing of assessment (intraoperative, post treatment, etc.)
and different tissue/animal subject. In general, the IRE treatment volume is relatively small in our surveyed studies [25],
[28], [63], [116]. Although one could consider the use of high
voltages in the living body to be a safety concern, it is important
to realize that the energy delivered is extremely low due to the
short duration of the pulses. IRE usages were shown to be safe
during tissue destruction in the studies surveyed here. Specifically, all animals treated with IRE survived after the treatment
and only few cases have reported side effects associated with
electrical shocking such as temporal muscle contraction and arrhythmia [23], [103]. More recent studies have adopted ECG
synchronized IRE combined with general anesthesia to address
the above side effects.
V. CLINICAL STUDIES
Electroporation has been used clinically for more than
15 years in combination with chemotherapy, and is on the rise
as a monotherapy over the last five years. Internationally, there
are a number of ongoing clinical trials of IRE therapy [118],
[127]–[133]. In 2010, Pech et al. [128] (Germany) reported the
first in-man clinical study with IRE treatment on kidney (n =
6). The study was for safety verification only. The tumors were
surgically resected 5 min after IRE, and no treatment protocol was recorded in that paper. In 2011, Thomson et al. [129]
(Australia) published a larger scale study of various organs.
They investigated ECG synchronized IRE in 38 humans with
advanced malignancy of liver (n = 25), kidney (n = 7), and
lung (n = 3), a total of 69 separate tumors (average = 46 cm3 ).

Tumor destruction verified by CT was achieved in 66% (46/69)
tumors. Complications found in this study include cardiac arrhythmia, temporary plexus injury, partial ureteric obstruction,
and short-term post-procedure pain. In 2013, Robert et al. [132]
(Australia) reported another IRE study on 11 patients with 18
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma that were not suitable for
RF treatment. The mean follow-up period was 18 months. Thirteen of the 18 (72%) lesions were completely destroyed. The
translated to a 93% success rate for lesions ࣘ3 cm (13/14). The
local recurrence-free period was 18 ± 4 months and the distance
recurrence-free period was 14 ± 6 months. No serious complications were observed in this study, although minor issues such as
transient urinary retention, transient local post-procedure pain,
and lesions lying adjacent to important structures or organs. In
2014, Neal et al. [134] (Australia) reported two cases of IRE
treatment of prostate cancer 3–4 weeks before surgical resection to evaluate safety and characterize the relevant properties to
improve treatment planning and outcome predictions. IRE has
also been investigated for locally advanced pancreatic cancer in
a series of studies by Martin et al. [133], [135] and found to be
safe and effective at local management of the disease.
A further list of clinical trials that are recruiting patients and
registered in the U.S. can be found in Table III. From this table,
we can see that the number and scale of clinical studies on IRE
have greatly increased since 2013 (see Fig. 9). A systematic
review of the safety and efficacy of IRE therapy in clinical
setting can be found in [136].
VI. LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES OF IRE
Despite the advantage and progress discussed above, IRE is
still not the preferred choice of treatment for most diseases.
IRE is usually considered only when other therapies are not
applicable or fail to show an improvement. This lack of acceptance of IRE within the medical community is due in part to
the status of development of the technology, and to several issues with the outcomes of IRE. Specifically, IRE has shown an
inability to destroy large volumes of tissues without repetition
or repositioning the electrodes. This is an important limitation
that remains to be fully addressed. For instance, the common
lesion sizes reviewed in Table III using one pair of electrodes
without repositioning the electrodes are <1 cm3 [25], [28], [63],
[116]. This is because larger electric fields (i.e., ࣙ2500 V/cm)
needed to create larger lesions may increase the damage to adjacent nerves and the cardiovascular system [103], [137]. One
approach to circumvent these high fields while treating larger
lesions is to use multiple electrodes or repeat treatment with
repositioned electrodes. Theoretically, with well-planned electrode layouts, a larger and customized lesion could be achieved
to completely destroy a target tumor. However, the addition of
multiple electrodes increases the complexity and difficulty of
the procedure and makes the treatment more invasive.
A further limitation of IRE treatment is the resulting heterogeneity of injury within the target treatment zone. For instance,
some studies [28], [108] now show that incomplete treatment
(live tumor patches in a target treated zone) have been found after
IRE, leading to concerns such as recurrence. If unresolved, this
represents a threat to the translation of IRE. Importantly, local

[12], [13]. A similar method proposed by Frandsen et al. [68]
uses direct intratumoral calcium injection followed by electroporation, leading to lethal intracellular calcium events. While
promising, cytotoxic drug or molecules are still limited by the
dose and side effects, thus further methods remain of interest to
research and clinical groups.

recurrence after hyperthermia and cryosurgery is significant and
reported in the clinical literature [138]–[140]. However, having
studied preclinical lesions for IRE, heat, and cryo in an identical animal model, the appearance of live tumor patches within
the treated tumor volume (rather than at the boundary) appears
at this stage to be unique for electroporation [108], [141]. It is
possible that the live cell patches are a result of local electrical
property heterogeneity within the tumor tissue, thereby lowering the effective electric field in the target region [142]. Thus, a
key challenge to IRE cancer therapy is how to ensure the electric
field distribution over the entire target region is above the IRE
threshold. This can be achieved through pretreatment planning
and monitoring electric field distribution [90], [91], or by enhancements that either alter the field impact and/or reduce the
IRE threshold in the tissue [58], [74].
VII. POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENT APPROACHES
A. Cytotoxic Agents
In recognition of the smaller volume or potential for heterogeneous response within the tissue, several groups have already
championed a combinatorial approach as mentioned earlier in
the review entitled: “electrochemotherapy.” This method uses
electroporation to allow chemotherapeutics such as bleomycin,
which are normally not taken up by cells, to more easily internalize and destroy cells and is reviewed in more detail elsewhere

High-Frequency IRE (H-FIRE) is another promising enhancement approach for IRE therapy. Unlike conventional IRE,
H-FIRE protocols involve the use of microsecond bursts of bipolar pulses on the order of 500 ns to 5 μs, delivered at a pulse
repetition rate of 1 Hz [101], [143]. The benefit of H-FIRE is
that it provides the ability to administer IRE therapy without
the use of neuroblocking agents to mitigate muscle contractions
during the procedure [101]. In addition, high-frequency fields
have the potential to overcome impedance barriers posed by
low-conductivity tissues, which could provide more predictable
lesion volumes. For instance, H-FIRE may mitigate the effects
of patient-to-patient tissue variability, conductivity changes due
to electroporation, and tissue heterogeneities [143]. While HFIRE is a relatively unexplored area of research, it may prove
interesting if a positive relationship between H-FIRE parameters
and larger treatment volumes can be established [32].
C. Membrane Modifications
Another class of studies focuses on enhancing the destructive
efficacy of IRE itself without relying on chemotherapeutic drugs
or cytotoxic agents to enter and kill the cancer cells. Specifically,
approaches that directly modify membrane properties (i.e., line
tension and surface tension) by surfactants, impeding the resealing process (big molecules, channel holders, etc.), and fine
tuning the pulse timing have all been tried and shown effective
in enhancing the IRE destructive potential, as summarized in
Table IV.
For instance, one study on IRE enhancement with DMSO
has shown that over 60% increase in cell destruction in vitro
and greater than 136% increase in treatment volume in vivo
can be achieved by adding 5% volume percentage of DMSO

to the cell suspension or perfused into the tissue [58]. Another
study on a lipid bilayer model has shown that as low as 0.1 μM
of C12 E8 can lower the IRE transmembrane voltage threshold
from 450 to 333 mV [74]. The enhancement effect of C12 E8
has also been studied in vitro [144]. Moreover, studies have
shown that simply varying the timing of the pulses without
changing the total pulse number or electric field can increase
the cell destruction by 67% in vitro [145] and tissue destruction
volume by 101% in vivo [58], respectively. Because the pulse
timing approach does not introduce any foreign molecules into
the body, it enhances the efficacy of IRE with no additional cost
beyond fractionally longer treatment times (minutes). Further,
it can be combined with existing IRE protocols (with or without
other enhancements).
The number and variety of studies on IRE enhancement is
still limited at this time. However, initial results are promising,
suggesting that enhancement can increase the treated volume
thereby potentially addressing one of the major hurdles to effective clinical translation.

VIII. CONCLUSION
Although IRE was only introduced less than a decade ago, numerous preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted to
characterize its destructive potential for different cancer types.
Many encouraging results have been reported and unique benefits have been observed in IRE compared to other focal therapies.
However, to help establish IRE as a reliable cancer treatment
modality in the clinic, further understanding of injury mechanisms, different cell and tissue response, and feedback from
imaging approaches are still needed. Future opportunities also
exist in establishing well-defined treatment planning protocols,
improving the treatment delivery methods, and optimizing treatment outcomes with enhancement approaches.
