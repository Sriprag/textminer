Inverse Estimation of Multiple Muscle Activations
From Joint Moment With Muscle Synergy Extraction
Zhan Li, David Guiraud, Member, IEEE, and Mitsuhiro Hayashibe, Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—Human movement is produced resulting from synergetic combinations of multiple muscle contractions. The resultant
joint movement can be estimated through the related multiplemuscle activities, which is formulated as the forward problem.
Neuroprosthetic applications may benefit from cocontraction of
agonist and antagonist muscle pairs to achieve more stable and
robust joint movements. It is necessary to estimate the activation
of each individual muscle from desired joint torque(s), which is
the inverse problem. A synergy-based solution is presented for
the inverse estimation of multiple muscle activations from joint
movement, focusing on one degree-of-freedom tasks. The approach
comprises muscle synergy extraction via the nonnegative matrix
factorization algorithm. Cross validation is performed to evaluate
the method for prediction accuracy based on experimental data
from ten able-bodied subjects. The results demonstrate that the
approach succeeds to inversely estimate the multiple muscle activities from the given joint torque sequence. In addition, the other
one’s averaged synergy ratio was applied for muscle activation estimation with leave-one-out cross-validation manner, which resulted
in 9.3% estimation error over all the subjects. The obtained results support the common muscle synergy-based neuroprosthetics
control concept.
Index Terms—Electromyography (EMG), inverse problem, muscle activations, muscle synergy.

I. INTRODUCTION
ATIENTS in need of rehabilitation, assistance, and neuroprosthetics are increasing in our aging society all over
the world. Reducing the expected cost for the health care of
aging society is really a critical problem [1]. The social benefit that could be derived from advanced computational methods in motor rehabilitation would be quite important, because
restoration of muscle motor capability by means of neuroprosthetics could be beneficial to improvement of quality of life
for motor-impaired patients during their daily movements. Redundant muscle contractions produce articulated human body
movements. Studying motor coordination is essential to investigate its optimal relationship among multiple-muscle activations.
In muscle coordination studies, the electrical activities of contracted muscles can be measured by electromyography (EMG),
and processed EMG signals are often used to represent muscle
activations [2]. Since EMG is highly correlated with the move-

ment of joints, the joint movement induced by muscle groups
can be analyzed bilaterally: from forward and inverse perspectives. The forward problem consists of determining the resultant
joint torque from the multiple-muscle activations, and in past
decades, several contributions were proposed to establish the
forward relationship between EMG and joint torque [3]–[7]. For
example, Clancy et al. [4], [5] summarized several basic forward
linear and nonlinear models on multiple extension and flexion
EMG signals to estimate elbow joint torque under constant postures. Sinkjaer et al. [6] measured both extension and flexion
muscles to track the ankle joint torque at different contraction
levels. Kent [7] applied the neurogenetic method to establish the
nonlinear mapping from EMG to ankle joint torque. Identifying the forward relationship between EMG and joint movement
can contribute to certain rehabilitation applications, such as the
control of a human-interactive robot [8], prosthetic limbs [9], or
exoskeleton [10], by means of an EMG-driven approach to determine the subject’s mechanical intention regarding the target
motion.
In the domain of neuroprosthetics [11], [12] based on functional electrical stimulation (FES), conversely, the muscle group
activities for the joint movement have to be determined to meet
the desired joint torque, which is formulated as the inverse problem. The inverse problem involves indefinite solutions because
of the inherent muscle redundancy with respect to the associated joints, and there is no bijection between one degree of
freedom (DOF) and the cocontracted muscles spanning around
the joint. The database technique could be applied as a trial
to recover/estimate muscle activity from the motion [13]. For
such an objective, muscle synergy is a useful and insightful
concept to investigate cocontractions and the coordination pattern among them [14]. In a physiological sense, muscle synergy
reveals how the central nervous system (CNS) elicits redundant muscle groups in a coordinated manner. It can be obtained
from multiple-muscle activations via dimension reduction techniques, aiming at diminishing a higher dimensioned signal space
to a lower dimensioned feature space.
In general, most current FES systems activate one agonist
muscle group for each DOF. However, instead of stimulating
only one muscle, it would help to minimize the rapid fatigue that
is a common clinical problem in FES systems if the necessary
force to be managed could be distributed by activating multiple
muscles. To assist the future design of FES systems with distributed control over multiple muscles, information on muscle
synergy could be exploited to naturally follow the way CNS regulates and optimally take advantage of muscle redundancy [15]–
[18]. By extracting muscle synergy information from healthy
subjects and simultaneously measuring the corresponding

kinetics/kinematics, insight into individual muscle’s contribution to the joint flexors/extensors would be obtained. The synergies extracted from healthy subjects, together with their joint
moment data, could then be used to design stimulation patterns
for multiple muscles of incomplete spinal cord injured subjects
who still have remaining volitional contractions of their partially
deficient muscles [18]. The recruitment order in percutaneous
FES is in a nonphysiological manner, which induces muscle
fatigue faster than natural voluntary contractions [19]. Employing multiple redundant muscle activations in FES can promote
reducing fatigue of the stimulated muscles and increasing joint
articulation stability by using the cocontraction of antagonist
muscles [20]. An insightful view of how multiple-muscle activations are coordinated toward the desired joint torque sequence in
able-bodied subjects would help to reduce the time-consuming
empirical FES tuning on paralyzed patients [21]. Thus, the computational inverse estimation of multiple-muscle activations is
of broad interest for FES applications and should help to further
elucidate the underlying physiological processes, which is the
primary motivation for this study.
In our preliminary works [22], [23], an efficient multipleregression-based method was proposed for the inverse estimation of the three muscle activations from ankle joint movement.
Such an approach estimates multiple-muscle activations separately without extracting synergy patterns. However, to further
investigate the natural muscle cocontraction patterns, it may be
necessary to extract the muscle synergy of agonist and antagonist muscle groups under different joint flexions/extentions during both isometric and isotonic contractions. “Isometric” means
that muscle contracts when the joint angle remains unchanged,
and “isotonic” refers to a muscle contraction that is associated
with the change in joint angle (muscle length) with equal tension. The motion under lifting an object is an example of isotonic
contractions, which are often employed in our daily life. In this
paper, we propose a synergy-based framework for inverse estimation of multiple-muscle activations from joint torque. The
method comprises two consequent procedures: muscle synergy
extraction and polynomial model identification between synergy
intensities and joint torque. One could control the joint torque

at different muscle activation levels if there is prior knowledge
of the muscle synergies, which suggests a synergy-assisted estimator for joint torque control by FES as a potential application.
Experimental validation is achieved with ten able-bodied subjects who performed random voluntary contractions around the
ankle joint in isometric and isotonic conditions. This method
successfully provides inverse estimations of the three muscle
activations from the ankle joint, in addition to muscle cocontraction information during plantar and dorsi flexions.
The organization of the work is as follows. The experimental
setup and the approach for inverse estimation of muscle activations are addressed in Section II. The validation results and
discussion are presented in Section III. Detailed discussions are
presented in Section IV. Section V draws the final conclusions.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
The general schematic diagram of the entire inverse estimation process is illustrated in Fig. 1. First, the muscle synergy
and the synergy intensities are extracted through nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF) from multiple-muscle activations.
Second, identification of the model is performed between the
extracted synergy intensities and the corresponding joint movement. For prediction purposes (cross validation), only the joint
torque information (additionally with joint position and velocity
information in nonisometric case) is used to predict the muscle
activations with the identified model.
A. Experimental Setup and Data Processing
The EMG and the joint torque data were acquired from ten
able-bodied subjects (seven males and three females, 28.5 ± 3
years old, 67.5 ± 8.8 kg weight, and 170.7 ± 6.1 cm height) upon
their consent. The study was approved by the ethical committee
for persons’ protection managed by CHRU Montpelier (2011A01033-38), dedicated to the study of the lower limb biomechanics within ANR SoHuSim project. The experiment setup is
shown in Fig. 2. The subjects were seated on a chair with their
right foot attached to a Biodex Dynamometer (Biodex Medical
Systems Inc., Shirley, NY, USA). The setting was 90◦ for the

ankle joint and 110◦ for the knee joint, while the joint center was
aligned with the axis of the dynamometer. Straps were used on
the pelvis and shoulders to secure subjects’ position on the chair.
Thigh movement was also restricted by a strap. The EMG electrodes were placed over the muscle belly of the SOL (Soleus),
MG (Medial Gastrocnemius), and TA (Tibialis) muscles according to the SENIAM recommendation [24] of electrodes
placement based on crus anatomy. The bipolar AgCl EMG electrodes (round with 2-cm radius) were aligned along the direction
of muscle fiber with 20-mm interelectrode spacing. The reference electrode was placed on the patella of the contralateral leg.
The subjects were told to perform maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) in both plantar- and dorsi-flexion directions for
two times. They were then asked to voluntarily make the ankle
plantar-flexion and dorsi-flexion movement randomly including
both directional contractions and both fast-short (1–2 s) and
slow-long (>2 s) contractions. The random session which last
approximately for 2–3 min and contained about 8–20 random
contractions, was repeated two times in isometric and another
two times in isotonic conditions. Synchronous acquisition of the
joint torque and differential EMG signals were performed with a
sample frequency of 2048 Hz by the EMG100c amplifier (gain
1000) and the Biopac MP100 system (Biopac Systems, Inc.,
Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The Biopac EMG100c hardware has
a high-pass filter with a 1-Hz cutoff frequency. After acquisition,
the raw EMG signals were rectified and low-pass filtered with
2-Hz cutoff frequency. Next, the processed EMG signals which
were scaled against the muscles’ own MVC values, respectively,
were normalized to represent the muscle activations U ∈ [01].
The data acquired during each experiment session were divided
into two phases with ratio approximately being 2:3, i.e., one is
the identification (training) phase and the other is the prediction
(testing) phase. Each phase contains a series of fast-short and
slow-long contractions randomly generated by the subject(s).
B. Muscle Synergy Extraction
Consider the multiple-muscle activations uSOL , uM G , and
uTA of the SOL, MG, and TA muscles during the identifica-

It should be noted here that there are two types of articulation
for ankle joint sagittal movement for one DOF: plantar flexion
and dorsi flexion [6], [20]. Therefore, the number of muscle
synergies can be finalized as two for one DOF corresponding to
the flexion and extension of the joint, that is, the dimension of
the reduced resultant subspace is chosen as l = 2 in this study.
C. Identification
Different joint torque levels can be achieved by actuating
different levels of muscle synergy intensities. To do so, identification is first established between the joint torque and the
synergy intensities. In the literature [4], [5], [25], activationto-torque (ui to τ ) forward mapping is described in a general
nonlinear form fi (·), i ∈ {SOL, MG, TA} as

fi (ui ).
τ=
i

It implies that a nonlinear relationship from torque to activations exists. Throughout this paper, we assume that this inverse
relationship can be expressed as the following general nonlinear
form gi (·):
ui = gi (τ ).
According to (2) and the nonlinear relationship above, the activations of the three muscles can be rewritten as

The ability to deal with the redundant muscle combinations
would have practical application in the neuroprosthetic system
control. It is important to know how the multiple-muscle activations should be inversely generated quantitatively to follow the
necessary joint torque sequence (with joint position and velocity
information) depending on the target task, using the individually
identified model.

D. Prediction of Muscle Activations
The parameters G∗1 , . . . , G∗l of the nonlinear model of the
relationship between muscle synergy intensities and joint torque
are determined in the identification phase. During the prediction
phase within the prediction time period [tid + 1, t], only the
forthcoming joint torque information (with joint position and
velocity information) is used to assess the model’s ability to
predict, which serves to cross validate the identified model. The
predicted individual synergy intensities are obtained by

In this section, we present the inverse estimation/prediction
results obtained with the aforementioned approach, based on the
experimental data collected from the ten able-bodied subjects.
In the identification/training phase, the muscle synergies and
intensities are extracted during the identification time period
[0, tid ] through the NMF algorithm. The parameters G∗1 , G∗2 ,
which map ankle joint torque and the synergy intensities, are
then estimated by equation (8). In the prediction/testing phase,
the muscle activations are further predicted with the forthcoming
ankle joint torque information as the sole input. The evaluation
is made under both isometric and isotonic conditions, in order to
present the prediction performances in both static and dynamic
situations.
The muscle synergies for all ten subjects are extracted from
the muscle activation recordings in the corresponding pair of
plantar and dorsi flexions. To quantitatively evaluate each muscle’s contribution to the resultant torque of these plantar and
dorsi flexions, the normalized synergy ratio for each synergy
pair l is defined as follows.

tion of neural command [14], it may indicate that the CNS may
dispatch two different neural commands to control the joint
extension and flexion by, respectively, activating two different
pairs of muscle combinations.
To assess the prediction/testing performance of this synergybased approach, the inverse estimation for multiple-muscle activation is demonstrated by cross validation in the ten subjects.
In our previous works [22], [23], the multiple regression method
was efficient for the inverse estimation of multiple-muscle activations. Multiple-regression analysis is without dimension
reduction. To compare evaluation between the synergy-based
method and the aforementioned multiple regression method,
the prediction results using the multiple regression method [22],
[23] are presented here as well. To assess the global performance
of prediction (cross validation), we define the following rootmean-square errors (RMSEs) and variance (var) accounted for
(VAF) as follows as the performance indexes:

and H 2 from muscle activations U by NMF. Note the random pattern of muscle
activations between the positive torque period and the negative period, which
correspond, respectively, to plantar flexion and dorsi flexion.

Fig. 3 shows the mean values with standard deviations of the
normalized synergy ratios of the ten subjects, with two distinct
types of muscle synergy of the three muscles for the subjects.
Fig. 3(a) shows that SOL is the main agonist muscle conducting plantar flexion of the ankle joint, whereas the Fig. 3(b) shows
that TA is the main agonist muscle for dorsi flexion of the ankle
joint. The cocontractions of agonist and antagonist muscles can
be observed for both directions of flexion. For more detailed
observation, we take Subject V1 as an illustrative example as
shown in Fig. 4. The two synergy intensity (neural command)
vectors H1 and H2 extracted from the muscle activations of
the three muscles correspond to Synergy 1 and 2, respectively.
In Fig. 4, one can intuitively observe that, the positive ankle
joint torque (i.e., plantar-flexion torque) highly correlates with
synergy intensity H1 , and the negative ankle joint torque (i.e.,
dorsi-flexion torque) highly correlates with synergy intensity
H2 . Since the extracted synergy intensity is the direct reflec-

where Ui,m denotes the measured activation vectors of muscle
i, and Nid and Npr are denoted as the sampling numbers during
the identification and prediction phases, respectively.
Fig. 5 illustrates the isometric case for Subject V1. The identification is finished in a time period ranging 0 s to around 47 s,
and from 47 s onward, only the identified model and the forthcoming ankle joint torque information are provided for muscle
activation prediction. In Fig. 5, we see that the predicted muscle
activations of the three muscles fit well with the measured ones
from time instant 47 s to the end. Even when dorsi flexion and
plantar flexion are contained randomly with short (1–2 s) and
long (>2 s) term contractions, the proposed method is able to
produce the resultant multiple-muscle activations from the ankle joint movement with good accuracy. Table I presents a more
detailed investigation, with the RMSEs and VAFs for the muscle activation estimation via the synergy-based method, and the
multiple regression method [22], [23] under the isometric condition. For cross validation of the synergy-based method under
the isometric condition, the RMSE is about 4.03 ± 2.31 and the
VAF is about 82.60 ± 13.25, while for that of the multiple regression method the RMSE is about 4.20 ± 2.60 and the VAF is
about 82.15 ± 15.00. From this comparison, we observe that the
synergy-based method inversely estimates the multiple-muscle
activations successfully as the multiple regression method.
The p-value obtained by similarity analysis through crosscorrelation measure for the errors of the two approaches is less
than 0.05, indicating that they are with high similarity. This
indicates that the synergy-based method possesses the same
estimation quality as the multiple regression method regardless
of dimension reduction after muscle synergy extraction. We also
use these two methods to estimate the three muscle activations
under the isotonic condition. In this situation, the joint position
and velocity are also involved for inverse estimation to take into

account the muscle response changes due to the force-lengthvelocity relationship. Table II shows that the performances of
two methods in the isotonic case are similar, indicating that the
synergy-based method is similar in estimation quality to the multiple regression method under the isotonic condition (p-value
< 0.05 by similarity analysis). In Table II, the values within
parentheses indicate the inverse estimation performance results
without joint position and velocity information, whereas the
values outside the parentheses are with the joint position and
velocity information taken into account. We see that inverse
estimation is improved for both methods by including ankle
joint position and velocity information in the isotonic situation
(i.e., smaller RMSEs and larger VAFs). Although additional
joint position and velocity information could improve the
inverse estimation, no significant statistic difference between
means is observed (p-value > 0.05 by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA)).
Table III shows the leave-one-out cross validation, by which
the average synergy of the other nine subjects is used for
cross validation in the isotonic case to evaluate the intersubject
differences on synergy pattern. Each of the subjects adopted the
other subjects’ normalized average synergy ratios in their own

cross validation, respectively, and from Table III, we observe
that, although the performance tends to be degraded in this
leave-one-out cross validation, the difference in accuracy is not
so large when it is compared to Table II.
IV. DISCUSSION
The proposed framework involves the muscle synergy extraction of multiple-muscle activations for inverse estimation
from joint torque. Within this framework, NMF is applied to
extract muscle synergies from multiple-muscle activations to
obtain the muscle cocontraction patterns corresponding to different levels and directions of joint flexion/extension. In this
study, two synergy patterns are selected to account for the two
types of articulation (plantar and dorsi flexions) for one-DOF
sagittal movement. Similarly, for the flexion and extension of
other joints that mainly focus on one-DOF tasks like the knee
or elbow, two synergy patterns can be used to divide the muscle
groups into flexor and extensor muscles in a systematic manner. The extracted synergy intensity vectors may help to analyze
the individual correlations and the driving impact to the joint
space. Fig. 4 shows that each component of synergy intensity

matrix H can have different levels of correlations with the joint
torque, that is, H1 is highly correlated with the plantar-flexor
joint torque and H2 is highly correlated to the dorsi-flexor joint
torque. This suggests that H1 and H2 may be the dual types of
neural commands inherently delivered by the CNS for potential
control of ankle joint torque. The analysis of synergy intensities
could be further applied to FES to control cocontraction levels
along with the joint torque control for ankle joint movement.
We may stimulate the plantar- and dorsi-flexor muscles simultaneously under different pulsewidth levels to control the ankle
joint torque and the joint stiffness by adjusting the coactivations
of the plantar-flexor and dorsi-flexor actuators.
From Fig. 4, if we intuitively observe the individual muscle
activation (EMG) aspect again, both the SOL and MG activations are highly correlated to the plantar torque. Without synergy
extraction, there is no systematic way to quantitatively evaluate the contribution ratios among the agonist muscles or the
natural cocontraction usage with the antagonist muscles. For this
reason, muscle synergy extraction is essential to the proposed
framework, as individual observation of the muscle activation
may be insufficient for finding the natural correlation between
muscle activations. From the muscle synergies obtained from

71

the ten subjects, as shown in Fig. 3, it appears quantitatively
that SOL muscle is the main agonist muscle during joint plantar
flexion, whereas MG muscle is not. Considering actual activation state of each muscle, fatigue tracking and evaluation were
performed for FES-induced muscle modeling and control [19].
As a future direction toward advanced neuroprosthetics [27],
the information from able-bodied subjects on the muscle synergy that is the inherent physiological motor pattern naturally
assigned by the CNS should be applied to design multimuscle cocontraction-aware FES systems to conduct different joint
flexors and stabilize joint movement.
With regard to estimation performance, the synergy-space
method is as accurate for inversely estimating muscle activations as the multiple regression method [22], [23], as shown in
Tables I and II. In the isotonic condition, we compare the performances with and without information on joint position and
velocity in order to see its impact. Despite no significant difference between the RMSEs (p-value > 0.05 by ANOVA), we
suggest adding joint position and velocity information into the
inverse estimation, given the classic muscle-length and musclevelocity relationship [25]. The estimation without joint angle
and velocity information is still somewhat accurate, but we suspect that this is due to small range of motion of the ankle joint.
Therefore, we assume that joint position and velocity should
normally be taken into account for most joints. The effect might
be larger than the case we presented. Although it would be quite
unrealistic to noninvasively measure the real muscle length and
its velocity, joint position and velocity, which reflect the muscle
length and velocity relationship, can easily be obtained. Indeed,
this assumption is widely used in FES modeling [28]. As we
hope to achieve neuroprosthetic muscle control in the future by
using averaged muscle synergy information, it would be interesting to see whether we can apply the average of the synergy
information obtained from others to a specific subject. Table III
shows the performance results of inverse estimation if we replace subject’s normalized synergy ratio with the average one
from nine other subjects. From the table, we see that the performance is somewhat degraded but acceptable. This implies
that there may be some similarities in muscle synergy patterns
among the able-bodied subjects. It suggests that, we may be
able to apply others’ average synergy patterns to an unknown
subject for neuroprosthetic control purposes by taking advantage of natural and optimal muscle controls from the intact CNS
system. The result in Table III can support the idea of using the
generalized muscle synergy pattern to reproduce natural muscle
combinations in the patient by means of neuroprosthetics. A
recent study [11], in which a patient with complete spinal cord
injury was able to regain some motor functions by application of
electrical stimulation to the spinal cord, has started to attract considerable attention. In their study, they applied machine learning
to help optimally design stimulation patterns. Computer-based
intelligent technologies have the potential to play a more active
role in rehabilitation applications and in promoting the quality
of life for motor-disabled individuals.
The individual relationship between a single muscle and joint
torque is worth investigating from a physiological perspective.
Fig. 6 shows the individual relationships between predicted

activations and torque via the proposed approach (take Subject V1 as an illustrative example). The relationship between
muscle activation and joint torque is nonlinear, as the joint
torque can be mapped nonlinearly to the individual muscles
(SOL, MG, and TA) with polynomial-based models, each with
their associated coefficients. This implies a nonlinear relationship between muscle activation and torque, which is consistent
with the perspectives pointed out in [25]. As shown in Fig. 6,
different cocontraction patterns can occur in plantar flexion and
dorsi flexion of the ankle joint [20]. Within the joint torque
range [0, 50 N · m] SOL and MG act as agonist muscles for
plantar flexion, whereas TA acts as the agonist muscle for dorsi
flexion within joint torque range [−40,0 N · m]. Another interesting finding is that antagonist muscle activation is increased,
when the total agonist muscle activation goes into high level,
probably to stabilize the joint as the joint becomes unstable at
high-contraction state.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a synergy-based computational framework for
the inverse estimation of multiple-muscle activations is proposed and evaluated with experimental analysis. In this first
trial, experimental validation is conducted with the ankle joint
in isometric and isotonic conditions, and the estimation of three
muscle activations (SOL, MG, and TA). The synergies extracted
by NMF helped to reduce the dimension to express the muscle activation patterns, the extracted synergies in ten subjects
indicated both subject specificity and similarity regarding the
multiple muscle activation patterns. The model was cross validated on the prediction of multiple-muscle activations with ten
able-bodied subjects in order to evaluate the performance of this
method. The approach was found to be promising for inverse estimation of the muscle activities expected from joint torque, both
in isometric and isotonic contraction. Regardless of dimension
reduction, the performance was not degraded compared with
the result with the multiple regression. The statistical analysis

showed the significant similarity between methods. This suggests the usefulness of muscle synergy for inverse solutions
as it can keep same prediction performance with natural muscle coordination information and in a reduced dimension space
operation. In addition, the other one’s averaged synergy ratio
was applied for muscle activation estimation with leave-one-out
cross-validation manner, which resulted in 9.3% estimation error over all the subjects. This result supports the common muscle
synergy-based neuroprosthetics control concept.
In future work, we intend to investigate the inverse problem in
the multiple joints situation, with the ultimate aim of achieving
whole-body muscle activity estimation. The extracted information in this situation would be undoubtedly useful for the control
of neuroprosthetic systems. The typical use of multiple muscles
in able-bodied subjects would be reproduced for the artificial
control of the muscles with multichannel FES assisted by the
extracted synergy information. The reproduced cocontractions
would stabilize the joint, similar to the case of the natural motion
employed by CNS.

team at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis Mediterranee and
LIRMM in 2004 after being involved in different European Projects at the
School of Medicine of Montpellier and INSERM Laboratory. For more than ten
years, he was involved in projects and teams working on rehabilitation based
on FES. His research interests include modeling of sensory motor systems, in
particular the striated muscle, designing advanced implantable neuroprostheses
to restore motor functions. He was regularly involved in clinical research activities in close relationship with surgeons and physiotherapists. This leads to the
definition of rehabilitation protocols, but also applied clinical research activities
such as quiet standing for paraplegia, fatigue assessment, movement synthesis,
and control.
