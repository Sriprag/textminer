Brain–Computer Interfaces Using Sensorimotor
Rhythms: Current State and Future Perspectives
Han Yuan, Member, IEEE, and Bin He∗ , Fellow, IEEE

Abstract—Many studies over the past two decades have shown
that people can use brain signals to convey their intent to a computer using brain–computer interfaces (BCIs). BCI systems extract
specific features of brain activity and translate them into control
signals that drive an output. Recently, a category of BCIs that
are built on the rhythmic activity recorded over the sensorimotor
cortex, i.e., the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR), has attracted considerable attention among the BCIs that use noninvasive neural
recordings, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG), and have demonstrated the capability of multidimensional prosthesis control. This
paper reviews the current state and future perspectives of SMRbased BCI and its clinical applications, in particular focusing on
the EEG SMR. The characteristic features of SMR from the human brain are described and their underlying neural sources are
discussed. The functional components of SMR-based BCI, together
with its current clinical applications, are reviewed. Finally, limitations of SMR-BCIs and future outlooks are also discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
VER the last 20 years, neural engineering has emerged
as a new field that merges systems neuroscience and engineering and has resulted in neurotechnology to link brain
activity with man-made devices. Such technology, called the
brain–computer interface (BCI), provides a new output channel
for brain signals to communicate or control external devices
without using neuromuscular pathways [1]–[3]. A BCI recognizes the intent of the user through electrophysiological or other
signals of the brain. In real time, neural recordings are used to
decode ongoing activity and translate into output commands that
accomplish the desire of the user. BCI technology holds promise
of restoring motor ability or communication to people severely
disabled by a wide variety of devastating neuromuscular disorders, and to enhance functions in healthy individuals. Capturing
the intention and communicating with or executing the desired

device form the basis of brain-controlled interface. Motor intention has been naturally adopted mainly for the purpose of
restoring motor control function. In a BCI system, the number
of independent control parameters derived from the brain signals, i.e., the degree of freedom (DOF), is a key attribute and to
a large extent determines the functions that the BCI can execute.
Studies have shown that BCIs can achieve independent multidimensional control, which can be utilized in many rehabilitation
applications, such as modulating environment [75], [93], communication [25]–[27], [31], orthosis control [77], and navigation
in 2-D [78] or 3-D space [19], etc. (see Fig. 1).
Various forms of brain signals have been harnessed to fulfill the goal of movement control. Currently, the three major
recording modalities for BCI are electrophysiological signals
acquired over the scalp [electroencephalography (EEG)], over
the cortical surface [electrocorticography (ECoG)], and within
the brain [single-neuron action potentials (single units) and local
field potentials (LFPs)]. All of these methods record microvoltlevel extracellular potentials generated by neurons in the cortical layers, but they are sampled at different field distances
and at different spatial resolutions. Intracortical recordings of

single neuron action potentials are of the highest resolution
yet represent the most invasive BCI methods since they record
electrical activity from electrodes implanted in the parenchyma.
Research by systems neurophysiologists studying motor systems has uncovered how kinematic parameters of movement
control are encoded in neuronal firing rates [4], [5]. Capitalizing on these neuroscience findings, several groups were
able to develop real-time, closed-loop, BCI systems capable of
multidimensional control [6]–[8]. Initially, these systems were
tested on nonhuman primates [6]–[8], but electrode arrays have
also been implanted in several severely disabled individuals for
multidimensional control of a computer cursor [9], [10] or a
robotic arm [11], [12]. Although invasive BCIs using intracortical recordings (mostly single units) achieve a high level of DOF,
there still remain significant and unresolved questions regarding
the long-term stability of intracortical electrodes, particularly
for recording action potentials from individual neurons [13],
which would significantly limit its clinical applications [14].
LFP is usually acquired in an equally invasive way as single
units yet does not offer the same high signal resolvability as
single units, which is not an optimal solution for real-time BCI
systems. In contrast, EEG is noninvasive and has supported
many important BCI applications, including 2-D and 3-D BCI
control [15]–[19]. Because EEG records the extracellular field
potentials over the scalp, the signal is limited in spatial resolution
(at cm level) and frequency range (mostly below 70 Hz) [20], and
it is more susceptible to environmental interference and other
artifacts like electromyographic signals from cranial muscles or
electrooculographic activity. Nonetheless, EEG is the simplest,
safest recording method and perhaps has the most clinical applications. ECoG signals are recorded from electrodes surgically
placed on the surface of the cortex and are considered less invasive than intracortical recordings as ECoG electrodes do not
penetrate the brain tissue. Compared with EEG, ECoG shares
the same electrophysiological sources with EEG, i.e., the underlying field potentials, but are measured at a closer distance
to the cortex, yielding a finer spatial resolution on the order of
mm as well as the ability to record higher frequency content
in the signal (up to 200 Hz) [21], [22]. Nonetheless, placing
ECoG electrodes still requires surgery and issues such as risk of
tissue damage, infection and long-term recording stability arise.
To date, the ECoG-based BCI systems are only tested in patients with intractable epilepsy who are candidates for invasive
monitoring to localize their seizure foci and to identify eloquent
cortex [22]–[24].
In these studies, a key phenomenon observed across different recording modalities is that the neurophysiological rhythmic
activities recorded over the sensorimotor cortex are modulated
by actual movement, motor intention, or motor imagery. The
modulation manifests as decreases in the alpha (8–13 Hz, also
known as mu rhythm) and beta (14–26 Hz) frequency bands accompanied by increase in the gamma frequency band (>30 Hz),
which is repeatedly observed in EEG, ECoG, LFP as well as
electromagnetic recordings [magnetoencephalography (MEG)].
Such rhythmic brain activities measured by EEG or MEG over
the sensorimotor cortex are collectively referred to as the sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs), which is in general applicable to the

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MAY 2014

counterparts in ECoG and LFP. Motor intention or motor imagery can be decoded from the SMRs, which forms the basis of
neural control in SMR-based BCIs. Studies have demonstrated
that people can learn to increase and decrease the amplitude of
SMR using mental strategy of motor imagery, and thereby control physical or virtual devices (see, e.g., [15], [17], [22], [23],
and [25]–[27]).
SMR-based BCIs have been widely investigated in healthy
human subjects, as well as in people with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) [28] and in those with severe CNS damage
from spinal cord injuries [15] and stroke resulting in substantial
deficits in communication and motor function [29]. By modulating their SMR signals, users were able to acquire 2-D or
3-D movement control [15]–[19], with DOF and performance
comparable to studies using intracortical single units recordings [9], [10]. An example of fine control by EEG SMRs was
demonstrated by He’s research group who showed that human
subjects could fly a model helicopter to any point in a 3-D space
using control of EEG signals recorded from scalp [17]–[19]. In
these studies, subjects were given the opportunity for continuous 2-D or 3-D control to fully explore an unconstrained space;
they learned to fly the helicopter to any target point in the 3-D
space. SMRs are also being utilized in ECoG-based BCIs. So
far the report of highest DOF by ECoG-based BCI (2-D control)
and the only report of 2-D control was built based on using SMR
from the upper arm region of motor cortex for one dimension
and SMR from the hand region for the other dimension [23].
Up to date, in BCIs using EEG or ECoG signals, SMRs offer
the highest level of control in terms of DOF among all other
signal components, such as stimuli evoked potentials and slow
cortical potentials. In addition, SMRs are readily detectable in
healthy as well as disabled individuals by neuromuscular diseases or injuries, including spinal-cord injury, ALS, and stroke.
Over the past decade, SMR-based BCI has been one of the fastest
growing areas. In this paper, we discuss the current state and
future perspectives of SMR-based BCI and its clinical applications, in particular focusing on the EEG SMR. We will describe
the characteristic features of SMR from the human brain and
discuss the electrophysiological sources of SMR. We will also
describe the functional components of SMR-based BCI, review
the current clinical applications, and identify candidate users
and potential applications. Finally, we will discuss current limitations and expectations for the future.

II. CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF SMRS
A. Time–Frequency Modulation of SMRs
EEG as well as ECoG measures the extracellular field potentials associated with neural activity and have been used to study
the basic mechanisms of cortical process. They exhibit endogenous oscillation that is widespread across the entire brain, and
have been found to be related to important aspects of motor
function, sensory perception, or cognition. Task-related modulation in SMRs is usually manifested as amplitude (or power)
decrease in the low-frequency components (alpha/beta band),
also known as event-related desynchronization (ERD) [30]. In

YUAN AND HE: BRAIN–COMPUTER INTERFACES USING SENSORIMOTOR RHYTHMS: CURRENT STATE AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

contrast, an amplitude increase in a frequency band is known as
event-related synchronization (ERS) [30].
Planning and execution of movement has been found to
lead to predictable decreases in the alpha and beta frequency
bands [30]. Also, many studies have demonstrated that motor
imagery can cause ERD (and often ERS) in primary sensorimotor areas [30]–[34]. Discriminant information can be extracted from the spatial patterns of sensorimotor rhythmic modulations [33], [35]–[38]. More importantly, the modulation of
alpha- and beta-band SMR have been found to be organized in a
somatotopic manner. Source imaging studies of SMR [39], [40]
have revealed that movement or motor imagery of different body
parts were associated with decrease in SMR from regions along
the primary sensorimotor cortex corresponding to different body
parts, known as the Homunculus. Such characteristic changes
in EEG SMRs can be used to classify brain states relating to the
planning/imagining of different types of limb movement, which
forms the basis of neural control in SMR-based BCIs [27], [41].
The findings of EEG SMR modulations have basically been
corroborated in ECoG studies. Motor actions, as well as motor
imagery, are usually associated with a decrease in alpha- and
beta-band spectral amplitude across the corresponding area of
motor cortex [42]. In addition, as ECoG more readily detects
activity in the higher frequency band, many ECoG studies have
demonstrated that spatially focused gamma activity (40–200 Hz)
correlates closely with specific aspects of motor, language, or
cognitive function [43], [44]. In particular, increase of amplitude
in the gamma-band activity has been found to accompany the
decrease in alpha and beta frequency bands during motor execution, motor imagery, and imagery-based online feedback [34].
Notably, the gamma-band SMR tends to be more spatially focused than the low-frequency activities [34], [44].
In addition to modulation in the alpha/beta/gamma frequency bands, SMR signals in the very low frequency band
(<1 Hz) have also been explored for studying the kinematic
information. Researchers have been able to decode 2-D and
3-D velocity of hand movement from the very low frequency
SMRs [45]–[47]. Online BCI systems based on such slow SMR
have been demonstrated to allow users to acquire 2-D movement control with a relatively short training time [48]. Interestingly, similar counterparts of very low frequency oscillations
in ECoG, referred to as local motor potentials, have also been
found to show close correlation with hand and finger kinematics
[49].
In addition to amplitude- and time-domain features, several
recent studies have also begun to explore the cross-frequency
coupling in SMR. It has been demonstrated that gamma activity
is modulated by the phase of low-frequency brain rhythms (e.g.,
in the theta, mu, and beta ranges) [50], [51]. To what extent
these coupling mechanisms could be useful in a BCI context
remains unclear.
In summary, SMR can detect several physiological processes
and their interactions within and across sites. SMR in a wide
range of frequency bands contains substantial and complementary information on motor function. Kinematic information of
motor control as well as motor imagery is found to be distributedly encoded in SMR from the cerebral cortex. Through

feature extraction for SMRs [33]. It is difficult to detect a coherent component
in the raw EEG signal depicted in the top frame because there is a lot of noise
in the signal. The second frame shows the signal after being processed through
a surface Laplacian filter that focuses on EEG components in a specific spatial
frequency range. As shown in the third frame, the signal is then bandpass
filtered to isolate the frequencies of interest. The features become evident in the
fourth frame as they are extracted by using a grand averaging method over a
fixed bin or window size. (b) An example of the TFR of SMR dynamics [33].

decoding, such functional neurophysiological information can
be and has in part been used for BCI control.
B. Electrophysiological Sources of SMRs
The endogenous oscillations in the lower frequencies occurring continually during idling or resting state are thought to
be generated by complex thalamocortical networks of neurons
that create feedback loops [52]. Alpha rhythms recorded in the
human brain at resting state have been found to be correlated
with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals at the primary visual
cortex as well as the thalamus [53], [54], corroborating the thalamocortical origins for the endogenous rhythms. Furthermore,
source analysis studies have shown that the electrophysiological
sources for the idling or resting-state alpha rhythms are located
in the primary visual cortex [55], [56].
During nonidling periods, however, these oscillations change
in amplitude and/or frequency, and these changes are evident
in the EEG or MEG. The sources of SMRs induced by movements or imagined movements of various body parts have been
located in the primary sensorimotor cortex in a somatotopic
manner [39]. They are also found to be colocalized with fMRI
activations following the somatotopic organization, as shown
in Fig. 2(c). In addition, the amplitudes of SMR decreases are
found proportional to the amplitudes of positive BOLD fMRI responses [40], [57] but not to the negative BOLD responses [40].
Furthermore, the temporal modulations of SMRs are correlated
with the BOLD fMRI, primarily in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex [40], [58]. These findings suggest that there is

1428

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MAY 2014

tight coupling between SMR and BOLD fMRI, suggesting the
spectral-spatial encoding of SMR over the cortex.
In contrast to the lower frequencies, gamma activity has been
shown to be strongly correlated with the firing rate of individual
neurons and has also been closely linked to the BOLD signals detected by fMRI, which has been observed in LFPs [59],
ECoG [60], MEG [61], and EEG [62]. Many studies have colocalized the simultaneous decrease in alpha/beta frequency bands
and increase in gamma band induced by movement and motor imagery [34], [42]–[44]. These findings suggest that common neuronal events, likely neural activation, underlie the taskrelated hemodynamic response and multiband SMR responses.
Nonetheless, the exact mechanism of SMR modulations remains
elusive. For example, it is unclear to what extent the amplitude
of SMR modulations depends on the respective contributions of
neuronal firing rates and synaptic potentials, and of their relative phases. Better understanding of the mechanism of SMRs,
including their generation and modulation, would provide more
informative features of SMR, which in turn can be used for
decoding in SMR-based BCI.
III. CURRENT BCIS USING SMRS
A. Signal Acquisition
EEG signals can be noninvasively measured using commercially available amplifier systems with electrodes positioned in
elastic caps according to international standards. More recently,
the more user-friendly electrodes, such as dry, capacitancebased electrodes, have also been developed which could reduce
the demands on BCI-users for long-term usability [63], [64].
For targeting low-frequency SMRs other than gamma band activity, a typical sampling frequency of 200 or 100 Hz would suit
the needs. Otherwise, a higher sampling frequency would be
required to satisfy Shannon’s sampling theorem if the gamma
band activity is intended.
B. Feature Extraction
In order to define the neural modulation of SMR, the
EEG signals are usually subjected to time/frequency analysis.
Frequency-based features have been widely used in SMR-based
BCIs because of their ease of application, computational efficiency, and straightforward interpretation. Because these features do not provide time-domain information, they are not sensitive to the nonstationary nature of EEG SMR. Thus, mixed
time–frequency representations (TFRs) that map a 1-D signal
into a 2-D function of time and frequency are used to extract the
time-varying spectral content of the signals [65], [68]. Parametric approaches are also commonly used to estimate the
time/frequency features, such as autoregressive (AR) modeling for stationary signals and adaptive AR modeling for nonstationary signals [85], [90], which are widely implemented in
online BCI systems due to their computational efficiency [119].
However, it is worth noting that such parametric modeling approaches usually require predetermined parameters, such as the
model order, which can influence BCI performance [90].

In order to extract discriminant information in SMR modulations, defining features by spatial location is as important
as defining them by temporal/spectral characteristics, as the
spatial resolution and specificity of EEG/MEG signal is relatively low and the acquired signal usually reflects activity in
large regions of the brain. Thus, in order to optimize the spatial information, the channels used for BCI control are usually
a selected subset of a few channels. These can be selected by
comparing discriminative features [17], by subspace decomposition method [120], [122], or based on a priori knowledge of the
functional organization of the relevant cortical area(s) [27], [39].
In addition, methods are developed to integrate the spatial
and time/frequency features for quantifying the SMR modulations. He and his colleagues have developed methods to
extract the so-called time–frequency synthesized spatial patterns [33], [35], [36], as shown in Fig. 2(b). In these methods,
the EEG signals are decomposed into a series of frequency
bands, and the instantaneous power is represented by the envelope of oscillatory activity, which forms the spatial patterns
for a given electrode montage at a time–frequency grid. Time–
frequency weights determined by training process are used to
synthesize the contributions from the time–frequency domains.
In this space-time–frequency synthesis approach, individual differences are accommodated; it does not contain a priori subjectdependent parameters and is computationally efficient, thus
making it suitable for robust online classification.
Recently, electrophysiological source imaging methods have
also been proposed as a spatial deconvolution approach to extracting spatial information about the features used in a BCI
[27], [65]–[67]. He and colleagues proposed to use such EEGbased source signals to classify motor imagery states for BCI
purposes [68]. Several groups have reported promising results
from source analyses as compared to results from the scalp EEG
data [27], [66], [67], [69]–[71]. The use of source estimation in
BCI applications involves increased computational cost due to
the need to solve the inverse problem. On the other hand, such
source analysis transforms signals from sensor space back to
source space with improved spatial resolution and specificity,
and may lead to enhanced performance for SMR-based BCI.
Numerous studies on EEG source imaging have demonstrated
substantially enhanced spatial resolution and resolvability of
brain processes in both healthy subjects and subjects with brain
disorders (for a review, see [72] and [73]). Based on the colocalization between SMRs and fMRI activations, information from
complementary imaging techniques such as fMRI can help determine potential target areas for a specific subject [39]. FMRI
measurement of the BOLD response has facilitated determination of cortical areas useful for recording of brain activity
and has also been shown to provide reliable BCI control across
several cortical areas using different cognitive tasks [74].
C. Feature Translation and Effector
Translation techniques are algorithms developed with the goal
of converting the input features (dependent variable) into device control commands (independent variables) that achieve
the user’s intent [75]. Ideally, the translation algorithm will

YUAN AND HE: BRAIN–COMPUTER INTERFACES USING SENSORIMOTOR RHYTHMS: CURRENT STATE AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

convert the chosen features into output commands that achieve
the user’s intent accurately and reliably. Furthermore, an effective translation algorithm will adapt so as to adjust for
spontaneous changes in the features and will also encourage
and facilitate the user’s acquisition of better control over the
features.
Thus far there are two major types of translation: continuous and discrete. In continuous feature translation, consecutive
output commands are generated continually based on the features. Examples of this translation are the kinematic parameters
(e.g., arm position, velocity, etc.) that control a prosthetic arm.
The features are usually derived from short-time windowed signals and are then continuously fed into the translation algorithm
so that dynamic outcomes are obtained for BCI control [119].
Continuous translation allows the users to adjust their strategies
in the course of control, which can result in very fine movement control but can also be more mentally demanding on the
users. Discrete feature translation produces periodic commands
at fixed intervals. An example of this type of translation is a BCI
that classifies the mental states of various types of motor imageries [41]. Thus, it is particularly suited for applications such
as word-processing, which requires discrete selections, and less
suited for applications such as multidimensional robotic arm
control, which is best implemented by a continuous series of
output commands.
The outputs of translation are commands to operate an external device. As illustration in Fig. 1, the output might be used
to operate a spelling program on a computer screen through
letter selection [76], to move a cursor on a computer screen
[25]–[27], [31], to manipulate a robotic arm [77], to drive a
wheelchair [78], to control a functional electrical stimulation
device [79], or even to control a flying robot in the 3-D physical
space [19]. At present, the most commonly used output device
is the computer screen, and it is used for communication.
D. SMR-Based BCI Systems
Over the past decades, the SMR-based BCI applications have
come a long way from the very beginning of a 1-D “Ping-Pong”like game [25], [80] to the state of the art, a computer cursor [16]
or virtual helicopter [17], [18] in the 3-D virtual world, or even
an unmanned helicopter in the real world [19], all controlled by
thoughts alone (see Fig. 3).
Early work by Pfurtscheller and coworkers has developed
BCI systems that used mu-rhythm EEG recordings measured
over sensorimotor cortex [77], [80]–[84]. The raw EEG signals
were filtered to yield the mu band (8–12 Hz) and then squared to
estimate the instantaneous mu power. Alternatively, the power
modulation can be extracted using adaptive AR models [85].
The spectral [86] and spatial features [81], [87] of SMR have
been extensively studied, and can be used for classifying the
states of motor imageries, e.g. left hand versus right hand, using
various pattern classification techniques [88], [121]. The outputs of classification can be quantified and translated into the
executive functions of BCI applications. More degrees of independent control can be achieved by classifying multiple mental
states of imageries [41], [89].

1429

(c) 3-D control of cursor movement, or (d) navigate in the 3-D space, adapted
from [16] and [19] with permission.

Another approach of using the SMRs is to allow continuous
control through linear combination of SMRs, instead of discrete
pattern classifications. Wolpaw and coworkers developed BCI
system that allows users to control to move a computer cursor
in 1-D [25], 2-D [15], [26], [90], or 3-D [16], and many other
applications [91]–[93] based on linear combination of SMRs.
The EEG is recorded as the users actively controlled mu and/or
beta rhythm power (amplitude squared) at one or several specific
electrode locations over sensorimotor cortex. The EEG power
spectra are calculated by an AR method to generate the feature
vector [15], [90], [94]. This methodology provides multidimensional control that is comparable in speed and accuracy to that
achieved to date in humans with microelectrodes implanted in
cortex [15], [16].
More recently, highly dexterous control by SMR-based BCIs
for continuous navigation in a virtual or real 3-D world has been
demonstrated by He et al. [17]–[19]. Control signals were derived from motor imagery tasks and intelligent control strategies
were used to improve the performance of navigation. By using
a constant forward flying velocity, 3-D navigation was reduced
to 2-D navigation, which allowed human subjects to fly a virtual
helicopter to any point in the 3-D space [17]. Further studies
have enabled human subjects to perform fast, accurate, and continuous control of a virtual helicopter in 3-D space [17], [18] or
quadcopter in a 3-D physical space [19], as shown in Fig. 3(d).
In these BCI systems, the helicopter’s forward-backward translation and elevation controls were actuated through the modulation of SMRs that were converted to forces applied to the
helicopter at every simulation time step, and the helicopter’s
angle of left or right rotation was linearly mapped, with higher
resolution, from SMRs associated with other motor imaginations. These different resolutions of control allow for interplay
between general intent actuation and fine control as is seen in
the gross and fine movements of the arm and hand. Subjects
controlled the helicopter with the goal of flying through rings
(targets) randomly positioned and oriented in a 3-D space. Such
work suggests the potential of noninvasive EEG-based BCI systems to accomplish complex control in freely exploring and
interacting with the world, which is a crucial element of autonomy that is lost in the context of neurodegenerative disease.

1430

E. Clinical Applications
The most important clinical application for SMR-based BCI
is to restore or replace the lost motor function [1]–[3]. It has
been demonstrated in patients disabled by injuries or diseases.
Thus, via the use of BCI, someone who cannot speak could
use a BCI to spell words that are then spoken by a speech
synthesizer. Or one who has lost limb control could use a BCI
to operate a powered wheelchair. Someone with a spinal cord
injury whose arms and hands are paralyzed could use a BCI
to control stimulation of the paralyzed muscles with implanted
electrodes so that the muscles move the limbs. Or one who has
lost bladder function from multiple sclerosis could use a BCI to
stimulate the peripheral nerves controlling the bladder so as to
produce urination.
Other than the application of restoring or replacing movement related functions, BCI, specifically SMR-based BCI, has
received increasing attention for rehabilitation purpose by improving natural output of central neural system. For example,
a person whose arm movements have been compromised by a
stroke damaging sensorimotor cortex might employ a BCI that
measures signals from the damaged areas and then excites muscles or controls an orthosis that improves arm movement. A
recent pilot study using virtual hands showed promise in stroke
patients for rehabilitation [116]. Because this BCI application
enables the production of more normal movements, its continued use might induce activity-dependent CNS plasticity that
improves the natural CNS output and thus helps to restore more
normal arm control.
Many studies have shown that training for and using BCIs
can lead to changes in neural activity that facilitate use of prosthetic devices, especially when combined with functional electric stimulation (FES) [95], [96]. Such learning-related changes
are especially important for people with brain injuries, such as
those who have suffered strokes. In a study using MEG recordings, patients with chronic hand hemiplegia after stroke successfully learned to use motor imagery to control their SMRs,
and they were able to use a BCI to control an orthotic device
that opened and closed their paralyzed hands [29]. Over a period of three weeks, subjects’ performances steadily improved
as they learned to use the device. Comparison between the early
and late training stages revealed enhanced SMRs in the ipsilesional hemisphere, which was the hemisphere used to control
the device. Several randomized controlled studies have indicated that assisting movement with FES coupled to BCI use can
substantially improve upper-limb function in individuals who
have been mildly to moderately [97] or severely [98] impaired
by stroke. Studies with both invasive and noninvasive BCIs also
indicate that learning-related changes can occur over days to
months [99]. Interestingly, once users have learned to operate
a neuroprosthesis with a BCI they retain this skill months later
without intervening use [15], suggesting a long-term learningrelated change in neural circuits. Thus, BCIs might be used to
help actually restore motor function by promoting beneficial
neuroplasticity in neuromuscular pathways.
It is worthwhile to point out that other than clinical applications, there are also nonmedical applications of SMR-based

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MAY 2014

BCIs. For example, the cursor movement [15], virtual helicopter
control [17], [18], and real helicopter control [19] are not directly related to a clinical application, albeit with potential for
clinical application. Other applications include those for entertainment purpose [118], which, however, is not the focus of this
review.
IV. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND AREAS FOR FUTURE
RESEARCH
A. Towards a Kinematic BCI
Motor imagery has been the most widely employed mental
strategy to solicit SMR modulation in SMR-based BCI. Many
noninvasive BCI systems using EEG or MEG signal have been
built based on classification of different mental states. In these
systems, typically imagination of a certain body movement, e.g.,
imagination of moving left hand or right hand, corresponds to
one mental state that will be translated into one direction of control, and four independent mental states are generally required
for full 2-D control, which is also utilized in BCI systems using
ECoG [22], [23] and in some studies using intracranial recordings in human brain [9]. Therefore, this strategy requires users
to develop the skill to maintain and manipulate various mental
states to enable the control throughout each attempt (usually
more than a few seconds). The mental load of maintaining and
manipulating various motor imagery can be quite demanding,
especially in disabled users [77], and a substantial period of
training is typically needed for users to develop such kind of
skill to control their SMRs [15], [99].
One approach toward addressing this challenge for SMRbased BCI is to build a BCI by decoding kinematic movement
parameters, which is commonly utilized in BCI/brain–machine
interface (BMI) systems using intracranial recordings. Notably
different from many SMR-based BCIs, BCI/BMI studies using single unit activity from intracranial recordings have been
focusing on decoding kinematic parameters associated with motor control and directly apply those for prosthetic manipulation.
Kinematic parameters that have been decoded include the position, direction, speed, and acceleration of the arm or wrist movements [100]. Many of these parameters have been implemented
for real-time neural decoding to achieve multidimensional, dexterous control [6]–[8].
More recently, capitalizing by the findings of systems neurophysiology, investigators began to examine how the kinematic
information related to movement or motor imagery are represented from nonspiking neural recordings, including LFP [101],
ECoG [49], EEG [46], [57], and MEG [46], [47], [102]. Several
studies have reported success in decoding information about
the (imagined) movement direction and speed from the spatiotemporal profiles of EEG signals [40], [46], [47], [57], [102].
Interestingly, linear models are commonly utilized and have
succeeded in explaining the relationship between kinematic parameters and electrophysiological features. For example, studies have revealed that the speeding of arm movement can be
modeled as a continuous gain factor in the linear encoding
model [8], [103]. Yuan et al. has also found a consistent speed
encoding model in the EEG SMRs where the speed acts as

YUAN AND HE: BRAIN–COMPUTER INTERFACES USING SENSORIMOTOR RHYTHMS: CURRENT STATE AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

multiplicative gain factor. Although the type of hand movement
was different (clenching versus reaching), the study suggested
that speed can be a common gain factor to the cortical recordings
at both microscale and macroscale levels across various hand
tasks, even including motor imageries. Such investigations focusing on kinematic decoding in SMR can lead to the future of
kinematic, finely-controlled, multidimensional and fast-attained
BCI control [18], [19], [48], [57].
B. Toward a Versatile BCI
As discussed above, most previous SMR-based BCI studies
have been focused on motor imagery of large body part, e.g.,
upper or lower limb. In order to further advance the SMR-based
BCIs, recent studies have begun to explore whether or how complicated dexterous movement, such as individual finger movement, multiple hand postures/synergies, can be decoded from
SMRs, other than from neural spiking activity. Studies using single unit recordings [104], [123] or functional MRI [105] have
shown that while a relative large portion of the sensorimotor
cortex is associated with dexterous movement of finger or joint,
and that organization of such fine movement is highly spatial
specific and tends to be mixed and overlapping. This is encouraging for researchers to attempt decoding fine movements of
the finger/hand in more macroscale neural recordings, because
finger/hand representations are more spread out in the cortex
than, for example, upper arm muscles, even though the signal
resolvability would be compromised. Indeed, several studies
have achieved notable success in decoding individual movement based on ECoG recordings. Interestingly, Miller et al.
showed that the most discriminative feature for individual finger
encoding is the broadband modulation of SMRs [108], which
corroborates another finding that the broadband modulation of
SMR in LFP is tightly coupled to the underlying neuronal action
potentials [117]. Meanwhile, studies using EEG have also reported certain success in decoding individual fingers, and even
imagined individual finger movement [106], [107], from the
scalp recorded SMRs. In their studies phenomena of broadband
power increase and low-frequency-band power decrease were
observed in EEG. These movement-related spectral structures
and their changes caused by finger movements in EEG are consistent with observations from ECoG recordings [107]–[109].
The average decoding accuracy of 77.11% was obtained from
EEG in classifying each pair of fingers [107], whereas the average decoding accuracy using ECoG data was 91.28% [107].
These findings again demonstrate the common electrophysiological phenomenon across different recording modalities and
suggest their common sources for the SMRs. These findings also
suggest the future generation of a more versatile SMR-based
BCI that can achieve complex, dexterous prosthetic control.
C. Toward a Hybrid BCI
As mentioned above, it takes substantial training and effort
for users to develop the SMR skill for multidimensional control,
which may discourages the users by fatigue and mental loads,
especially in the disabled users. Nonetheless, it has been shown
that it is relative easy and robust for many users to develop

1431

reasonable 1-D control by motor imagery with relatively little
training [99], which would offer the advantage of SMR-based
control, such as continuous, accurate and can be of both direction and speed control. Such advantage makes SMR-based BCI
especially suitable for candidate of a hybrid BCI [110], which
is composed of more than one BCI. Hybrid BCIs can either
process their inputs simultaneously, or operate two systems sequentially, where the first system can act as a “brain switch.”
Hybrid BCIs are proposed to combine the advantage of individual component BCI and therefore offer joint and perhaps better
usability. So far many of the reported hybrid BCIs have at least
one of them is the SMR-based BCI. By combining the SMRBCI with a BCI based on another type of brain signal, the hybrid
BCI is reported to offer the highest classification accuracy than
any of its individual component alone [110]. Moreover, a multidimensional (2-D) BCI can be achieved by combining a 1-D
SMR-based BCI with another BCI based on SSVEP [111] or
P300 [112], with comparable performance to that reported in a
purely SMR-based 2-D control [15]. Importantly, since only one
dimension of control is required for SMR-BCI and the other is
based on another type of EEG signal that requires little training
for modulation, the total training is substantially reduced compared to an SMR-based 2-D BCI. This avenue of research in
hybrid BCI would greatly extend the possibility of clinical and
practical usage for SMR-based BCI systems.
D. Learning and Rehabilitation
It is now widely recognized that training is essential for using
SMR-based BCI systems and substantial training can lead to improvement in the skill of modulating SMRs [1]–[3]. However,
there are still important questions about the basic mechanism of
SMR learning. Little is known about how the brain instantiates
SMR-based BCI control and the accompanying plastic changes
in motor cortical areas. Answers to the question of SMR learning will also bear significant importance to further the clinical
application of SMR-BCI in rehabilitation.
Notable progress has been made recently in investigating the
mechanism of learning in SMR-BCI, by using multimodal imaging approach. Pichiorri et al. [113] has combined transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) mapping and EEG connectivity
imaging to assess if and how SMR-based BCI training would
induce persistent functional changes in motor cortex. A group
of naı̈ve participants learned to use SMR-based BCI in a series
of sessions and TMS mapping was applied before and after their
training. When TMS was applied, peak amplitude and volume
of the motor evoked potentials recorded from the opponens pollicis muscle were significantly higher only in those subjects who
develop an MI strategy based on imagination of hand grasping
to successfully control a computer cursor. Their results demonstrated that SMR-based BCI training led to a significant increase
in motor cortical excitability. Their findings are also corroborated in a recent study that combined SMR-BCI and TMS in
a closed-loop stimulation design [114], in which TMS was applied to the right hand M1 when the motor-imagery-associated
decrease of SMR magnitude exceeded predetermined thresholds
during online BCI feedback. Their results showed that the large

1432

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MAY 2014

ERD during wrist motor imagery was associated with significantly increased MEP amplitudes. These studies provide electrophysiological evidence that ERD magnitude during motor
imagery represents M1 excitability and SMR learning enhances
the excitability. The finding that a motor imagery task involving
ERD may induce changes in corticospinal excitability similar to
changes accompanying actual movements has important clinical implications. It suggests the important merit of motor imagery and motor-imagery-based BCI in rehabilitation, e.g., in the
stroke patients. In this regard, a recent study [124] compared the
rehabilitation effects of upper-extremity robot-assisted rehabilitation versus an EEG-based brain computer interface setup with
motor imagery (i.e., SMR-based BCI) in hemiparetic patients
after stroke. The pre- and post-treatment assessments including
Fugl-Meyer upper-extremity motor score and resting-state fMRI
showed that patients with SMR-BCI rehabilitation obtained
as good performance (even numerically higher) as those with
the traditional physical robot-assisted rehabilitation. After BCI
training, increased functional connectivity was observed in the
supplementary motor area, the contralesional and ipsilesional
motor cortex, and parts of the visuospatial system with mostly
association cortex regions and the cerebellum, which were correlated with individual upper-extremity function improvement.
These network changes corroborate with neuroimaging observations of the SMR during online feedback [27], [34]. Such
initial evidence strongly encourages the usage of SMR-BCI in
clinical rehabilitation applications [115].
V. SUMMARY
Among various strategies for EEG-based BCI, SMRs have
thus far offered control of the highest degrees of freedom and
demonstrated a versatile spectrum of useful applications. Future research is needed in areas including: 1) developing better
methods to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of SMR
modulations; 2) decoding more information from SMR based on
better understanding of the mechanisms of SMR modulations;
and 3) developing BCI applications that provide multidimensional and high-performance neuroprosthetic control to allow
individuals in needs to perform activities of daily living.
