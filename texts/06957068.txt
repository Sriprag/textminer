Big Heart Data: Advancing Health Informatics
Through Data Sharing in Cardiovascular Imaging
Avan Suinesiaputra, Pau Medrano-Gracia, Brett R. Cowan, and Alistair A. Young

Abstract—The burden of heart disease is rapidly worsening due
to the increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes. Data sharing
and open database resources for heart health informatics are important for advancing our understanding of cardiovascular function, disease progression and therapeutics. Data sharing enables
valuable information, often obtained at considerable expense and
effort, to be reused beyond the specific objectives of the original
study. Many government funding agencies and journal publishers
are requiring data reuse, and are providing mechanisms for data
curation and archival. Tools and infrastructure are available to
archive anonymous data from a wide range of studies, from descriptive epidemiological data to gigabytes of imaging data. Metaanalyses can be performed to combine raw data from disparate
studies to obtain unique comparisons or to enhance statistical
power. Open benchmark datasets are invaluable for validating data
analysis algorithms and objectively comparing results. This review
provides a rationale for increased data sharing and surveys recent progress in the cardiovascular domain. We also highlight the
potential of recent large cardiovascular epidemiological studies
enabling collaborative efforts to facilitate data sharing, algorithms
benchmarking, disease modeling and statistical atlases.
Index Terms—Anatomical models, cardiac atlas, cardiac MRI,

I. INTRODUCTION
ARDIOVASCULAR disease (CVD) is the world’s leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Healthcare costs
from CVD are rising due to the increasing prevalence of obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The results of the global
burden of disease study show that ischemic heart disease was
the leading cause of disability-adjusted life years in 2010 [1].
In many countries, obesity is likely to overtake tobacco as the
leading risk to health by 2016 [2].
The ability to integrate data from multiple sources and across
many variables has significant potential for the evaluation and
treatment of patients. These methods enable deeper characterization of a particular patient, and more precise mapping
to similar patients in pertinent subpopulations [3]. Efficient
characterization of subpopulations requires data harmonization,
new analytical algorithms and analysis of heterogeneous
data. This approach relies on data sharing infrastructure and
high-throughput database resources in large epidemiological

studies as well as in small experimental studies, which would
otherwise require a large cost or effort to reproduce.
Data sharing for scientific advancement is well established
in many fields. In genomics, databases have existed for many
years for archiving and curating data [4]. In neuroscience, large
repositories are available for specific disease groups or general
atlases [5]. Efforts are now being made to facilitate data sharing in the cardiovascular domain [6]. This review highlights the
rationale and the need for data sharing in the cardiovascular
research community, and outlines current efforts to provide infrastructure and tools for data sharing. Examples are given by
atlas-based analysis of cardiac remodeling and ongoing community efforts to establish benchmarking platforms for cardiac
image analysis.
II. LARGE-SCALE CARDIOVASCULAR POPULATION STUDIES
A large part of our current understanding of multivariable
risk factors in the etiology of CVD arose from the Framingham
heart study, which began in 1948 and is still continuing with
over 1200 publications. The Framingham scores assess cardiovascular risk factors of hypertension, smoking, lipid profile,
obesity, diabetes and inactivity; the pathophysiological progression from hypertension to heart failure; the relationship between atrial fibrillation and stroke; and the value of populationbased longitudinal studies [7]. With the advent of large-scale
databases and data mining methods, it has recently become possible to identify relationships across many different types of
information [8].
A wealth of data is now available from noninvasive cardiac
imaging examinations. Prospective longitudinal studies derived
from large-scale imaging data have been established to investigate the pathogenesis of cardiac diseases [9], [10]. Longitudinal
studies, which follow patients over time, enable scientists to
understand the evolution of cardiac disease from subclinical
manifestations to clinical symptoms. The combination of imaging data with other diagnostic information and biomarkers gives
a new rich field of big heart data (defined for the purposes of
this review as imaging studies combined with clinical assessments in large study cohorts on an unprecedented scale). These
present significant opportunities for new discoveries to reduce
the burden of CVD.
Table I lists existing large-scale cardiovascular studies with
collection of gigabytes of imaging data. The Multi-Ethnic Study
of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study was initiated in 2000 to focus
on the manifestation of subclinical to clinical CVD before signs
and symptoms develop in the heterogeneous population of the
US [11]. The study has sampled 6814 men and women aged 45–
84 years old across six centers. The analysis of the ten

year follow-up has recently been completed for around 3000
participants [17]. The MESA study was the first major
population-based study to use cardiac MRI [18]. Data sharing
is provided by the MESA study through their ancillary studies
and publication protocols.
The UK biobank [9] is an extensive collection of cardiac data,
including questionnaires, physical examinations and biological
samples, from 500 000 men and women aged 40–69 in 22 centers across the UK. An imaging enhancement substudy began
in April 2014 with the aim of imaging 6000 participants during
the pilot phase. If successful, 100 000 participants will be imaged with MRI over a 5–6 year period, which will be the largest
prospective cardiac imaging dataset worldwide. Imaging modalities include cardiac MRI, abdominal MRI, brain MRI, carotid
ultrasound, and DEXA.
The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) was designed to determine
the root causes of CVD in 5302 African–American individuals aged 21–84 years living in the southeastern USA (Jackson,
Mississippi) [12], [19], [20]. This group experiences increased
mortality from CVD as well as higher incidence of hypertension,
obesity and diabetes. A unique aspect of JHS was the association
of neighborhood disadvantages in terms of economic, sociocultural, behavioral, dietary and physical activity measures with
cardiometabolic risk factors [21], [22]. The JHS provides a rare
insight into the interactions between genotype and phenotype
in a high-risk population. In terms of imaging data, the JHS
has collected 3000 CT and MRI examinations containing heart
function and calcium scores [23].
Other studies such as the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow
Project (CPTP) with 10 000 participants, ICELAND MI with
936 patients with myocardial infarction, and the Framingham
Offspring Study with 1707 follow-up cardiac MRI scans added
more imaging data for cardiac research. While not a study per
se, the EuroCMR registry has the main goal to evaluate the prognostic potential of cardiac MRI as well as its cost-effectiveness.
More than 27 000 consecutive patients have been enrolled from
57 centers in 15 countries. Similarly, the global CMR registry
has been established to collate MRI patient data from around
the world with 44 000 cases contributed to date.

and user. The data contributor controls the acceptance of user request, while
the organizer manages, stores and also enriches the original clinical data with
derived analyses. This figure was adapted from [6].

III. SHARING MEDICAL DATA
With the ability to mine multidimensional relationships in
diverse datasets, sharing patient medical records across clinical
providers and researchers becomes a key factor to improve quality of care, to reduce healthcare costs and to minimize human errors [24]. However, sharing medical data remains a big challenge
due to the extremely granular nature of healthcare data. Hospitals, imaging centers, healthcare institutions and clinics must enforce strict guidelines to uphold patient data privacy and security.
Therefore, central to enable medical data sharing is a secured
protection of patient data, such as mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the US or
the Data Protection Act (DPA) in the UK. Ensuring patient data
privacy is essential before sharing medical records to a wider
community.
In general, there are three entities in data sharing: data contributors, organizers and users (see Fig. 1). The data contributor
is a provider who wants to release their data to a wider research
community without breaching agreements with patients and
other clinical interests. Data contributors must ensure informed
consent is obtained, which is compatible with data sharing, in
conjunction with local ethics committee or institutional review
board (IRB) approval. They can only contribute anonymized
or deidentified data. The deidentification process removes any
health information that can be used to identify an individual,
e.g., name, dates (except for year), social security, location or
other unique identifiers. These can be stored in the metadata,
concealed as filename, or even hidden in clinical narratives [25].
Several automated deidentification algorithms are available (see
a survey in [26]).
To ensure that IRB and data distribution criteria are met, data
contributors are usually involved in the approval of data use applications. Alternatively, data contributors can approve specific
types of research activities, which do not require further individual approval. For example, the left ventricular consensus

segmentation project [27] uses a subset from the DETERMINE cohort [28], where the data contributor has given
approval to use 200 MRI cases of patients with myocardial
infarction specifically for the development of automatic segmentation algorithms. In another framework called PCARE
[29], patients also function as data contributors, who control how their data are being shared to unaffiliated healthcare
organizations.
For the organizer who wants to set up data sharing infrastructure, the main challenges are to ensure the integrity of the
data and to establish seamless integration, storage and management of a massive amount of heterogeneous data, which may
include images, laboratory tests, diagnostic records, biological and physiological models. The information technology to
share multidimensional data over the Internet has matured in
the last decade. Several data sharing infrastructure alternatives
have been proposed in various domains, such as [6], [29]–[31].
The organizer may also be involved in processes which enrich the original patient data to make the data more useful for
broader research activities. Such data enrichment activities include ontological annotations, manual labeling, model fitting
and population analysis (see Fig. 1).
User responsibility can be defined by a data distribution agreement, which dictates the specific type of research, commitment
to secure the data within their host computer, and a potential intellectual property agreement. All conditions or restrictions on data use should be specified in the data distribution
agreement.

IV. EXISTING CARDIAC DATA SHARING
In the cardiac domain, efforts have been initiated to establish
infrastructures for data sharing by providing anonymized baseline examinations, imaging data and other derived computations,
such as anatomical models and statistical shape analysis. Table II
summarizes existing medical data sharing infrastructures, which
also include cardiovascular data.
Established in 2010, the Cardiac Atlas Project (CAP) is a
worldwide consortium to host large cardiac image data with
derived finite element models of the heart and associated diagnostic information [6]. Over 3000 cardiac MRI cases have been
contributed to the database, which are being used by more than
20 research groups worldwide for various research activities.
CAP is a registered ancillary study of MESA and has developed
methods to translate results between MESA and other studies
using atlas-based bias correction methods [32]. Patient-specific
models of the heart provide a standard coordinate system, which
map the heart according to anatomical location. CAP has developed methods to pool data from different sources in a standardized manner, and to correct bias arising from imaging or
analysis protocol. CAP is endorsed by the Society of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, which maintains an upload site
where cases can be contributed to the atlas project [33].
The anatomical models database (AMDB) is a web accessible
framework to share and reuse cardiovascular models [30], [31].
AMDB stores various cardiac geometry models, accessible for
any researchers to perform a simulation or a benchmarking study
in cardiac electrophysiology (EP) and mechanics. The aim of

1286

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. 19, NO. 4, JULY 2015

AMDB (formerly known as euHeart) is to allow multiscale
computational modeling of the heart [34]. AMDB employs a
web service tool that personalizes a geometric heart model given
binary images of the heart and cardiac parameters [35].
The integrated data analysis, anonymization and sharing
(iDASH) is a general framework to provide a scalable tool
to share and access medical data, including cardiac diseases
[36]. The iDASH stores and shares heterogeneous data from
multiple domains (see Table II). A specific infrastructure that
shares only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is provided by
PhysioNet. Currently, PhysioNet stores and freely shares large
scale deidentified recorded physiologic signals, time series and
other related biomedical data [37]. These are healthy subjects
and patients with various diseases, including sudden cardiac
death, congestive heart failures, sleep apnea, aging, epilepsy
and gait disorder. The CardioVascular Research Grid (CVRG)
provides an infrastructure to securely and seamlessly access
complex data of cardiovascular studies, including an automated
ontological labeling of anatomical differences [38]. CVRG
is currently establishing an easy access platform with cloudbased and browser-based tools without the need to install
complex software. The Virtual Imaging Platform (VIP) is another openly accessible online data sharing platform, which focuses more on computationally extensive biomedical simulation
processes [39].

V. APPLICATION: POPULATION-BASED CARDIAC REMODELING
The human heart is continuously remodeling (changing
shape) in response to pathology, aging, environmental and genetic factors. Cardiac remodeling can be maladaptive when
linked to heart failure progression [40], [41], but remodeling
can be adaptive during normal growth or intensive physical exercises. Even in the early stages of heart failure, adaptive remodeling can be observed because the heart maintains its function
in spite of pressure or volume overloading in the acute phase
of cardiac injury [42]. There is a transition from adaptive to
maladaptive remodeling in the progression of heart disease, but
when and how this transition occurs still remains unknown [43].
As illustrated in Fig. 2, population-based studies that combine
cardiac shape, function and other clinical data can characterize
these remodeling processes.
As the heart remodels, its geometry, mass, composition and
volume changes. The shape of the heart can become less elliptical and more spherical [44]. Ventricular sphericity (width
to height ratio) has been observed in symptomatic patients and
associated with decreased survival [45] and adverse remodeling [46]. Increased LV chamber dimension [47], lower systolic
dimension change [48] and hypertrophy [49] have also been observed in asymptomatic individuals. Fig. 3 shows how LV size
and sphericity were increased from normal volunteers to patients
with heart failure in a subset of cases from CAP database.
The understanding of cardiac remodeling processes is particularly important in quantifying effects of treatment and reverse remodeling [50]. Several studies have been actively investigating
how remodeling occurs in the population by using statistical

Fig. 2. Cardiac remodeling process over time (green = adaptive remodeling due to growth, red = maladaptive remodeling). Individual dots illustrate
image acquisition. The availability of big heart data may enable prediction of
remodeling and risk stratification of individuals at risk.

Fig. 3. Multivariate map constructed from the first two Principal Components
Analysis of left-ventricular shape at end-systole. Heart failure cases with and
without infarct show elevated size and sphericity with these measures. However,
hypertrophic cases are similar in these measures to normal volunteers. Data were
taken from public domain Sunnybrook cardiac dataset available from the CAP
database.

SUINESIAPUTRA et al.: BIG HEART DATA: ADVANCING HEALTH INFORMATICS THROUGH DATA SHARING IN CARDIOVASCULAR IMAGING

shape and function tools [51]–[56]. For instance, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the cardiac shapes of 102 adults born
preterm (30 weeks) and 102 age matched healthy volunteers
have shown different shape indices in adults who were born
preterm, compared with normal term controls [53]. A statistical cardiac atlas built from 1991 asymptomatic individuals has
shown a relationship between traditional risk factors (hypertension, smoking, sex and diabetes) with LV remodeling [56].
These studies have demonstrated the power of geometrical heart
shape models to identify cardiac remodeling in certain subpopulations or in later life.
VI. APPLICATION: BENCHMARKING
A major advantage of data sharing is the availability of standardized datasets that can be used to develop, validate and compare (benchmark) new automated algorithms. Benchmarking is
important to evaluate the relative efficacy of the growing number of proposed automated methods. Objective comparisons are
more difficult to perform if each published method presents
results using private data and incompatible platforms.
Community-based efforts have been made to provide platforms for benchmarking existing and emerging algorithms
through “challenges.” A left ventricular segmentation challenge
was held in 2009 using 45 cases from a mixed patient dataset
(normal, heart failure, myocardial infarction and hypertrophy)
[57]. These data are in the public domain and can be accessed directly via the CAP website. A similar challenge was run in 2011
with more cases (200 patients with myocardial infarction) [58],
which subsequently established a platform for collaboration between research groups to define a common consensus ground
truth for the myocardial segmentation [27]. Other benchmarking
frameworks utilizing cardiac data sharing include cardiac motion [59], segmentation of scar tissue in the left atrium [60], and
automated extraction of centerlines in coronary arteries [61].
Future challenges and benchmarking studies are planned, including cardiac mechanics, EP and correcting breathing motion
artifacts in perfusion MR images.
VII. CHALLENGES
The main challenge in data sharing is the willingness of
providers to release data anonymously to a wider community.
Fortunately, there is a progression toward open access data led
by national funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of
Health in the US and the National Health Services in the UK.
These efforts are driven by the need for higher reproducibility
of research outcomes. The onus is now on organizers to provide
robust and user-friendly data sharing platforms. They must guarantee to both providers and the general public that patient data
have been deidentified properly, data integrity are maintained,
and data dissemination occurs in the most secure way.
Standardization is a key technical challenge in data sharing.
The DICOM standard for storing pixel and nonpixel data (patient information, 3-D image geometry, examination records,
acquisition parameters, etc.) can change from vendor to vendor
or even software version. Picture archiving and communication
system (PACS) allows radiographic images being stored and

1287

transferred electronically within and between hospitals. Open
source PACS architectures, such as dcm4chee [62], enable quick
deployment of a web-accessible imaging data server for public
use. Data standardization is even more difficult for nonradiographic image data. Initial efforts have been proposed, including
the standardization of a modeling language (FieldML) to link
different organs and tissues [63], an open ECG format [64] and
cardiac EP key data elements [65].
Rapidly evolving technology is also a major challenge. Incompatibility of different platforms and outmoded data formats
lead to inability to reuse legacy data. Repositories need to develop data curation plans that offer realistic future-proofing to
mitigate technology obsolescence.
VIII. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
A. Novel Geometry-Based Cardiovascular
Risk Predictors
CVD primary prevention seeks to reduce risk and to prevent
disease progression. Improving risk profile has led to considerable reduction in morbidity and mortality due to CVD, yet CVD
remains the leading cause of death and disability in developed
countries. Traditional CVD risk assessments disregard the geometrical shape of the heart. Heart shape contains information
about how the heart remodels over time, as well as global and
regional function. Early diagnosis and risk stratification can be
improved by augmenting current risk assessment with shapebased risk predictors [66], a process which can be accelerated
by sharing cardiac data. More accurate risk prediction can lead
to better targeted interventions in the future.
B. Disease Modeling
The availability of cardiac shape models will enable development of computer-aided diagnosis applications [32], [67].
Subtle differences in cardiac motion, which are inherently difficult to assess, can be objectively quantified by a statistical
model of population distributions. Such applications will allow
better tracking and monitoring of the progression of a cardiac
disease over time. This becomes essential in rapidly progressing
diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, where regular assessment is needed before tailoring the treatment in each
patient [68].
C. Personalization
Collecting individual data gains statistical knowledge about
the population; a valuable resource which can be brought back
to the individuals [69] by means of personalized treatment
[34], [70], [71]. Preliminary studies in personalization include
the prediction of fiber orientation in the left ventricle [72],
heart geometry personalization [73], [74], predicting cardiac
resynchronization response [75] and generating an artificial
patient-specific model for presurgical planning [76]. Personalized medicine shows considerable promise, particularly when
connected with the availability of big heart data.

IX. CONCLUSION
Data sharing is becoming essential to the further development of the field of cardiovascular research. Large databases
are now being developed which bring together disparate types
of data and enable multivariate greater-depth analysis of information on each patient. In particular, population-based tools
have proven useful for comparing an individual’s anatomy to a
population, comparisons between subpopulations, and the detection, quantification and monitoring of disease progression.
Data-sharing initiatives will aid in the development and validation of automated data analysis methods.
