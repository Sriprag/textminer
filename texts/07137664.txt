Abstract—Goal: In this study, we report on a lead selection
method that was developed to detect the optimal bipolar electrode
placement for recording of the P-wave. Methods: The study population consisted of 117 lead body surface potential maps recorded
from 229 healthy subjects. The optimal bipolar lead was developed using the training set (172 subjects) then extracted from the
testing dataset (57 subjects) and compared to other lead systems
previously reported for improved recording of atrial activity. All
leads were assessed in terms of P-wave, QRS, and STT root mean
square (RMS). The P/QRST RMS ratio was also investigated to
determine the atrioventricular RMS ratio. Finally, the effect of
minor electrode misplacements on the P-lead was investigated. Results: The P-lead discovered in this study outperformed all other
investigated leads in terms of P-wave RMS. The P-lead showed a
significant improvement in median P-wave RMS (93 versus 72 μV,
p < 0.001) over the next best lead, Lead II. An improvement in
QRS and STT RMS was also observed from the P-lead in comparison to lead II (668 versus 573 μV, p < 0.001) and (327 versus 196
μV, p < 0.001). Although P-wave RMS was reduced by incorrect
electrode placement, significant improvement over Lead II was
still evident. Conclusion: The P-lead improves P-wave RMS signal strength over all other investigated leads. Also the P-lead does
not reduce QRS and STT RMS making it an appropriate choice
for atrial arrhythmia monitoring. Significance: Given the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio, an improvement in algorithms that
rely on P-wave analysis may be achieved.

I. INTRODUCTION
A fundamental challenge in surface electrocardiogram (ECG)
monitoring is to discern small but diagnostically relevant signals, such as P-waves, from background noise. Detection and
analysis of the P-wave on the ECG allows for assessment of
atrioventricular conduction and, as such, more accurate diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias, in particular, atrial fibrillation (AF)
[1]. Thromboembolic events such as transient ischemic attack
and stroke can be attributable to AF [2]. Strokes due to AF are
common and can be devastating with approximately 70% to

80% of patients becoming permanently disabled or dying [3].
These events are preventable with appropriate intervention [4].
However, because AF is often sporadic, intermittent (Paroxysmal AF), and asymptomatic, it can be difficult to detect using
standard detection methods.
The majority of automated AF detection algorithms rely
solely on the analysis of R–R intervals. This can lead to
false positives due to the presence of other cardiac conditions
such as sinoatrial block, ventricular systole, ectopic beats, and
supraventricular tachycardia [5]. An improvement in P-wave
detection may lead to improved detection of atrial arrhythmias
such as AF, atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia [6]. This has
prompted renewed interest in patient monitoring technology,
particularly Holter monitoring systems for 24–72 h continuous
ECG monitoring [7].
Where signal information has been considered in lead selection, most ECG lead systems have been optimized for recording
of ventricular activity. As a result, it is assumed that an optimized bipolar ECG lead could improve the detection of the Pwave, maximizing signal strength and therefore signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR). P-waves traditionally are difficult to record, especially during ambulation. This is mainly due to a low SNR
and the fact that P-waves have no exclusive time or frequency
characteristics [8].
Often P-waves from standard ECG leads are indiscernible
from electrostatic noise as a result of incorrect skin preparation, patient movement, or skeletal muscle potential [9]. Traditionally, Holter monitors often rely on a reduced number of
ECG leads (usually 1–3) for long-term continuous ECG monitoring. Single-lead ECG systems have a higher patient acceptability when compared to 12-lead and 3-lead monitors due to
the reduced number of electrodes and wires [10]. However,
this improvement in patient acceptability comes at a cost of a
significant reduction in the ECG information captured. In this
study, we determine the recording sites for a bipolar lead that
is optimized for the recording of atrial activity during normal
atrial activation.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Body Surface Potential Maps (BSPMs)
In comparison to all other recording formats, BSPMs provide
the best indication of the spatial distribution of electrical potentials on the thorax. However, BSPMs are difficult to record in a
clinical setting. As a result, the standard 12-lead has not been
surpassed as the clinical standard for the detection of cardiac
arrhythmias [11].

B. Standard 12-Lead ECG
The electrode positions for recording of the 12-lead ECG are
suboptimal in capturing atrial activity. Previous studies have
shown that Lead II and precordial Lead V1 provide the most Pwave signal strength [12]. Lux and Greg [1] demonstrated that
Leads II, III, and V1 provided the greatest P-wave signal strength
in comparison to all other leads of the standard 12-lead ECG.
Optimization of the standard 12-lead ECG for atrial activity has
also previously been investigated [13]. This optimized system,
referred to as the atrialcardiogram (ACG), used the same number
of electrodes as the 12-lead ECG however the precordial leads
were repositioned in closer proximity to the right atrium and
left atrium.
C. Modified Lead Systems for Recording Atrial Activity
In 1910, Sir T. Lewis became the first to implement an optimized bipolar ECG lead for improved recording of atrial activity.
During his pioneering work in AF, Lewis discovered that placing electrodes at the right forth-intercostal space and the right
second-costochondral junction increased the amplitude of atrial
activity [14].
This ECG lead would later go on to be named the Lewis lead.
The Lewis lead has been shown to increase P-wave amplitude
during wide-QRS tachycardia [15]. However, a comprehensive
study by Madias [16] demonstrated that P-wave amplitude from
the Lewis lead is not greater than the best lead of the 12-lead
ECG in patients with a range of cardiac illnesses. The Barker
lead [17] often referred to as the vertical sternal lead or ES on
the EASI lead system [18], involves placement of electrodes
at the xiphoid process and below the suprasternal notch of the
manubrium. Herzog et al. [19] demonstrated that the Barker
lead recorded greater P-wave signal than that of the standard
ECG leads and the Lewis lead.
Nedios et al. [20] reported that the best performing electrode
positions for a bipolar lead for P-wave amplitude was approximately the second right intercostal space and 1 in above the
xiphoid process inline with the fourth intercostal space.
More recently, a study by Pentrénas et al. [6] suggested a
modified version of the Lewis Lead for the ambulatory monitoring of atrial arrhythmias. They moved the first electrode
to superior sternum and the second electrode from the fourth
intercostal space to the fifth intercostal in an effort to reduce motion artifact from arm movement. Results showed that
the P-wave amplitude from this modified Lewis Lead was three
times greater than the original Lewis Lead. All lead systems
investigated in this study are shown in Fig. 1.
III. STUDY POPULATION
The study population consisted of 117-lead BSPMs from 229
healthy subjects. The procedure for recording the data and the
data itself have previously been described in [21], [22]. ECG
recordings at the 117 recording sites were sampled with respect
to Wilson’s central terminal resulting in 117 unipolar ECG leads.
Each ECG lead was sampled simultaneously for 15 s at a frequency of 500 Hz with a sampling resolution of 10 μV. The

atrial activity.

information from each ECG lead was reduced using selective
linear averaging of the P-wave, QRS complex, and STT segment individually resulting in a single PQRST complex. All
measurements of ECG time integrals were then made from superimposed Frank X, Y, and Z leads. In order to provide greater
spatial resolution, the 117-lead BSPMs were transformed using
a Laplacian 3-D interpolation procedure into 352 nodes which
correspond to the nodes on the Dalhousie torso [23]. Some of
the required electrocardiographic leads were not available as a
direct subset of the interpolated BSPMs. Further electrode positions were then obtained using linear interpolation. This method
of interpolation has been reported to produce interpolation errors that are smaller than the level of noise typically found in
the precordial leads [24]. The data were then split into a training
set consisting of 172 patients and a testing set consisting of the
remaining 57 subjects.
IV. METHOD
A. ECG Processing and Data analysis
For this study, we implemented a method of determining the
point in time where the maximum P-wave amplitude occurs
across all 352 nodes for each subject. The method is outlined as
Pdiﬀ (n) = Pm ax (n) − Pm in (n)

(1)

where Pdiﬀ (n) is the maximal P-wave amplitude for a defined
point in time n, Pm ax is the maximum P-wave value across
all 352 BSPM nodes at n, Pm in is the minimum P-wave value
across all 352 BSPM nodes at n.
The point in time containing the maximum P-wave amplitude
for each subject was defined as the instance in time where the
greatest differential P-wave (Fig. 2) occurred.

Unipolar Leads

From this median BSPM, the population-based optimal bipolar
lead was defined as the location of the maximum and minimum
P-wave amplitude.
B. Lead Evaluation

Fig. 2. Differential P-wave values for one subject. The maximum difference
in P-wave amplitude across all 352 nodes occurred at 0.054 s (solid line).

P-wave values at this point in time were then extracted across
all 352 nodes. Each subjects P-wave value were normalized
between 0 and 1, as outlined in (2). This step was taken to
alleviate the bias attributable to dominant p-wave values from
individual subjects
Pnorm =

Pam p − min(Pam p )
max(Pam p ) − min(Pam p )

(2)

where Pnorm is the normalized P-wave values and Pam p is the
nonnormalized P-wave values. This method was repeated for all
172 subjects of the training set producing one BSPM, of P-wave
amplitudes, for each subject. A population based P-wave BSPM
was then calculated by taking the median of the P-wave potentials on each node of the BSPM across all 172 subjects, resulting
in a single BSPM of P-wave amplitudes across the population.

The performance of the population-based optimal bipolar lead
was assessed in terms of signal strength and compared to the
lead systems described in Table I. Each lead system was also
assessed in terms of QRS and STT signal strength in order
to determine if any QRS or STT signal strength had been lost
when optimizing the bipolar electrode placement for the P-wave.
This assessment allows for the identification of the ECG lead
with the best signal strength for both the P-wave and the QRS.
Previous work has shown that, for accurate detection of atrial
arrhythmias such as AF, a combination of both R–R interval and
P-wave analysis is advantageous [25]. This, therefore, requires
both the QRS complex and the P-wave to have high SNRs.
1) Signal Strength: Experiments were conducted to compare
signal root-mean-square (RMS) and signal amplitude of the
P-wave, QRS complex, and STT segment from the optimized
ECG lead to that which would be obtained from the standard
and previously reported lead systems described in Table I.
2) Atrioventricular Ratio: Many P-wave detection algorithms rely on QRST cancellation through template subtraction [26] or wavelet decomposition [27]. When selecting leads
for QRST cancellation methods Lead II and V1 are often
chosen due to an increased atrioventricular ratio [12]. In this
study, all investigated leads were assessed in terms of P/QRST
RMS ratio to identify which lead is the most appropriate for
QRST cancellation.
3) Electrode Misplacement: ECG electrode misplacement is
a common error encountered in clinical practice with up to 36%
of 12-lead ECGs recorded using incorrect electrode positions
[28]. ECG signal strength and morphology can differ greatly due

to incorrect electrode placement. Previous studies have shown
that when applying the precordial leads of the 12-lead ECG
an average electrode misplacement of 1.14 in is observed [29].
This can lead to false positives and false negatives when monitoring for arrhythmias. In this study, we investigated the effects of electrode misplacement on P-wave signal strength from
the P-lead.
The electrodes were repositioned to four incorrect locations
in a 0.5-in radius around the correct electrode locations shown
in Fig. 4. This resulted in 16 potential misplacement scenarios. Median P-wave RMS and the interquartile range were then
calculated to allow for a comparison between scenarios.
C. Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis compared P-wave RMS values from the
best performing lead (P-lead) to the second best performing lead
(lead II). As the results are not normally distributed (see Fig. 3),
the median value of the signal RMS and interquartile range was
calculated for each lead across all 57 subjects in the test data
in order to provide a measure of performance. A comparison of
the median RMS values between the different leads was then
performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test [30].
V. RESULTS
The maximum attainable P-wave RMS signal strength for
the lead configurations under investigation are provided in
Table II. The P-lead outperformed the other lead systems under
investigation. The median P-wave RMS from the P-lead was
significantly (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, α = 0.05) greater than

from the next best lead, Lead II, (93 versus 72 μV, p < 0.001).
Median P-wave amplitude recorded from the P-lead was also
improved (164 versus 132 μV, p < 0.001). The findings of the
experiments investigating signal RMS and signal amplitude for
the P-wave, QRS complex, and STT segment across all lead
systems under investigation can be seen in Table II (see also
Table III and Figs. 5 and 6). The P-lead captured the greatest
P-wave RMS without reducing QRS or STT signal strength.
Anatomical locations of the bipolar P-lead electrodes are shown
in Fig. 7.
VI. DISCUSSION
Historically P-waves have been difficult to detect, possibly
due to the fact that many lead systems focus primarily on the
optimal detection of ventricular events. The ventricles differ
greatly from the atrium in terms of spatial location, orientation, and signal amplitude [31]. Recording of atrial activity is
therefore not optimal from many lead systems and a lead system for the recording of atrial activity is highly desirable. In
the previous sections, we have outlined a method that results
in a bipolar ECG lead that allows for maximum P-wave signal
strength. This method was designed to account for the known
variance in P-wave morphology across ECG leads [32]. The
method described uses are based upon a simple analysis of the
atrial information in each BSPM, determining the point in time
where the greatest difference in P-wave amplitude occurred.
The optimized lead found in this study demonstrated a significant improvement in median P-wave RMS (93 versus 72 μV,
p < 0.001) and median P-wave amplitude (164 versus 132 μV,
p < 0.001) over the next best lead, lead II. An improvement in
median QRS signal strength (668 versus 573 μV, p < 0.001) and
median QRS amplitude (1660 versus 1472 μV, p < 0.001) was
also observed. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the
P-lead in capturing maximum information during atrial depolarization without compromising QRS signal strength. The P-lead
could be used in applications such as long-term ambulatory
ECG monitoring for atrial arrhythmias, which requires maximum SNR during both atrial and ventricular depolarization.

Most Holter monitoring systems implement the Mason–Likar
leads [33] (I, II, and III) in combination with a single precordial
lead for long-term monitoring [34]. More recently, single-lead
ECG monitors have been shown to have greater patient acceptability. P-wave signal strength from the P-lead is increased when
compared to other lead systems commonly used in arrhythmia
monitoring making it an appropriate choice when monitoring
for atrial arrhythmias.
It has been shown previously that the most effective AF algorithms incorporate both R–R interval and P-wave analysis
[25]. Many algorithms, due to the low SNR (in particular during
ambulation), do not utilize P-wave information. The P-lead may

allow a different approach to algorithm development in this area
and although improved signal strength does not guarantee better
algorithm performance improvement is highly likely. The maximum atrial-ventricular RMS ratio was achieved when using the
modified Lewis lead. This makes the modified Lewis lead the
most appropriate lead for QRST cancellation techniques. This
lead, therefore, cannot be used to assess ventricular activity
given the reduction in QRS and STT signal strength. Misplacement of the bipolar electrodes used to record the P-lead did cause
a significant (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, α = 0.05) reduction in

P-wave RMS (93 versus 79 μV, p<0.001); however, even with
this reduction, the P-lead still significantly (Wilcoxon signedrank test, α = 0.05) outperformed the next best lead, lead II
(79 versus 72 μV, p<0.001). This demonstrates a robustness of
the P-lead to electrode misplacement, which may improve its
effectiveness when implemented clinically.
VII. CONCLUSION
The optimized lead discovered in this research outperformed
all other lead systems under investigation in terms of P-wave
RMS. What remains to be tested is the performance of automated algorithms using the P-lead. It will be of interest to assess
if the improvement in previously described algorithms can be
achieved using the P-lead, given the associated improvement in
SNR.
The close proximity of the identified electrode positions to
the right clavicle and the costal margin are expected to allow accurate electrode positioning in a clinical setting. However, even
with small misplacements of the bipolar electrodes (<0.5 inch) a
significant improvement in P-wave signal strength over all other
leads is still achieved. The electrode positions discovered in this
study may also provide better performance in terms of SNR
during ambulation due to their central location of the electrode
positions on the torso, away from moving body parts and large
muscle groups. This study has shown that during normal atrial
activation, optimized lead selection can lead to an improvement
in P-wave signal strength.
VIII. FUTURE WORK
If algorithm improvement is discovered from the improved
SNR from the P-lead, an estimation of this lead from standard
12-lead ECGs may prove to be of benefit, particularly in patients with low P-wave amplitude. This will improve P-wave
information without changing the standard clinical practice of
ECG acquisition. Further investigations must also be performed
on patients with atrial arrhythmias to assess if abnormal atrial
activation can affect the performance of the P-lead. If so, this
would suggest that a two lead system capable of maximizing
SNR during both normal and abnormal atrial activation may
prove most effective in detecting atrial arrhythmias.
