An Analysis of Contrast Agent Flow Patterns
From Sequential Ultrasound Images Using a Motion
Estimation Algorithm Based on Optical Flow Patterns
Ju Hwan Lee, Yoo Na Hwang, Sung Yun Park, Jong Seob Jeong, and Sung Min Kim*

Abstract—This study estimates flow patterns of contrast
agents from successive ultrasound image sequences by using an
anisotropic diffusion-based optical flow algorithm. Before flow
fields were recovered, the test sequences were reconstructed using relative composition of structural and textural parts from the
original image. To improve estimation performance, an anisotropic
diffusion filtering model was embedded into a spline-based slightly
nonconvex total variation-L1 minimization algorithm. In addition,
an incremental coarse-to-fine warping framework was employed
with a linear minimization scheme to account for a large displacement. After each warping iteration, the implementation used
intermediate bilateral filtering to prevent oversmoothing across
motion boundaries. The performance of the proposed algorithm
was tested using three different sequences obtained from two simulated datasets and phantom ultrasound sequences. The results
indicate the robust performance of the proposed method under different noise environments. The results of the phantom study also
demonstrate reliable performance according to different injection
conditions of contrast agents. These experimental results suggest
the potential clinical applicability of the proposed algorithm to
ultrasonographic diagnosis based on contrast agents.

I. INTRODUCTION
IGH-RESOLUTION contrast-enhanced ultrasound
(CEUS) is widely used to diagnose arterial disease
because it allows for the static and noninvasive assessment
of dynamic wall morphology on a real-time basis. CEUS is
effective in imaging blood perfusion in organs and can measure
the blood flow rate in the heart and other organs [1], and it also
enables clinicians to examine the anatomical course, thereby
providing a wide range of clinical information, including the
origin and exact location of lesions [2], [3]. In addition, contrast
agents show specific enhancement characteristics for lesions
according to different injection phases (arterial, portal venous,
and delayed phases) on CEUS [4], [5]. These flow patterns

can provide useful diagnostic information on surrounding
tissue. In clinical practice, the interpretation of ultrasonography
depends mainly on manual measurement or visual inspection
by an experienced operator. However, manual assessments
are time-consuming, and visual methods generally show poor
accuracy because of nonlinear motion patterns and the presence
of structure noise in the image [6]. These problems can be more
serious in the evaluation of organ images with small lesions
because only small edges provide motion information.
An advanced image-processing approach is thus highly desirable for improving patient satisfaction and diagnostic interpretations. The quantification of motion dynamics through accurate
image processing can provide useful physiological characteristics from targeted lesions [7]. Using these characteristics, suspicious lesions, which are visually undistinguishable can be easily
separated from ambiguous regions.
However, estimating motion fields of particular regions in a
series of CEUS images remains challenging because of noisy
images, nonrigid motions, and image intensities that vary over
time. Existing approaches to the motion analysis are relatively
limited and focus mainly on estimating myocardial and arterial
wall deformations by using various estimation methods. One
of the first attempts to quantitatively analyze cardiac motions
includes the use of differential optical flow techniques based on
synthesized echo image sequences [8]. Here, it has been shown
that reliable estimation results can be obtained using the Horn–
Schunck (HS) [9] and Lucas–Kanade (LK) [10] techniques. To
account for typical heart deformations, Sühling et al. [11] analyzed echocardiographic sequences by using a linear model in
time and a local-affine model for the velocity in the space. The
algorithm was validated using synthetic datasets based on rotating phantom and animal experiment sequences. Malpica et al.
[12] provided a comparative analysis to investigate the use of
block-matching and optical flow techniques for the repositioning of the region of interest (ROI) and found better performance
for differential optical flow methods under a similar computational load. Duan et al. [13] employed an optical flow method
in real-time 3-D ultrasound sequences, and obtained dense and
dynamic myocardium motion fields, although they provided no
quantitative assessment. On the other hand, Stoitsis et al. [14]
computed motion patterns of the arterial wall from temporal
sequences of digitized B-mode ultrasound and found that correlation coefficients were significantly higher in the radial direction. Golemati et al. [15] compared estimation performance
for carotid artery wall motions between optical flow and blockmatching techniques by using a mathematical model describing

the mechanical deformation of the arterial wall. In addition, previous studies have employed discrete wavelet-based image decomposition techniques with weighted least-squares and affine
optical flow methods to estimate radial and longitudinal arterial
wall displacements from B-mode ultrasound [16], [17].
Despite these efforts, existing motion estimation approaches
have two major limitations. First, nonrigid motions cannot be
properly estimated from ultrasonic images due to the difficulty
in allowing motion discontinuities. Second, previous studies
have investigated typical cases of motions only for the carotid
arterial wall and cardiac dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, no study has estimated flow patterns of contrast agents
themselves from continuous CEUS sequences. Contrast agents
can enhance the contrast/intensity at the interface between the
tissue and blood. In addition, microbubbles provide detailed
flow information for suspicious regions during various injection phases. These characteristics enable the clinician to better visually inspect organ structures. However, the difficulty in
quantitatively evaluating the flow field of microbubbles reduces
diagnostic accuracy, particularly in lesions that are not visually
distinguishable. Therefore, it is possible to improve the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS, when motion fields of contrast agents
are estimated quantitatively.
This study estimated flow patterns of contrast agents from
successive ultrasound images using the motion estimation
method based on optical flow patterns. For this purpose, original
test sequences were recomposed with the relative composition of
structural and textural parts. To improve estimation accuracy for
nonrigid motions, an anisotropic diffusion model was embedded into a spline-based slightly nonconvex total variation (TV)L1 approximation scheme. The performance of the proposed
method was verified using experimental datasets from synthetic
noise sequences, as well as sequences from a tissue-mimicking
phantom. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces the proposed motion estimation algorithm and
experimental conditions. Section III presents the experimental
results, and Section IV discusses them. Finally, we conclude our
findings in Section V.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Image Recomposition Using the STD Method
Before flow patterns of microbubbles were computed from
ultrasound images, original images were decomposed into
two components containing geometric and textural information
based on the structure-texture decomposition (STD) method
(see Fig. 1). The general concept underlying this method is
that an image can be regarded as composed of a structural part
containing mainly large objects in an image and a textural part
corresponding to detailed, fine-scale objects [18]. The structural
part of the target image can be obtained through the nonlinear
TV-based noise removal model in [19]

where o refers to the original image, s indicates the structural part, and ω is a constant that is small and positive. The

the phantom ultrasound image sequence: (a) original image, (b) structural image, (c) textural image, and (d) recomposed image with the relative ratio of

textural part t is calculated by subtracting s with the blending
factor α from o (t = o − as). According to previous research
[20], the blending factor has a significant effect on estimation
performance. Therefore, the tracking accuracy of the proposed
method was evaluated using various synthetic datasets including a wide range of textural information according to different
blending factors varying from 0.0 to 1.0 at 0.1 intervals. Based
on preliminary results [20], the optimum blending factor was
set to 0.8, which was expected to provide robust performance
for estimating flow fields of contrast agents from ultrasound
images.
Fig. 1(b) and (c) provides examples of structural and textural
images, respectively. As we can see, the structural part showed
only small differences in comparison to the original image due
to the presence of the main large objects. On the other hand,
relatively large differences were observed in the textural part
because this part included mainly fine details. Based on [20],
the original image was reconstructed with a relative ratio of
structure:texture = 1:4 [see Fig. 1(d)].
B. Proposed Flow Estimation Algorithm
For two sequential image frames I0 and I1 located in a rectangular domain Ω ∈ R2 , the objective function of the traditional
optical flow model was formulated as

where u = u(u1 (x), u2 (x))T represents the vectorized flow
field to be recovered, and D and δ denote data and smoothness penalty functions, respectively. The free parameter η balances the relative weight between these penalty terms. The data
function D(u, x) measures the similarity between I0 and I1 as

as follows:
D(u, x) = ϕ(I0 (x) − I1 (x + u(x))

where ϕ is a properly chosen penalty function. The original TVL1 minimization
approach employs

where the small constant κ is 0.001. However, a slightly
nonconvex model generally presents more robust estimation
performance in well-textured cases, whereas more nonconvex
conditions provide no improvements [21]. To obtain more reliable motion estimates, the aforementioned original TV-L1
terms were replaced with slightly nonconvex penalty funcψ

tions ϕ(x2 ) = x2 + κ2 and δ(∇u) = |∇u|2 + κ2 with
ψ = 0.45.
The new version of the slightly nonconvex model propagated
motion flows in all direction regardless of the local properties
because the smoothness term altered so far was still isotropic
[22]. To enhance flow propagation, anisotropic diffusion filtering was employed in the smoothness term. Through this
anisotropic function, the overpropagation of flow motions for
image boundaries such as corners and edges decreased significantly, and flow patterns of nontextured (or weakly textured)
regions recovered properly. Perona and Malik [23] introduced
the fundamental concept of the traditional anisotropic diffusion
scheme. To reduce the computational load, a modified version
of [24] was used in the slightly nonconvex smoothness term

A(|∇I|) = e

where A represents the diffusion tensor, and α and β are constants. As a result, the slightly nonconvex algorithm is

However, it was not easy to minimize the energy function in
(6), mainly because of the difficult linearization process. To simplify the optimization procedure, Chambolle’s [25] projected
gradient descent algorithm was also used to provide fast and
robust performance. If the displacement u is in close proximity to a given disparity map u0 (x) = (u1o , u20 )T from (6), then
the image residual p(x) = I0 (x) − I1 (x + u(x)), which leads
to the classical optical flow formulation, can be linearized as
follows [17]:
ρ(x) = Itd (x) + (∇I1 (x))T (u(x) − u0 (x))

(7)

where Itd (x) = I0 (x) − I1 (x + u0 (x)) denotes the temporal
derivative of the image intensity. Therefore, (6) can be rewritten


E = min

(8)

Ω

where ρ(u) represents the well-known optical flow constraint
equation that cannot extract relatively large displacements.
To account for large displacements, the above linear approximation of the image residual was embedded into an incremental
coarse-to-fine warping framework. The coarse-to-fine scheme
enabled propagation from well-textured areas to weakly textured
ones. In addition, an iterative warping scheme further compensated for image nonlinearities. For this purpose, complete image
pyramids with arbitrary pyramidal levels were generated. Furthermore, an auxiliary parameter v(x) = (v1 (x), v2 (x))T was
introduced to decouple data and smoothness terms, and simplify
the minimization procedure

where γ and v denote a small positive constant and a close

(9), the overall problem remained slightly nonconvex. This minimization problem in u and v was solved by repetitively alternating the minimization procedure for both u and v at each
iteration level. In the recovery of the unknown displacement u
with a fixed value of v, the above approximation was converted
into (10), whereas the formulation was translated as (11) in
calculating v with a fixed value of u

and (d) real B-mode ultrasound sequence. Each arrow indicates the direction and the displacement of pixel.

C. Modeling of Simulated Datasets by Using Synthetic
and Real B-Mode Ultrasound Image Sequences Under
Different Noise Conditions
For the quantitative evaluation of the proposed motion estimation method, two types of simulated image sequences composed
of two different textural images (Brodatz-Bark and BrodatzWeave) [26] and a real B-mode ultrasound image were generated in conjunction with an affine “rotation” transformation,
as shown in Fig. 2(a). Textural images were selected because
textural information is similar to real ultrasound images, which
are generally full of small structural elements [see Fig. 2(b) and
(c)]. Real ultrasound datasets were obtained from the routine
abdomen ultrasonography of a healthy subject [see Fig. 2(d)].
These datasets enabled an analysis of the motion behavior of
the proposed algorithm under controlled noise levels. After the
deformation of an affine image, the simulated datasets (S0 ) were
corrupted with the Gaussian noise, resulting in one additional
image sequence with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of
20 dB (STG20 and SBG20 ). In addition, three additional sequences with increasing speckle noise levels of 20 (STSP20 ),
15 (STSP15 ), and 10 dB (STSP10 ) were generated for textural
images, and 30 (SBSP30 ), 25 (SBSP25 ), and 20 dB (SBSP20 ) for
real B-mode ultrasound images. Based on these experimental
datasets, it was possible to evaluate the estimation accuracy of
the proposed algorithm quantitatively, although the image deformation was relatively simplified and idealized.
D. Motion Analysis of Phantom Ultrasound Image Sequences
The performance of the algorithm in terms of estimating flow
patterns of contrast agents from ultrasound images was evaluated through a phantom experiment. Temporal sequences of
digitized harmonic ultrasound images of phantom vessels were
obtained using a commercial tissue mimicking phantom (VP-3,
ATS Laboratories, Inc., Bridgeport, CT, USA). This phantom
included three simulated vessels that were 5.0, 6.0, and 8.0 mm
in diameter at different depths [see Fig. 3(a)]. The vessels are
capsulated in materials mimicking soft tissue consisting of a
rubber matrix. The SonoVue contrast agent (Bracco Diagnostics, Milano, Italy) was injected into each phantom vessel under
different flow rates (8.68 , 6.00, 3.40, and 0.75 ml/min) by using
a commercial syringe pump (LSP01–1A, LongerPump, Hebei,

Fig. 3. (a) Simulated tissue-mimicking phantom which includes three different vessels with 5.0 (D1), 6.0 (D2), and 8.0 mm (D3) diameters at different

China). The contrast agent was diluted in 5 ml of normal saline
solution. Phantom sequences were recorded with the Accuvix V
10 (Samsung Medison Corp., Seoul, Korea) ultrasound system
equipped with a 2–5-MHz convex array probe (C2–5EL, Samsung Medison Corp., Seoul, Korea) on a real-time basis during

LEE et al.: ANALYSIS OF CONTRAST AGENT FLOW PATTERNS FROM SEQUENTIAL ULTRASOUND IMAGES

the continuous infusion of the contrast agent. Phantom vessels
were imaged in longitudinal sections based on the following
scanner settings: the actual frequency of 4.17 MHz, a dynamic
range of 105 dB, a gain of 50 dB, a view depth of 6 cm, and a
2-D harmonic gray scale. To avoid the microbubble disruption,
a mechanical index was set to 0.68. Sequences were recorded at
a frame rate of 62 frames/s for 8 s under different flow rates.
Since motion patterns were computed for all image pixels,
an ROI of 172 × 120 pixel2 was designated in phantom vessel
regions to facilitate the identification of flow fields of contrast
agents. Here, the pixel size was 0.294 mm. Motion fields of the
rectangular ROI were continuously recovered at a frame rate
of 62 frames/s for 8 s under different flow rates. Fig. 3(a) and
(b) shows the tissue-mimicking phantom and its corresponding
ultrasonic images with a vessel 6.0 mm in diameter, respectively.
E. Algorithm Implementation
Since the approximation model was valid for accommodating small displacements, it was embedded into an incremental coarse-to-fine warping framework. A warping approach was
taken for each level of the image pyramid. Under the framework,
the matrices u, v, and p were set to zero at the coarsest level.
For each warping, flow fields of contrast agents were computed
by solving (9) in an iterative manner. Reconstructed displacement fields were then prolongated from each coarser level to a
finer one. During the flow estimation procedure, typical warping values and iterations were set to 5 and 35, respectively.
The pyramid factor was 0.8, and the number of levels relied
on the size of the input image. In the experiment, numbers
of levels were 14 for synthetic images (512 × 512 pixel2 ) and
8 for real ultrasound images (160 × 120 pixel2 ) and phantom
ultrasound image sequences (172 × 120 pixel2 ). Data fidelity
factors were λ = 1, 000 and θ = 0.5. For anisotropic diffusion
filtering, constant values of α and β were designated as 5 and
1/2, respectively.
To derive the spatial derivative of the image, a spline-based
interpolation approach was adopted with a five-point mask
1/12[−1 8 0 −8 1] at each warping step. Then, flow fields
delivered from the coarser level to a next finer level between
the first and warped second images were computed. To address
image boundaries, corresponding temporal and spatial derivatives were set to zero. Derivatives of images were calculated
using central differences. Moreover, the implementation used a
5 × 5 bilateral filtering method [27] after each warping iteration to preserve large displacements and prevent oversmoothing
across motion boundaries. This filtering not only reduced the
effect of intensity-dissimilar pixels, but also regularized flow
computations because flow discontinuities were significantly
discriminated. All parameters were kept under the same conditions during the flow computation, and all image processing
was carried out using the MATLAB software package (R2011b,
MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA).
F. Error Measurement
The estimation performance of the proposed method was evaluated in terms of the warping index (WI) [28] and the end point

53

error (EPE) [29] for two simulated image datasets. The WI can
be defined as a mean geometric error in pixels between correct
(WC ) and estimated displacements (WE ) as follows:

 
1
WE (n, x) − WC (n, x)2 (16)
WI =
NROI T
n ∈T x∈ROI

where NROI represents the number of pixels in the ROI and T is
the total number of images in the sequence. Here, the EPE can
be represented as an absolute displacement error of endpoint
pixels between estimated (m0 , n0 ) and correct (m1 , n1 ) flow
patterns

(17)
EPE = (m0 − m1 )2 + (n0 − n1 )2 .
Because the WI and the EPE reflect flow errors between estimated and actual motions, higher tracking accuracy is obtained
as its value approaches zero.
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This section presents a series of experiments to assess the
accuracy of the algorithm. For validation purposes, the estimation performance of the proposed algorithm was assessed using
three different sequences obtained from two simulated datasets
and phantom ultrasound scans. Motion fields reconstructed from
texture datasets were quantitatively evaluated using the EPE and
the WI, and flow estimates for phantom image sequences were
compared through an analysis of the flow magnitude and a visual inspection by a skilled clinician. To better identify regions
of abnormal flow patterns, vectorized flow fields were color
coded using a reliable color map [30]. The proposed method
was compared to the HS, LK, and modified TV-L1 [31] optical
flow techniques.
A. Comparison of Motion Estimation Results for Simulated
Texture Image Sequences for Different Noise Types
and PSNR Levels
Fig. 2(a) shows the ground-truth vector field of affine deformation for two different textural and real B-mode ultrasound
sequences. As shown in Figs. 4(a) and 5(a), the HS method
did not compute any rotational motion patterns from the original textural image. The worst performing method in terms of
the EPE and the WI was the HS method, followed by the LK
method, which performed marginally better. However, the LK
method was able to extract motion patterns of only central regions [see Figs. 4(b) and 5(b)]. Although the TV-L1 scheme
performed better with relatively low EPE and WI values (see
Table I), it still entailed numerous estimation errors, particularly
for the edge regions [see Figs. 4(c) and 5(c)]. These mislocation
vectors were found in the same regions of each textural image sequence, and they were noticeable in the Brodatz-Weave
image, with almost two and five times higher EPE and WI values, respectively (see Table I). On the other hand, the proposed
method successfully recovered all rotational motion patterns by
effectively removing estimation errors for two simulated textural images [see Figs. 4(d) and 5(d)]. In addition, the proposed
method outperformed the other three, having the lowest EPE

54

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 1, JANUARY 2015

and WI for all test sequences (see Table I). Table I shows the
EPE and the WI for each simulated textural image with different
noise types and its PSNRs based on motion patterns estimated
by the proposed and existing methods.
As shown in Table I, the EPE and the WI are generally increased under the Gaussian noise environment. However, the
HS method showed lower values for weave image sequences
under the Gaussian noise condition and produced similar results under speckle noise conditions with PSNRs ranging from
10 to 20 dB. Under this condition, the HS method yielded EPE
and WI values much lower than those for the original image,
although the noise level increased with a decrease in the PSNR.
The proposed algorithm consistently increased the EPE and the
WI with the addition of Gaussian and speckle noise levels with
different PSNR levels to the original textural image. In addition,
the proposed algorithm showed the best performance in terms
of both the EPE and the WI (see Table I).

Datasets for Different Noise Types and PSNR Levels

affine “rotation” transformation using the existing and proposed approaches:
(a) HS method, (b) LK method, (c) TV-L1 method, and (d) the proposed method.
Each arrow indicates direction and displacement of the pixel.

According to the reconstructed motion fields presented in
Fig. 6, the proposed method provided robust estimation results for rotational motion patterns and yielded the lowest EPE
and WI values. The HS method provided the worst estimation performance for real ultrasound image datasets, generally
failing to compute rotational motion patterns [see Fig. 6(a)].
The LK method provided slightly better motion fields from
central regions but entailed numerous errors in edges [see
Fig. 6(b)]. Although these errors were reasonably reduced by the
TV-L1 scheme, numerous mislocation vectors remained on the
less textured upper left-hand and lower right-hand corners [see
Fig. 6(c)]. The difficulty in allowing for less textured regions
reduced estimation accuracy, with EPE and WI values almost 14
and five times higher, respectively, than those for the proposed
method (see Table II).
The addition of 20-dB Gaussian noise slightly reduced the estimation accuracy of all employed approaches, and the level of
performance decreased gradually with a decrease in the PSNR
in speckle noise environments. The resulting errors are summarized in Table II. The most robust tracking performance in all
noise environments was provided by the proposed method in
terms of the EPE and the WI, followed by the TV-L1 method.
C. Comparison of Flow Fields of Microbubbles Obtained
From Phantom Ultrasound Images Between the Existing
and Proposed Approaches Under Different Injection
Conditions of Contrast Agents

Each arrow indicates the direction and the displacement of the pixel.

To test the ability to recover flow patterns of microbubbles
from ultrasound images, flow estimates were compared under
different injection conditions of contrast agents. Figs. 7 and 8
clearly show the vectorized and color-coded flow estimation results for the four methods. All existing approaches showed poor
performance under all flow rates, producing numerous estimation errors in lower and upper regions of the central vessel where
there was no actual flow. The HS and LK methods showed the
worst performance. The TV-L1 method somewhat addressed

displacement variables as the flow rate decreased. Similar flow
patterns were observed in other phantom vessel environments
with a diameter of 5 or 8 mm.

these limitations but still provided limited performance [see
Figs. 7(d) and 8(c)]. On the other hand, the proposed method outperformed the other three minimizing estimation errors in upper
and lower regions, and extracted distinct vessel motions from ultrasound images [see Figs. 7(e) and 8(d)]. Fig. 7(f) demonstrates
the superimposed flow estimates with the velocity field for the
ROI image.
Tables III, IV, V, and VI summarize the flow magnitude,
and axial and radial displacements of the phantom vessel with
diameter of 6 mm under different flow rates. The HS method
presented the largest axial and radial displacements, whereas the
TV-L1 method revealed the smallest displacements. The same
displacements were obtained under all flow rates. In addition,
the existing approaches showed irregular variation tendencies
when the flow rate decreased from 8.68 to 0.75 ml/min, although
the overall flow magnitude decreased. These irregularities were
observed only under flow rates of 6.00 and 3.50 ml/min, with
a consistent decrease in the flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. On the
other hand, the proposed method provided outstanding perfor-

Because correct motion fields are not available in real ultrasound sequences, a quantitative analysis using simulated
datasets providing ground-truth data is crucial for estimating
performance. This allows for the quantification of the accuracy
of reconstructed motion vector fields, which is not possible with
real images. In addition, the use of a synthetic phantom is useful for evaluating flow fields of contrast agents, since it allows
for an analysis of flow patterns of microbubbles according to
different vessel sizes and injection conditions. In this regard,
the performance of the proposed method was validated through
quantitative and qualitative analyses using the two aforementioned datasets.
According to the quantitative analysis using two simulated
datasets, the traditional global and local optical flow methods
showed the lowest estimation performance for all test image
sequences. The HS method could not recover rotational motion
patterns of the original image. More specifically, it could not
accurately estimate textural information because of its inherent limitation that minimizes the global energy function [32]. In
addition, this method produced irregular flow results in all Gaussian and speckle noise environments. Although the LK scheme
provided slightly better performance through the assumption
of local constancy [32], it estimated only central motion vectors for all datasets. Golemati et al. [15] reported that the LK
method is suitable for a motion analysis of the carotid artery
wall from ultrasound sequences because of its local-rigidity
principle. According to the present study’s experimental results,
however, the traditional global and local approaches could not
properly extract motion vector fields, particularly in image sequences including large textural information, such as ultrasound
images. The TV-L1 scheme showed much better performance.
More specifically, the nonconvex minimization model led to an
accurate estimation of textural features [31]. However, minor
estimation errors remained. On the other hand, the proposed
method based on a slightly nonconvex anisotropic minimization model provided the best performance in terms of reducing
estimation errors and extracting textural information in all simu-

lated image sequences. Despite these advantages, the estimation
accuracy of the proposed method decreased in comparison to
that of the other methods when the PSNR level decreased. This
is mainly due to the regularization of flow computations by the
employed intermediate bilateral filtering. However, this effect
was not significant, and the proposed method showed the best
performance in terms of the EPE and the WI under all noise
conditions.
For phantom ultrasound sequences, the existing approaches
showed a number of tracking errors in lower and upper regions
of the central vessel where there was no actual motion. One
main reason for this inferior performance is that motion discontinuities were not properly allowed during the minimization
procedure. As mentioned earlier, the HS method even failed to
distinguish largely textured phantom vessel regions from the
background because of its difficulty recovering local motions
and produced excessively large axial and radial displacements.
Despite the further smoothing of large displacement differences
between neighboring pixels [10], the LK method was not appropriate for ultrasound images because of its insufficient ability
to reduce errors. These results demonstrate that the traditional
global and local approaches were not suitable for the flow estimation of contrast agents from ultrasound sequences. However,
the proposed algorithm not only distinctly separated central
vessel regions but also showed robustness in estimating contrast
agent flow fields by allowing motion discontinuities through a
slightly nonconvex model.
The results of a comparative evaluation of displacement variables under different flow rates also demonstrate the performance superiority of the proposed method. In the experiment,
the ultrasound transducer was located in the same position of
tissue mimicking phantom, and contrast agents were injected
only with varying injection flow rates from 8.68 to 0.75 ml/min.

There were no further changes during the entire experiment.
Therefore, the flow magnitude of the phantom vessel ideally
decreased with a decrease in the flow rate. However, the existing approaches showed discontinuous flow patterns under a
decreasing flow rate. In particular, these discontinuities were
noticeable under flow rates of 6.00 and 3.40 ml/min. This

irregularity may be due to the inaccurate recovery of relatively large motions. On the other hand, in the case of the
flow rate of 0.75 ml/min, where only small flow motions existed, all employed approaches ideally reduced axial and radial
displacements in comparison to the flow rate of 8.68 ml/min.
Using an incremental multiresolution framework led to

the detection of not only small interframe displacements
but also large flow motions simultaneously. Therefore, the
proposed method showed the most robust performance
in terms of estimating flow vector fields of contrast
agents under different phantom vessel sizes and injection
conditions.

V. CONCLUSION
The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed motion estimation method for estimating contrast agent flow fields from ultrasound sequences.
The proposed approach showed superior performance in terms
of reducing noise and allowing motion discontinuities for different noise types and PSNR levels. In addition, the results of
a phantom experiment reveal the reliability of its performance
under different injection conditions of contrast agents. These
experimental results suggest the clinical applicability of the proposed method to ultrasonographic diagnostic techniques based
on contrast agent. For more robust results, future research should
consider experiments using liver ultrasound datasets. In addition, discriminability for representative liver diseases, including
hemangioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and focal nodular hyperplasia, should be evaluated according to different injection
phases of contrast agents.
