The Past, Present, and Future of Real-Time
Control in Cellular Electrophysiology
Jennifer A. Bauer, Katherine M. Lambert, and John A. White∗

Abstract—For over 60 years, real-time control has been an important technique in the study of excitable cells. Two such controlbased technologies are reviewed here. First, voltage-clamp methods
revolutionized the study of excitable cells. In this family of techniques, membrane potential is controlled, allowing one to parameterize a powerful class of models that describe the voltage-current
relationship of cell membranes simply, flexibly, and accurately.
Second, dynamic-clamp methods allow the addition of new, “virtual” membrane mechanisms to living cells. Dynamic clamp allows
researchers unprecedented ways of testing computationally based
hypotheses in biological preparations. The review ends with predictions of how control-based technologies will be improved and
adapted for new uses in the near future.
Index Terms—Control Systems, dynamic clamp, electrophysiology, patch clamp, voltage clamp.

I. INTRODUCTION
HE goal of this study is to review important advances in the
use of control-based approaches in the study of excitable
cells, especially neurons. In Section II, we review voltage-clamp
techniques, used for the last 60+ years to develop models of
voltage-sensitive behavior in excitable cells. In Section III, we
describe more recent dynamic-clamp techniques, which are used
to build model-based hypotheses into electrophysiological experiments. Section IV describes needed advances in dynamic
clamp, and Section V describes other emerging uses of real-time
(RT) control in electrophysiology and in the clinic. Although
the focus of the article is on cellular neurophysiology, we discuss several examples from cardiac electrophysiology and other
applications.

II. VOLTAGE-CLAMP TECHNIQUES
Although the field of neural electrophysiology is nearly
500 years old [1], it was not until the middle of the 20th century
that the mechanistic underpinnings of neuronal excitability were
determined. The technological driver of these advances was the
voltage-clamp method, an early and extremely influential form

of RT control in electrophysiology. In this section, we briefly
review the voltage-clamp technique as a necessary introduction
to several key topics. More extensive coverage of this material
can be found elsewhere [2]–[7].
Two key findings set the stage for developing a quantitative
theory that could account for generation of action potentials.
First, Cole and Curtis [8] demonstrated that the action potential
involves an increase in membrane permeability to ions. Second,
Hodgkin and Huxley [9] demonstrated, via intracellular recordings, that membrane potential overshoots 0 mV during the action
potential. Together, these findings suggested a model in which
membrane permeability to specific ions changed dynamically to
generate the action potential.
The necessary next step in this process was to develop a more
precise hypothesis, along with an appropriately controlled experiment to test it. Hypothesizing that membrane potential drives
changes in membrane permeability [2], Hodgkin and Huxley
adopted two techniques from Cole [10] and Marmont [11]: the
voltage-clamp and space-clamp methods.
The voltage-clamp technique involves using a feedback system to “clamp” membrane potential at a controllable value.
The Hodgkin–Huxley–Katz [12] form of this technology [see
Fig. 1(a)] uses two intracellular electrodes. Via the first electrode, a high-impedance “follower” circuit measures membrane
potential with unity gain. This signal is passed to a high-gain
feedback amplifier, designed to minimize the difference between
the measured voltage and a desired voltage “command” signal,
schematized in Fig. 1(a) as a square pulse from an external voltage source. This circuit passes current into the cell via a second
electrode, thus closing the feedback loop. Under perfect voltage
clamp, the time-dependent current generated by the feedback
amplifier exactly counterbalances the current flowing through
the membrane from biological sources. Consequently, one can
in theory measure voltage-controlled membrane currents simply
by monitoring the output current of the feedback amplifier.
To conduct a well-controlled voltage-clamp experiment, one
must also ensure that the interior space of the cell under study is
isopotential, or spaced-clamped. Without adequate space clamp,
the value of membrane potential at regions of the cell distant
from the voltage-measuring electrode is not controlled. Membrane currents from these unclamped regions can flow to the
current-passing site and distort voltage-clamp measurements
severely [13]. Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz [12] achieved space
clamp by winding the voltage-measuring and current-passing
electrodes in a double helix around a very thin glass filament
[see Fig. 1(a)].
Using voltage-clamp data collected under space-clamped
conditions, Hodgkin and Huxley [14] developed a simple,

powerful model of the unmyelinated axon. Fig. 1(b) shows this
model in the form of an electrical circuit. The model includes
the capacitance of the lipid bilayer (Cm ) in parallel with three
conductances. The nonlinear (voltage-dependent) conductances
GNa and GK are placed in series with the Nernst potentials for
Na+ and K+ ions, reflecting the fact that these conductances

are modeled as passing only Na+ and K+ , respectively. The linear conductance GL is in series with an empirically determined
battery EL . This conductance represents the weighted contributions of all voltage-independent conductances in the axon. The
current source Iapp signifies current injected via the electrode.
The first of the Hodgkin–Huxley equations simply represents

conservation of charge in this circuit:
Cm

dVm
= −[GNa (Vm − ENa ) + GK (Vm − EK )
dt
+ GL (Vm − EL )] + Iapp .

Much of the beauty of the Hodgkin–Huxley model comes
from the simple way in which the nonlinear conductances are
described. Each nonlinear conductance is described by one or
two gating variables, which represent (e.g.,) the proportion of
its maximal value that the conductance has attained. Hodgkin–
Huxley gating variables are each described by first-order, nonlinear differential equation of the form:
x∞ (Vm ) − x
dx
=
.
dt
τx (Vm )

(1)

In (1), the voltage-dependent function x∞ (Vm ) represents
the steady-state value of x at a given value of membrane potential Vm , and τx (Vm ) represents the time constant with which
x approaches that steady-state value. In the case of ideal voltage clamp of a space-clamped cell, (1) reduces to a first-order
differential equation with a simple exponential course from its
initial value x0 to its asymptotic value x∞ :
x(t) = x∞ − (x∞ − x0 )e−t/τ x .
Hodgkin–Huxley-style equations are readily solvable under
a number of conditions, including the absence of either space or
voltage clamp. In their original modeling paper [14], Hodgkin
and Huxley showed that their equations could replicate accurately the action potential at a point in space [see Fig. 1(c)]
and, more impressively, that the model accounted accurately
for the propagation speed of the action potential. These successful predictions are often credited as the crucial factors that
led to the 1963 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for this
team.
Left unknown by this wonderful work was the fundamental
source of voltage-gated and ligand-gated conductances in excitable cells. Early research suggested that ligand-gated conductance changes are generated as the sum of discrete events of size
10–100 nS, giving rise (with typical driving forces <100 mV)
to discrete changes in membrane current that are less than 10 pA
in amplitude [15]. Because cellular input resistances are typically relatively small (∼10–100 MΩ), measurement of 10-pA
events is prevented in most whole-cell preparations by thermal
(Johnson–Nyquist) noise, which is inversely proportional to the
input impedance of the source [16], [17].
To reduce levels of thermal noise and thus measure discrete
changes in membrane conductance, Nobel-Prize-winners Sakmann and Neher reasoned correctly that a very small conductance source with correspondingly high input resistance is required [18]. To this end, they developed so-called patch-clamp
methods [see Fig. 1(d)], in which a glass pipette of diameter
3–5 μm is lowered to the cell surface and forms an extremely
high (GΩ) resistance “seal” with the plasma membrane. The
underlying membrane can then be pulled off the cell surface to
create a current source with very high input resistance and, experience has shown, a small number of underlying ion channels.
Using the patch-clamp technique, along with improvements in

amplifier technology [19], allowed the group of Sakmann and
Neher to demonstrate that the cellular-level currents, measurable via previously developed voltage-clamp techniques, can
be ascribed to the summed activity of hundreds or thousands
of individual ion channels [see Fig. 1(e)]. Each of these channels flickers stochastically between open and closed states. The
voltage-dependent rate constants measurable at the whole-cell
level reflect the rates of transition between these open and closed
states [4], [7].
The techniques pioneered by these two Nobel-Prize-winning
groups have become standard techniques in cellular electrophysiology. Particularly widely used are two more recent variants of
these techniques:
1) In whole-cell patch clamp, the researcher creates the GΩ
seal as described by Sakmann and Neher, but then applies
suction to break through the cell membrane and give access to the cell as a whole. The whole-cell technique does
not allow observation of currents from single channels,
but it is a straightforward method to obtain high-quality
intracellular recordings from cells, even in the living
animal.
2) In single-electrode voltage clamp, one electrode is used
for the distinct purposes of measuring membrane potential Vm and passing current in order to control Vm . This
technique is experimentally valuable but has the down
side that measurement of Vm is distorted when passing
current through the tip of the pipette, which has nonzero
series resistance. A variety of clever techniques have been
developed to mitigate this and other problems associated
with real-world intracellular recordings [20].
Without question, the “commoditization” of voltage-clamp
techniques has been invaluable for our understanding of how
excitable cells function in health and disease [3], [21]. However, it is important to realize that all data are not of equal
quality. Compensation for electrode resistances and sources of
stray capacitance is necessarily incomplete for reasons related
to electrical stability of recorded signals [20]. This becomes
more of a problem as researchers record from deeper structures (increasing capacitance problems) with smaller (and thus
higher-resistance) pipettes (e.g., [22] and [23]). Additionally,
the whole-cell patch-clamp does not allow the researcher to
establish space clamp. To a degree, this problem can be mitigated by using pharmacological blockers to increase membrane
resistance and thus make the cell electrically more “compact”
[24]. However, because this approach does not by any means
guarantee good space clamp, voltage-clamp data from such
preparations should be expected to be significantly distorted
[13].
III. DYNAMIC CLAMP
Voltage-clamp techniques are a particularly valuable form
of control in cellular physiology, because they allow the researcher to control (clamp) membrane potential Vm , usually
in a step-wise fashion. With Vm held at a fixed value, the
Hodgkin–Huxley gating equation (1) is linear and gives rise to
a simple exponential solution. Newer, more complex forms of

BAUER et al.: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF REAL-TIME CONTROL IN CELLULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY

control, developed in the last 25 years, have allowed ever-more
sophisticated forms of hypothesis testing in electrically excitable
cells and circuits. In the cellular electrophysiology literature,
these techniques are generally referred to as dynamic conductance injection or, more commonly, dynamic clamp.
The goal of dynamic clamp techniques is to better study the
roles of quantitatively specified conductances, synaptic inputs,
and network structures on excitable cells. This objective is accomplished by constructing a system that can read instantaneous
values of membrane potential Vm , and operate on them to generate virtual currents to be delivered at appropriately high update
rates. Between the “reading” of Vm and the “writing” of applied current is an algorithm that represents any of a number
of membrane mechanisms and other factors. Dynamic clamp
is not a typical control method, because it does not impose a
particular behavior on the cell. Instead, dynamic clamp is a
method of studying the interactions between excitable cells and
a user-specified computational model in an experimental setting.
Dynamic clamp can, for example, replicate the actions of modeled voltage-gated ion channels in excitable cells, or immerse
those cells in virtual-reality-inspired neuronal networks. Thus,
dynamic clamp allows the researcher to test computationally
rigorous hypotheses in living cells.
Dynamic-clamp-like techniques were first used for simple
linear-resistive-coupling experiments in recordings from cardiomyocytes [25], [26] and neurons [27]. In 1993, two groups
launched more sophisticated dynamic-clamp technologies. The
system of Robinson and Kawai [28] relied upon digital-signalprocessing hardware to generate artificial synaptic inputs. An
MS-DOS-based system from the groups of Abbott and Marder
[29] was software-based, substantially expanding the number of
potential applications. However, because this system was programmed in assembly language, it was challenging for other
groups to adapt for new purposes.
In the 1990s, a number of approaches were taken to develop
ever-more-powerful dynamic-clamp systems. Masson et al., designed both a very large scale integration (VLSI) circuit and
a digital signal processor (DSP)-based system capable of imitating any type of membrane channel [30]. The VLSI model
was implemented using a customized application specific integrated circuit consisting of 45 CMOS and 75 bipolar transistors to simulate the activation and inactivation gating curves
for sodium from the Hodgkin–Huxley model. The DSP-based
system efficiently processed numerical data, but required a microcomputer for acquisition and storage of conductance values as well as the DSP board [30]. Like previous circuit-based
implementations [26], [27], the analog VLSI model neurons
and DSP-based systems also had the advantage of operating
without significant delays despite their complexity. However,
such circuits were only able to remain programmable and allow model changes through specialized construction, which increased the required number of components and system cost.
In 1996, Wilder et al. [31] developed the first MS-DOS system
based around a higher level language (Pascal). Through a series
of clever simplifications, they were able to use their system to
study two-cell networks consisting of one biological and one
simulated cardiomyocyte [32].

By the year 2000, personal computers were powerful enough
to support dynamic clamp systems written in somewhat humanfriendly programming languages on multitasking operating systems. Pinto et al., produced a Windows implementation which
required only a computer capable of running Windows and a
ADC/DAC interface for recording membrane potential and injecting current [33]. Similar Windows-based systems have followed [34]–[36]. However, the use of multitasking operating
systems like Windows for dynamic clamp raises the possibility of the disruption of the timing of dynamic-clamp operations [37], [38].
The ideal, software-based dynamic clamp system would allow
“hard” RT performance (i.e., consistent RT performance on each
cycle of input and output) with the conveniences of a multitasking operating system. Responding to this need, our group [39],
along with those of Christini (Weill Cornell, [40]) and Butera
(Georgia Tech, [41]) developed dynamic-clamp systems based
on RT versions of the Linux operating system. Recognizing
that the strengths of our three systems were complementary, we
subsequently merged them into a system we call the Real-Time
eXperiment Interface (RTXI; www.rtxi.org). RTXI [see
Fig. 2(a)] takes advantage of modified versions of the Linux
operating system that allow uninterruptible RT threads (processes) to be to created and run alongside a nonreal-time (NRT)
thread [42]. The RT thread performs all the time-sensitive data
movement and mathematical operations, and communicates
with the data-acquisition (DAQ) board. The DAQ, in turn, communicates with a current-clamp amplifier, digitizing measured
membrane potential at a fixed frequency (usually 10–75 kHz)
and at the same frequency delivering a signal that is converted
by the amplifier to current injected into the cell via the recording
electrode, typically under whole-cell patch-clamp. For a given
computer, the RT thread must run fast enough to “read” the value
of membrane potential and update the applied current within one
clock cycle of the DAQ card.
The NRT thread represents the processes that operate on
slower time scales. A graphical user interface allows the user to
update model parameters. Changes made in the NRT thread are
sent to the RT thread where they are incorporated into the thread
on the next data acquisition board trigger [42]. RTXI includes
several standard features or plug-ins, as well as the ability to
incorporate any additional user-made plug-ins [see Fig. 2(a)].
Dynamic data obtained by the RT thread from the cell or calculated in RT from cellular data may be passed from the RT thread
to the NRT thread. They are sent to first in first out queues
which allowed the data to be recorded or displayed using the
virtual oscilloscope or data recorder features. Additional features included a system control panel designed to configure data
acquisition devices and a connector used to make connections
between user written plug-ins and the data acquisition device.
RTXI is able to interface with multiple DAQs and dynamically
link any user-written plug-ins at run time [42].
As noted previously, dynamic clamp has been used for many
applications [37], [38]. One common use involves injecting
voltage-dependent conductances into the patched area of the
cell [see Fig. 2(c)]. In this case, the dynamic clamp system
reads membrane voltage Vm , calculates the associated value of

information. The real-time thread is uninterruptable to ensure real-time performance. (b) Dynamic clamp is often used to introduce a virtual conductance source
into a cell membrane at the location of the electrode. This conductance is injected as a current and may be modeled as a series conductance and reversal potential,
connected in parallel with existing biological membrane conductances at the site of the electrode. (c) Left panel: A neuronal action potential, recorded intracellularly
under control conditions. Right Panel: With time steps of 12.5 μs, RTXI is fast enough to replicate, with reasonable accuracy, the actions of previously blocked,
fast-inactivating Na+ channels in generating action potentials [66]. (d) Power spectral densities of spike trains show that 3–8 Hz interspike intervals are eliminated
with the use of conductance-based synaptic activity delivered with dynamic clamp, but preserved with current-based inputs [58]. (e) A hybrid model/neuron circuit

conductance from Hodgkin–Huxley-style equations, and multiplies conductance by the potential difference Vm − Erev , where
Erev is the reversal potential of the modeled conductance.
This current is then injected into the cell, creating a serial
conductance-reversal potential network which combines in parallel with the conductances already present within the cell [see
Fig. 2(b)]. This approach allows users to temporarily embed virtual ion channels in the cell membrane, and record the response.
Virtual ion channels can be of the Hodgkin–Huxley type, or
can take more complex forms that include stochastic channel
flicker [43]. Such experiments allow the researcher to evaluate the relationship between channel properties and emergent
cellular outputs with much greater speed and flexibility than is
allowed with traditional molecular biological approaches.

In a complementary approach, dynamic clamp can be used to
subtract a voltage-dependent conductance. In this case, negativeconductance channels are added to counteract the presence of
biological channels in the membrane [44]–[46]. In this kind of
experiment, particular care is required. It is not a trivial matter
to effectively cancel a biological nonlinear conductance, and
control experiments must be performed to ensure that the results
are correct.
Dynamic clamp also provides the user with unique ways to
quantify input–output relationships in response to user-defined
inputs [47]–[57]. In one such example, Fernandez and White
[58] used dynamic clamp to compare the responses of suspected oscillatory neurons (entorhinal stellate cells) to artificial
synaptic stimuli of two kinds. For current-based stimuli, the

BAUER et al.: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF REAL-TIME CONTROL IN CELLULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY

stimulus waveform was independent of membrane potential. For
more realistic, conductance-based stimuli, input scaled instantaneously with membrane potential as described in the previous
paragraph. Use of conductance-based synaptic inputs substantially altered the power spectrum of the resulting output spike
train [see Fig. 2(d)], arguing against the common hypothesis
that stellate cells serve as pacemakers for prominent synchronized in vivo activity at 4–12 Hz [58]. Other recent work from
our group show that stellate cells are better poised to serve as
amplifiers of synchronized activity that is received from other
neuronal populations [59]–[61].
Dynamic clamp can also be used to couple biological cells together via artificial, and thus user-controllable, synapses. Such
hybrid networks can in principle contain a fair number of biological cells—the number is limited by intracellular recording capabilities—along with an arbitrary number of simulated
virtual neurons. In early work of this kind, analog circuitry
was used to artificially connect excitable myocytes or neurons [26], [27]. Since then, a number of flexible hardwareand software-based systems have been developed for such studies [28], [29], [33], [39], [41], [42], [62]. In one hybrid-network
example, Wang et al. built hybrid networks to study the effects of conduction delay on neuronal synchronization [63].
Using dynamic clamp to alter the apparent conduction delay
between recorded neurons, they found that biologically relevant
delays can have profound effects on the stability of oscillatory
synchrony. An example of this effect is shown in Fig. 2(e),
which shows results from a hybrid network of two biological neurons, connected via virtual inhibition. The plot shows
the time lag between action potentials for the two cells, normalized by their firing periods, plotted versus normalized time
delay. For small delays, the two cells fire in near-antiphase
(normalized time lag near 0.5). For larger delays, the cells
switch into near-synchronous firing (normalized time lag near
0 or 1) [63].
A particularly imaginative example of dynamic-clamp technology comes from the work of Berecki et al. [64]. They simultaneously recorded from two cells: a ventricular myocyte and
a human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell. In their experiments,
membrane potential from the myocyte was recorded and used
as a variable voltage-clamp input to the HEK cell, which had
been transfected to express a particular variant of K+ channels in
either wild-type or mutated form. The current generated by the
K+ channels was recorded and injected back into the myocyte.
In effect, the transfected HEK cell was used as a biological
element to solve the associated Hodgkin–Huxley-style gating
differential equation (1). This approach allowed the authors to
assess the effects of channel mutations on myocyte physiology
without the intermediate step of constructing the differentialequation-based model.
Like most experimental techniques, the dynamic clamp
method has potential weaknesses. Some of these weaknesses
apply only to specific platforms. For example:
1) Hardware-based dynamic clamp systems are very fast but
relatively limited in their programmability.
2) As noted previously, some software-based systems do not
ensure “hard” real-time performance.

1453

3) All software-based systems running on traditional PCs
face several design limitations. First, software-based systems require nonzero time steps in order to perform the
real-time calculations. Second, there is small (∼5 μs) but
measurable jitter (variability) in the time step, generated
by the computer bus [39], [41]. Third, within each time
step, there is some latency between the operation of “reading” membrane potential and “writing” applied current.
Fourth, the number of bits in A/D and D/A conversion
can limit system dynamic range to a degree that degrades
performance [41]. In most cases, RTXI and other softwarebased systems run fast enough to make the effects of these
issues negligible [39], [65]. However, in demanding applications, the effects of time step, jitter, and latency can
be important [41], [66], [67].
Some of the more vexing issues that one must consider in
designing, performing, and interpreting dynamic clamp experiments are common to all platforms:
1) Model error is inevitable and leads to inexact outcomes.
For example, in Fig. 2(c), the mimicked action potential
(right) is measurably different from the control version
(left). Some of this discrepancy is surely caused by inaccuracies in the real-time gating equations.
2) Another source of model error is perhaps more important:
unless the cell is space-clamped, and thus isopotential, it
is impossible to use a point source to represent voltageor ligand-gated channels that are widely distributed on
the cell membrane. This factor is no doubt an additional
source of error in the right panel of Fig. 2(c).
3) In most cases, dynamic clamp is performed using a single
electrode to measure membrane potential Vm and inject
calculated current Iapp . As noted earlier, the use of a single electrode gives rise to unavoidable inaccuracies, due to
imperfect compensation for the electrode series resistance
and capacitance. These imperfections place significant
limits on dynamic-clamp performance [67]. This problem is particularly acute under two extremes of recording conditions: recording from very small cells or processes, with correspondingly small-diameter patch electrodes; and recording from very large cells, for which so
much current is needed that electrode or amplifier properties can be limiting.
4) In dynamic clamp, charge is passed to the recorded cell
via the electrode. The chemical identities of the mimicked
ions are not respected. For this reason, dynamic clamp
cannot replicate the effects of ions like calcium on secondmessenger systems.
IV. EMERGING ADVANCES IN DYNAMIC CLAMP
Control-based approaches have been important in cellular
electrophysiology for 60+ years. Two examples were discussed
here: voltage-clamp techniques, which revolutionized our understanding of cellular electrophysiology, and much more recent
dynamic-clamp approaches, which have allowed virtual-realityinspired techniques to understand cells and networks. However,
as described at the end of the previous section, many challenges

1454

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MAY 2014

remain. Here, we discuss methods to mitigate these issues, in
the same order:
1) Model error is a reasonably tractable problem if two conditions are met. First, there must be control data, so that the
model can be optimized to fit the control case. Second, the
membrane mechanism should be electronically very near
the location of the electrode. Given the speed of modern
computers, and the relatively small number of free parameters for most models of membrane mechanisms, one
could “tune” the model to better-match the control data in
relatively short order.
2) Distributed virtual conductances present a major problem. One can attempt to overcome this error source by
building a model that includes “virtual” extensions (e.g.,
dendrites or axons in neurons) and spatially distributed
sources [36], [45]. Inaccuracies in these virtual extensions
can in principle be corrected via optimization, given a
sufficiently constrained model.
3) Compensation for electrode properties can be performed
in software, under the assumption that the electrode has
linear properties [68]. Because this compensation involves
deconvolution to remove the low-pass effects of uncompensated resistance and capacitance, it is challenging but
tractable to perform in practice. Such deconvolution methods make it feasible to introduce artificial membrane
mechanisms at locations other than the neuronal cell body.
4) Idoux and Mertz [69] pioneered a method to “clamp” calcium, using a feedback-controlled laser to release chemically bound calcium that had been previously introduced
to the cell. Although the fidelity of measurement and
uncaging techniques make this approach challenging, we
see this as an extremely promising research path, given
the importance of the spatiotemporal signature of the calcium transient for cellular metabolism in both myocytes
and neurons (e.g., [70]–[72]).
V. FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Although we have focused on cellular electrophysiology,
mainly in the realm of neurophysiology, it bears mentioning
that feedback-based techniques are useful in many other realms
of biomedical engineering. Feedback-based devices are emerging as an important frontier for systems-level applications like
seizure control [73], [74], deep brain stimulation [75], [76], and
cardiac arrhythmias [77], [78]. Some, but not all, of these applications can make use of the submillisecond timing necessary
for dynamic clamp. RT control is also emerging as an important topic in automated, optimized experimental design [79]
and in the particularly challenging field of virtual acoustic realities [80]. In the decades to come, we anticipate that feedbackbased experimental design will become ubiquitous in basic and
applied studies of many stripes.
