Abstract—Goal: We applied a low-intensity pulsed transcranial
ultrasound stimulation (pTUS) to the ischemic cortex after a distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) to study whether
pTUS is capable of protecting brain from ischemic injury. Methods: Rats were randomly assigned to Sham (n = 6), Control (n
= 16), and pTUS (n = 16) groups. The pTUS-treated rats were
subjected to 60-min ultrasonic stimulation immediately after the
ischemia. After 48 h, the sensorimotor-related behavioral outcomes
were assessed by a neurological severity score (NSS), and the permanent brain injury was assessed by the histologic analysis of TTC
staining of brain slices. Results: pTUS group showed significantly
lower NSS (n = 10, 5.5 ± 2.5) than the Control group (n = 10,
10.5 ± 1.4) ( p < 0.01). Concordantly, the ischemic lesion was
significantly reduced after receiving pTUS immediately after dMCAO. The cortical infarct volume in the control group was more
than threefold of the pTUS group (43.39% ± 2.33%, n = 16 versus 13.78% ± 8.18%, n = 16, p < 0.01). Immunohistochemical
staining indicated reduction of neutrophils in the affected area,
and laser speckle imaging showed significant increase of a cerebral
blood flow after pTUS, which consistently supported the neuroprotection of pTUS in ischemic brain injury. Conclusion: Both
behavior and histological results suggested that pTUS on ischemic
core immediately after ischemic stroke could be neuroprotective.
Significance: The noninvasiveness and high spatiotemporal resolution of pTUS makes it a unique neuromodulation technique in
comparison with the current TMS and tDCS.
Index Terms—Distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO), rehabilitation, stroke, transcranial ultrasound stimulation,

mechanically, electrically, or magnetically by sensory stimulation [4]–[6], transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) [1], or
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) [7], [8]. The stimulation could start immediately after the stroke, or at the rehabilitation stage [4]. The possible underlying mechanisms for such
stimulation-based therapeutics might be relevant to the restoration of the balance of interhemispheric inhibition [7], [9]. Recent
in vivo experiments have shown that low-frequency (<0.7MHz)
pulsed ultrasound could be reliably transmitted through the skull
to stimulate the neurons [10], [11]. By carefully selecting the
ultrasonic parameters, the low-intensity pulsed transcranial ultrasound stimulation (pTUS) could cause either excitatory or
inhibitory neural activities [12]–[17]. For instance, electromyograms (EMG) and muscle contractions can be observed responding to excitatory pTUS of a motor cortex [13], [17], and the
magnitude of the P30 VEP component could be reduced by
inhibitory pTUS [14]. Previous studies [12]–[17] showed that
shorter duration pulses of TUS could activate, whereas longer
pulses TUS were able to suppress the neural activity. Though
the underlying mechanisms are not yet very clear, pTUS is regarded as a promising noninvasive neural modulation method,
which is complementary to TMS and tDCS. In this study, we hypothesize that excitatory pTUS on ischemic core immediately
after the stroke could protect the brain from ischemic injury.
We, therefore, designed a low-intensity pTUS system to stimulate the ischemic cortex in a rat model of distal middle cerebral
artery occlusion (dMCAO). The neuroprotection of pTUS would
be evaluated by neurologic severity score (NSS) of the motor
behavior, as well as the histologic analysis of brain slices. In
addition, two more experiments would be conducted to investigate the possible mechanisms of the neuroprotection of pTUS
in an ischemic brain injury.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. pTUS System
The pTUS system for this study was illustrated in Fig. 1,
consisting of four major components: 1) signal generator module (AFG3022B, Tektronix, USA), 2) custom-designed radio
frequency (RF) amplifier module (Custom HGX100, continuously adjustable gain up to 100 W, Nanjing, China), 3) a
single-element immersion-type planar transducer (V301, Olympus, USA) driven by the RF amplifier, and 4) an acoustic collimator (d = 7 mm) coupled to the transducer for collimating and
delivering the pTUS.

the potential influences of anesthetics. 2) dMCAO-pTUS group
(n = 16), in which the rats were treated with pTUS immediately after the dMCAO for 60 min, and 3) Sham group (n =
6) that received the same surgical procedures except dMCAO.
The surgical procedures of dMCAO have been well documented
in the literature [20], [21]. The animals were anesthetized [22]
with isoflurane (5% initial, and 1.0–1.5% for maintenance) and
intubated with 2/3 N2 and 1/3 O2 throughout the experiment
up to ∼2 h till the completion of pTUS. The rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at 37.0 ± 0.2 °C with a
heating pad and DC control module (FHC Inc., Bowdoin, ME,
USA) throughout the experiment. Focal ischemia was induced
by occluding the bilateral common carotid arteries for 30 min
combined with permanent occlusion of the left distal middle
cerebral artery above the rhinal fissure. After 48 h [20], NSS
was evaluated before the rat was euthanized for the histologic
analysis.
D. Neurobehavioral Examination

B. pTUS Parameters
In this study, we tested the 0.5-MHz pTUS with different parameters [i.e., the number of acoustic cycles per pulse (NC),
pulse repetition frequency (PRF), spatial-average temporalaverage intensity (ISATA ), the number of tone bursts (NTB)]
from an immersion-type planar transducer, and we could observe evident motor outputs and EMG signals (noncollimated:
NC = 200, PRF = 1.5 kHz, NTB = 200, ISATA : 57 mW/cm2 ;
collimated: NC = 200, PRF = 1.5 kHz, NTB = 200, ISATA : 86
mW/cm2 ) in a rat experiment (see the Supplementary Video). In
stroke experiments, 360 trials (sonication duration for each trial:
0.4 s, intertrial interval: 10 s) of collimated pTUS were delivered
immediately to stimulate the ischemic core after the dMCAO,
and NTB was set to 600 in order to increase the sonication time.
The sonication site was illustrated in Fig. 1(a). To assess the
thermal effect of ultrasound on brain tissues, we estimated the
temperature change according to the thermal mechanism and
absorption properties of ultrasound in brain tissues for shortexposure time of ultrasound sonication [18]. We concluded a
rise of less than 0.01 °C for the above frequency and intensity in
60 min of stimulation in our experiments. Details of the thermal
effect are described in Appendix A.

In order to assess the neurological deficits in motor, sensory,
and balance functions, a well-trained examiner who was blind
to the experimental groups tested the behavior of the animals
before the surgery and 48 hr after dMCAO. Behavioral performances were evaluated according to a set of NSS (0: normal; 18:
maximal deficit) modified from [23], which, respectively, evaluated the deficits in motor, sensory, reflex, and balance functions
after the neurological injury (see Appendix B).
E. Histology
After the second behavioral test, the rats were euthanized with
an overdose of isoflurane anesthesia. The brain was carefully
removed, and sectioned into slices of 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 (mm) along
the coronal plane. The brain slices were incubated in 2, 3, 5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, 2%, Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) at ∼37 °C for 15 min in dark [24]. The brain sections were
then fixed by immersion in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution
overnight. The area of infarction in both hemispheres on each
section was measured by the image analysis (Imaging J, version
1.61, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) of the brain slices. The infarct
volume of each slice was measured by the ratio of overall infarct
area over the affected hemisphere on both sides, then the infarct
volume of each rat was estimated with the average of all six
slices [20], [21].

C. Experimental Procedures for pTUS Neuroprotection
All surgical procedures and experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee and the Ethics Committee of Med-X Research Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In this study, we adopted
a dMCAO model in rats for its high stability in infarct volume
[19]. Thirty-eight male Sprague Dawley rats (300 ± 20 g, Slac
Laboratory Animal, Shanghai, China) were randomly separated
into: 1) dMCAO-control group (n = 16), in which the animals
were subjected to standard dMCAO injury without any ultrasound interventions. These rats were anesthetized up to ∼2 h
following the same protocols as the pTUS group considering

F. Imaging the pTUS-Induced Cerebral Blood Flow
(CBF) Change
In order to study the influence of pTUS on hemodynamics,
we performed another experiment to study the CBF change in
response to the pTUS by a laser speckle imaging (LSI) [25].
Nine male Sprague–Dawley rats (300 ± 20 g) were used in
this experiment. To avoid the interference with the CBF imaging, we stimulated the same area as the pTUS-treated group
but positioned the transducer and collimator laterally on the
skull. We tested three blocks (12 trials each) with different number of tone bursts (NTB = 600, 800, and 1000) and the same

2354

frequency and PRF as the above stroke experiment. The intertrial interval was 2 min, and the interblock interval was 10 min.
The raw laser speckle images were recorded for 20 s, including
4-s baseline, 0.40–0.67-s pTUS, and approximate 16 s of poststimulation. ISAPA of the pTUS in CBF study was 2.155 W/cm2 ,
and the corresponding ISATA for NTB = 600, 800, 1000 were
43, 57, and 72 mW/cm2 , respectively, which were all under the
threshold for generating significant thermal effect or cavitational
damage to brain tissues. Nevertheless, it might have potential
risk of hemorrhage for those unhealthy vessels. Techniques for
monitoring CBF change by LSI were detailed in our previous
work [25].
G. Immunohistochemical Staining
In order to investigate whether the neuroprotection of pTUS
was relevant to the reduction of inflammatory response, we performed a group of immunohistochemical experiment (n = 12).
The infiltration of neutrophil from peripheral blood was examined by 3, 3’-Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride dehydrate
(DAB) staining. Rat brains were frozen in –80-°C isopentane
immediately after euthanatizing the animal, and then were sectioned into a thickness of 20 μm. All slices were then treated
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by incubation in
0.3% TritonX-100 (dissolved in the phosphate buffered saline)
for another 10 min. After that brain slices were sequentially
blocked with a 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (dissolved in methanol)
for 30 min, and diluted normal serum (ABC Kit, Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 1 h, followed by the incubation
with antibody against Myeloperoxidase (MPO) (1:300 dilution,
R&D system, Minneapolis, MN, USA) overnight at 4 °C. After
treated with biotinylated second antibody and incubated with
ABC reagent (ABC Kit, Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA,
USA), brain slices were reacted with substrate DAB containing hydrogen peroxide (Peroxide substrate Kit, Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), and then stained by hematoxylin.
MPO positive signals were counted in three 5× microscopic
fields.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Both pTUS and control groups showed significant deficit of
neurological functions after dMCAO compared with the Sham
rats. Furthermore, pTUS group performed much better than
the control group with almost 50% improvement in aspect of
NSS [control: 10.5 ± 1.4; pTUS: 5.5 ± 2.5; p < 0.01, n =
10; see Fig. 2(a)], indicating the significantly neuroprotective
effect of pTUS. Concordantly, the infarct volume was more than
threefold in control animals without pTUS treatment [control:
43.39% ± 2.33%; pTUS: 13.78% ± 8.18%, p < 0.01, n = 16;
see Fig. 2(b) and (c)].
Due to the technical limitations, we were not able to simultaneously monitor the CBF as the collimator of the pTUS was
perpendicularly fixed above the cortex, as we did in above stroke
group. Therefore, we simply stimulated the overall somatosensory cortex when the animals were anesthetized without dMCAO. Fig. 3 showed the dynamic change of CBF in the target cortex starting from 4 s before pTUS until 16 s after the

stimulation. Average CBF over all subjects are presented as a
percent of baseline (mean ± S.D.) at each second. Baseline
CBF was defined as the average during the 4 s before pTUS.
A rise of CBF was observed immediately after the pTUS
started, which reached the maximum, i.e., 103.36% ± 2.38%,
104.15% ± 2.56%, 105.93% ± 3.21%, respectively, around
the 5 s in three blocks. After that the CBF stayed at a significantly high level up to 12 s after the stimulation (paired
t-test with a baseline at every imaging time point, ∗ : p < 0.05,
∗∗
: p < 0.01). Noted that the NTB = 1000 used in this study
could induce a maximal increase of CBF, while the response to
the NTB = 800 would last for the longest time. Furthermore, the

infiltration of neutrophil from peripheral blood was examined
by immunohistochemical staining. The infiltrating neutrophils
through the impaired brain blood barrier release inflammatory
factors, such as iNOS, NADPH oxidase, MPO, MMP-8, MMP9, elastase, and cathepsins, which would aggravate the reaction
of inflammation, and further damage the neurons in the penumbra region. Fig. 4 illustrated that the number of neutrophils in
penumbra 24 h after the dMCAO. Three regions of interest
(ROI) [see Fig. 4(c)], covering the lateral striatum and a part of
ischemic cortex, were selected from each slice for further quantitative analysis. The total number of neutrophils in all ROIs
[see Fig. 4(d)] in the dMCAO-pTUS group [41 ± 6, p < 0.01, n
= 6, Fig. 4(b)] showed a significant decrease compared with the
dMCAO-control group [95 ± 22, p < 0.01, n = 6, Fig. 4(a)],
implying less inflammation in the brain after pTUS.
Noted that an ultrasound-based treatment has shown therapeutic potential in an acute kidney ischemic injury possibly by
stimulating a splenic anti-inflammatory pathway [26]. A battery
of biochemical changes could happen in permeability of cell
membranes [27]. Moreover, it has been proposed that pTUS
might promote 1) the synthesis of proteins associated with antiinflammation so as to reduce the inflammatory response of
biological tissue [28]. In this study, we also found significant
reduction of neutrophils in affected area that might lead to less
injury, however, it possibly could be due to other factors, e.g.,
the treated animals might have less damage of the blood brain
barrier and, therefore, less invasion of neutrophils. 2) The activation of the synthesis of nitric oxide [29] that promotes the
perfusion of ischemic tissue. In this study, we observed a significant increase of CBF after pTUS, which could be neuroprotective in ischemia brain injury. Nevertheless, there also could
be some other factors that may contribute to the neuroprotective pTUS, e.g., enhanced GABA or inhibition of Glutamate
as demonstrated in other neuromodulation techniques including

2355

TMS [30] and cathodal tDCS [8], [31]. Further studies are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms for neuroprotection
by pTUS. It should also be noted that in 2002 Daffertshofer and
colleagues [32] reported the facilitation of ultrasound stimulation for enhancing the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator; however, ultrasound stimulation alone did not demonstrate
effective neuroprotection in their study, which might be due to
different TUS parameters or time window.
Acoustic waves can interact with tissue through either thermal
or nonthermal effect. The thermal effect is due to the absorption of the ultrasound in the tissue, which depends not only
on the tissue properties (e.g., absorption coefficient, density,
perfusion, etc.), but also on the parameters of pTUS (e.g., frequency, pressure amplitude, pulse duration, PRF, etc.) [33]. The
ultrasound power in this study was measured by a radiation
force balance system (RFB-2000, Onda, Corp., Sunnyvale, CA,
USA) with spatial average pulse average intensity (ISAPA ) of
2.155 W/cm2 and spatial average temporal average intensity
(ISATA ) of 86 mW/cm2 . The attenuation of ultrasound through
the skin, skull, and dura of mice was <10% [13]; we, therefore,
used the maximal value of (ISATA ) in the temperature estimation, and theoretical calculations showed that thermal effect of
pTUS was negligible in this study (< 0.01 °C; see the estimation
in Appendix A). Therefore, we attributed the neuroprotection
of pTUS to other nonthermal effects of ultrasound. The most
widely studied nonthermal effect is the acoustic cavitation, including inertial cavitation (also called transient cavitation) and
noninertial cavitation (also called stable cavitation). Cavitation
of ultrasound may result in a variety of biological changes,
which depends not only on the tissue properties, but also on the
ultrasound parameters [18], [33]. In “gas body” rich tissues, literatures only reported cavitational damage when the ultrasonic
pressure was greater than 2 MPa [12], [33]. While in the tissues with few “gas bodies” (e.g., the brain tissue in this study),
cavitation-induced damage rarely happens when the ultrasonic
pressure was less than 40 MPa [12], [33]. For low-frequency
(0.44–0.67 MHz) and low-intensity (temporal average intensity
(ITA ): 30–500 mW/cm2 )) ultrasound, it was reported that even
much longer (36–48 h) stimulation would not alter the neuronal
membranes [12]. Therefore, the short-time (ࣈ144 s effective exposure) pTUS (<1 MPa) in this study was not likely to induce
cavitational damage to brain tissues.
Low-frequency and low-intensity pTUS could be reliably
transmitted through skull to activate or inhibit the neurons [12],
[13], without evident thermal effect. Such a new neuromodulation technique can be used to selectively stimulate the cortex
[14] or nerve [16], and successfully elicit [14], [16], or inhibit
[14], [15] the motor responses. The inhibitory or excitatory
modulation of the neural activity would not only depend on the
parameters of ultrasound, e.g., the frequency (F), intensity [e.g.,
spatial-peak temporal-average intensity (ISPTA ), or spatial-peak
pulse-average intensity (ISPPA )], the number of acoustic cycles
per pulse (NC), and PRF, but also the ultrasound beam, e.g.,
focused or collimated ultrasound. So far, it has been reported a
wide range of effective focused or collimated ultrasound in the
literature [12]–[17]. In this study, we selected the parameters
according to the existing literature and our test experiments (see

the Supplementary Video). Systematic study on the effect of
the pTUS parameters is absent in this research, which is still an
important issue open for further investigation.
Due to technical limitations, we were not able to simultaneously monitor the CBF when the collimator of the pTUS was
perpendicularly fixed above the cortex in dMCAO experiment.
Thus, we could not record CBF when applying pTUS to the
overall somatosensory cortex in the dMCAO stroke experiment.
As a result, in the CBF experiment on the rats without stroke,
although we could observe a significant rise of CBF when the
pTUS was applied laterally, yet it was not a direct evidence that
pTUS could promote the CBF in the ischemic cortex. Besides,
since the collimator size (7 mm) was smaller than the lesion area
in the control group in this study, we might expect to observe
a better recovery with a larger TUS collimator. The size of the
stimulation area is another important issue to be further studied.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this study, we reported the significant neuroprotection of
low-intensity pTUS immediately after ischemic stroke in a distal
MCAO model. Optical imaging implied that the low-intensity
pTUS could promote the CBF. Meanwhile, immunohistochemical staining indicated the promotion of antiinflammatory factors

in the pTUS-treated brain, which represented functional amelioration in ischemic cortex. The safety of the pTUS on brain tissue
was also analyzed. The noninvasiveness and high spatiotemporal resolution of pTUS makes it a unique neuromodulation
technique in comparison with current TMS and tDCS. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to clarify the underlying
mechanisms of the neuroprotection in ischemic brain injury and
optimize the ultrasound parameters of pTUS.
