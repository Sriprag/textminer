Abstract—The superconducting magnet with a high magnetic
force field can levitate diamagnetic materials. In this study, a specially designed superconducting magnet with large gradient high
magnetic field (LGHMF), which provides three apparent gravity
levels (μg, 1 g, and 2 g), was used to study its influence on receptor
activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast
differentiation from preosteoclast cell line RAW264.7. The effects
of LGHMF on the viability, nitric oxide (NO) production, morphology in RAW264.7 cells were detected by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method, the Griess
method, and the immunofluorescence staining, respectively. The
changes induced by LGHMF in osteoclast formation, mRNA
expression, and bone resorption were determined by tartrateresistant acid phosphatase staining, semiquantity PCR, and bone
resorption test, respectively. The results showed that: 1) LGHMF
had no lethal effect on osteoclast precursors but attenuated NO
release in RAW264.7 cells. 2) Diamagnetic levitation (μg) enhanced both the formation and bone resorption capacity of osteoclast. Moreover, diamagnetic levitation up-regulated mRNA
expression of RANK, Cathepsin K, MMP-9, and NFATc1, while
down-regulated RunX2 in comparison with controls. Furthermore,
diamagnetic levitation induced obvious morphological alterations
in osteoclast, including active cytoplasmic peripheral pseudopodial expansion, formation of pedosome belt, and aggregation of
actin ring. 3) Magnetic field produced by LGHMF attenuated osteoclast resorption activity. Collectively, LGHMF with combined
effects has multiple effects on osteoclast, which attenuated osteoclast resorption with magnetic field, whereas promoted osteoclast
differentiation with diamagnetic levitation. Therefore, these findings indicate that diamagnetic levitation could be used as a novel
ground-based microgravity simulator, which facilitates bone cell
research of weightlessness condition.
Index Terms—Bone resorption, diamagnetic levitation, large
gradient high magnetic field (LGHMF), nitric oxide (NO), osteoclast differentiation.

I. INTRODUCTION
HE magnetic field ranges from Earth’s natural geomagnetic field to man-made high magnetic fields (HMFs) is
playing a pivotal role in various aspects of modern society including navigation, medical application, and scientific research.
With the aid of superconducting magnetic-produced large gradient high magnetic field (LGHMF), stable levitation of diamagnetic materials has become available including cells, tissues, and
animal models [1]. Thus, the magnetic body force generated by
LGHMF can therefore be used to simulate different apparent
gravities, which is one of the most promising ground-based
tools to realize virtual microgravity conditions on earth [2], [3].
Previous publications show that LGHMF has been widely used
to investigate the effects of microgravity on different systems
consisting of mice, water drops, insects, plants, frogs, and mammalian cells [2]–[11]. Moreover, our lab has also reported that
superconducting magnets-produced LGHMF, affects various aspects of bone cells including survival, morphology, cytoskeleton architecture, and function [12]–[22]. Therefore, diamagnetic
levitation could be a suitable ground-based platform to study the
gravitational bioeffects.
Osteoclasts are unique bone-resorbing cells derived from
monocyte/macrophage lineage that function most effectively as
multinucleated cells. The process of osteoclast differentiation
from osteoclast precursors involves the stimulation of cytokine
factor receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL),
and the expression of several genes that together identify cells
of osteoclast lineage, including receptor activator of NF-κB
(RANK), tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), matrix
metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9), Cathepsin K, runt-related gene 2
(Runx2), and nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1
(NFATc1) [23], [24]. Recently, nitric oxide (NO) is found to
enhance osteoclast formation in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by mediating cell fusion [25], implying a positive role
of NO in osteoclast formation.
It is now well established that enhanced osteoclastogenesis
plays an important role for osteoporosis [26]. Indeed, emerging
evidence implies that osteoclast belongs to the direct target for
microgravity and mechanical forces [27]–[29]. Hence, studies
focusing on osteoclast differentiation under microgravity conditions is of great importance as a promising way to elucidate
the detailed mechanism underlying microgravity-induced bone
loss [24], [30]. In the present study, the effects of LGHMF on
RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation were investigated.
Moreover, cell viability, NO release, arrangement of cell cytoskeleton actin, osteoclast gene expression, and bone degrade
capacity in osteoclastic differentiation of RAW264.7 cells were

also assessed. Furthermore, aside from the influence of LGHMF
on osteoclast differentiation, we also evaluated the recovery
ability of osteoclast from LGHMF exposure, which in our study
cells were treated with LGHMF for 48 h followed by culturing
back to normal environment for another 48 h. These findings of
LGHMF, especially diamagnetic levitation-caused alterations in
these characteristics for osteoclast differentiation will enhance
our understanding for the application of diamagnetic levitation
into bone cell study, and will also provide new evidence for
the recovery process of osteoclastogenesis from diamagnetic
levitation.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Reagents
Fetal bovine serum (FBS), α-MEM, SuperScript III RTPCR System, penicillin G sodium, streptomycin, rhodamineconjugated phalloidin, goat antimouse rhodamine-IgG and 4’,6Diamidino-2-phenylindole were acquired from Life Science
(USA). Griess was purchased from Sigma (USA). Cell culture
dishes, 96-stripwell plates, and Corning Osteo Assay Surface
96-well plates were obtained from Corning (USA). RANKL
was acquired from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN 55412,
USA). RNeasy Kit was provided by Qiagen (Hilder, Germany).
4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)
and TRAP staining kit were from Sigma (USA). Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was purchased from Sangon (Shanghai, China).
All other reagents were acquired from commercial sources.
B. Cell Culture
RAW264.7 cells were obtained from the Cell Bank of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were
maintained in minimal essential medium alpha modification (αMEM) containing 10% FBS 100 unit/mL penicillin G sodium,
100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 292 μg/mL L-glutamine (Life
Science, USA). Cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 .
C. Superconducting Magnet
An experimental platform for diamagnetic levitation of biological system has been described in detail by the authors [31].
Briefly, a superconducting magnet [JMTA-16T50MF; Japan Superconductor Technology, Inc. (JASTEC), Tokyo, Japan], which
can produce a LGHMF, was made by JASTEC. The superconducting magnet can provide three different magnetic force fields
[B (dB/dz)] of −1370, 0, and 1370 T2 /m in a room temperature
bore with 51-mm diameter, corresponding to two magnetic induction intensities (12, 16, and 12 T) and three apparent body
force levels (μg, 1g, and 2 g), respectively [14]. A series of
equipment was developed to perform the biological experiment,
including an observing system, a gas control system, a temperature control system, and an object stage. In the present study,
four groups were set, namely control group (1 g, geomagnetic
field, 0 T2 / m), μg group (12 T, – 1370 T2 /m), 1 g group (16 T,
0 T2 /m), and 2 g group (12 T, 1370 T2 /m).

For exposing the RAW264.7 cells to the superconducting
magnet, the cells were cultured in 96-stripwell plates or 35mm tissue culture dishes. The α-MEM medium was added with
25-mM HEPES to maintain the pH value. In the present study,
cells were maintained in different apparent gravity (μg, 1 g, and
2 g) conditions generated by LGHMF. Because the diamagnetic
levitation we used is a compound environment consisted of
low apparent gravity and strong magnetic field, the influence of
magnetic field could thus be evaluated by comparing the 1 g with
control groups. And the influences of apparent gravity changes
could be assessed through comparison between the μg and 2 g
groups, where the magnetic field intensity in these two groups
is both 12 T.
In order to investigate the effects of LGHMF on osteoclast,
cells were incubated under LGHMF for 48 h (indicated as “48 h
LGHMF”). Moreover, we also intended to examine the recovery effects from LGHMF exposure; thus, RAW264.7 cells were
maintained under LGHMF for 48 h followed by culturing back
to normal environment for another 48 h (indicated as “48 h
LGHMF + 48 h Normal”). In case cells were treated with
RANKL to induce osteoclast differentiation, specific annotations such as “48 h LGHMF (RANKL)” and “48 h Normal
(RANKL)” were indicated.
D. In Vitro Osteoclastogenesis
RAW264.7 cells were prepared as osteoclast precursors. Cells
at the density of 3000/well were suspended in 96-stripwell
plates in the presence of RANKL (50 ng/mL). All cultures were
changed every 48 h with respective fresh media.
After being cultured for 96 h, cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and
washed three times with PBS. The fixed cells were stained for
TRAP using the Diagnostic Acid Phosphatase kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. TRAP+ cells were observed
under a microscope and counted as osteoclasts. Osteoclasts
with three or more nuclei were scored for statistical analyze.
Images were obtained using A-Plan 10 ×/0.25 PH1 and longdistance A-Plan 5 × PH0 objectives (Leica, Inc.) on a microscope (DM1L, Leica Microsystems GmbH, Germany) with a
Leica digital camera (DFC 420C). Images were acquired with
software (LAS v 4.0). Three independent experiments were conducted in triplicate.
E. Nitrite Assay for Estimation of NO Production
The accumulation of stable nitrite in culture supernatants
was detected using the assay as previously described [32].
RAW264.7 cells were plated in 96-well plates (3000/well), and
treated with various test reagents for different periods. Briefly,
100 μL supernatant was moved to an empty 96-well plate. Then,
100 μL of Griess reagent was added to each well and incubated
for 10 min at a room temperature. The absorption at 540 nm was
detected by SYNERGY-HT multiwell plate reader (Synergy HT,
BIO-TEK). A standard curve was decided by comparison with
sodium nitrite standards. Three independent experiments were
performed at least in duplicate.

F. Measurement of Cell Viability
Cell viability was assessed by quantitative colorimetric assay
with MTT as previously described [33]. Briefly, cells were cultured at a concentration of 5000/well in 96-stripwell plates and
treated with various test reagents for different periods. Then,
25-μL MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added to each well. After
incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the supernatant was replaced with
150-μL DMSO, and the absorbance (490 nm) was detected by a
plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Three independent
experiments were performed at least in duplicate.

G. Immunofluorescence Assay
Immunofluorescence analyses were performed as described
previously [34]. Cells cultured on the glass slides were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After three times of
rinses with TBS, cells were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100
for 5 min and followed by labeling with rhodamine-conjugated
phalloidin (1:100) in the dark for 1 h. After washing three
times, cells were treated with secondary antibodies (goat antimouse rhodamine–IgG, 1:100) or other fluorescence agents.
4 ,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1 μg/mL) was used to
counterstain nuclei. Cells were then washed three times with
TBS, enveloped by glycerol and assessed using a fluorescence
microscope (Nikon 80i, Japan). Experiments were repeated two
times. For each repeated experiment, all images were taken at
the same balance, gain, and brightness.
H. Real-Time PCR Analysis
This method has been previously described [35]. Total RNA
was prepared from RAW264.7 cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA
was transcribed from 1 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript
III RT-PCR system. The quantitative analyses of gene expression were performed using a Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR
detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). Real-time PCR
conditions are as follows: 94 °C for 30 sec, 95 °C for 5 sec,
60 °C for 30 sec, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. Data were
normalized to endogenous GAPDH levels using the comparative 2-Δ Δ CT method. Primer sequences are listed in Table I.
The gene expressions were examined in duplicate and repeated
for three times.
I. Bone Resorption Assay
Cells were cultured in Corning Osteo Assay Surface 96-well
plates. Media and treatment were changed every 48 h until the
end of a 6-d culture period. Wells were then removed by treating
with 10% sodium hypochlorite for 5 min, rinsed three times with
water and stained with the von Kossa method. After being incubated for 30 min in the dark, wells were rinsed twice with water
and incubated with 100 μL of 5% sodium carbonate for 10 min.
The unresorbed mineralized area turns black, whereas the resorbed surface are white. Pictures were captured using Olympus
CKX41 inverted microscope attached color camera and imaging software (MShot Image Analysis System 1.0). Digital images were analyzed using Image-Pro Plus software version 6.0

III. RESULTS
A. Effects of LGHMF on RAW264.7 Viability
Because LGHMF is a specific man-made environment, it is
necessary to evaluate the influence of such an extreme environment on cell viability. RAW264.7 cells were cultured under LGHMF exposure for 48 h, followed by incubating under LGHMF or normal condition for another 48 h. The MTT
cell viability assay showed that LGHMF (μg, 1 g and 2 g)
did not markedly affect the cell viability compared to controls [seeFig. 2(a) and (b)]. Moreover, in the presence of
RANKL (50 ng/mL), LGHMF showed no significant influence
on RAW264.7 cells [see Fig. 2(c)].
B. Effects of LGHMF on RAW264.7 NO Accumulation
In order to investigate the influences of LGHMF on NO concentration of RAW264.7 cells, NO production were detected
based on evaluating nitrite as a stable end product of NO by

Griess reagent. After 48 h of culturing in LGHMF, significant
reduction in NO production from 1 g group was observed as
compared with controls. Consequently, this alteration disappeared when cells were maintained in LGHMF for another 48 h.
Interestingly, the NO release of RAW264.7 cells was completely
inhibited when cells were cultured back to normal condition at
96 h, which can be completely reversed by RANKL treatment
[see Fig. 2(d)–(f)].
In the presence of RANKL (50 ng/mL), LGHMF exposure for
48 h has no obvious influence on NO production of RAW264.7
cells. However, a moderate increase in NO level of 1 g group
was observed as compared with control group [see Fig. 2(f)].

C. Effects of LGHMF on RANKL-Differentiating Osteoclast
Formation
The effect of LGHMF on osteoclast formation of RAW264.7
cells was examined was examined on RANKL-treated followed
by culturing back to normal environment for another 48 h [see
Fig. 1]. Osteoclast-like cells were characterized by analyzing
the formation of multinucleated cells. The formation of TRAPpositive cells in the μg and 1 g groups was significantly more
than that of the control group [see Fig. 3]. Moreover, cells of 2 g
group generated obviously less osteoclast than μg group.
D. LGHMF Affects Actin Arrangements of Osteoclasts
To examine the influence of LGHMF on osteoclast morphology, the alterations of F-actin arrangements were analyzed by using immunofluorescence staining with phalloidinrhodamine [see Fig. 4]. Osteoclasts under conditions of μg and
1 g exhibited broad or fine cytoplasmic process with peripheral

pseudopodial expansions compared to control and 2 g groups
(white arrows). Moreover, compared with the control group,
cells exposed to LGHMF were found to exhibit obvious aggregates of F-actin filaments around cell boundaries (green arrows). Under μg conditions, osteoclastic pedosome belts were
observed (blue arrows).

E. Effects of LGHMF on mRNA Expression
of Osteoclast-Related Genes in RANKL-Differentiating
RAW264.7 Cells
To investigate the influence of LGHMF on the expression of
osteoclast-related genes, qPCR analysis on total RNA of osteoclasts was carried out. In the presence of RANKL (50 ng/mL),
RAW264.7 cells were incubated under LGHMF for 48 h and,
subsequently, cultured back to normal condition for another
48 h.
First, we studied the mRNA expression changes of osteoclast
marker genes including RANK, TRAP, Cathepsin K, and MMP9. LGHMF exposure for 48 h had no obvious effect on RANK
mRNA expression as compared with controls; moreover, culturing in normal condition for another 48 h induced significant
higher expression in μg group [see Fig. 5(a)]. The mRNA expression of TRAP and Cathepsin K was completely suppressed
in RAW264.7 cells treated under LGHMF for 48 h, which were
reversed by culturing back to normal environment at 96 h [see
Fig. 5(b) and (c)]. Moreover, cells from μg group expressed
significantly higher Cathepsin K than that of control group. In
addition, cells treated with either 48 h of LGHMF exposure or,
subsequent, 48 h of normal environment expressed significantly
increased MMP-9 as compared with control and 2 g groups [see
Fig. 5(d)].

Subsequently, the expression of transcriptional factor genes
such as Runx2 and NFATc1 was also determined. In comparison with the control group, expression level of RunX2 in 1 g
group was obviously attenuated after 48 h of LGHMF exposure. However, this suppression was reversed by culturing back
to normal condition for another 48 h, accompanied with significantly decreased expression in μg group [see Fig. 5(e)]. Cells
from μg group expressed markedly higher NFATc1 as compared
with controls at either 48 or 96 h. In contrast, the expression of
NFATc1 in 1 g group was constantly inhibited [see Fig. 5(f)].
F. Effects of LGHMF on Osteoclast Resorption Ability
Finally, we evaluated the influence of LGHMF on osteoclast
bone resorption activity. Osteoclasts of μg group exerted higher
ability to degrade artificial bone matrix than that of control and
2 g groups. Moreover, cells from 1 g group exhibited significantly weaker capacity for bone resorption in comparison with
controls [see Fig. 6].

IV. DISCUSSION
To date, the diamagnetic levitation technique has received increased attention as a promising tool to produce various apparent gravity conditions, and is therefore widely applied in many
fields such as material research, chemistry, and biology. In the
present study, the effects of diamagnetic levitation on RANKLinduced osteoclast differentiation from RAW264.7 cells were
investigated for the first time. The novel and most significant
findings for this study are as follows: diamagnetic levitation
enhanced osteoclast differentiation, whereas magnetic field attenuated osteoclast resorption capacity. Moreover, LGHMF did
not have lethal effects on osteoclast precursors [see Table II].
It should be pointed out that because LGHMF is a compound combined environment, where HMFs coexist with apparent gravities constantly; thus, it is difficult to distinguish the
effects from HMF or simulated weightlessness absolutely. However, these effects could be investigated by designing and comparing different experiment groups [7]. As shown in Table II,
the effects of diamagnetic levitation, simulated weightlessness,
and magnetic field can be obtained by comparisons between μg
versus control group, μg versus 2 g group, and 1 g versus control
group, respectively.
A. Effects of LGHMF on RAW264.7 Cells
Because cell viability is the basis for cell-based investigation,
it is hence necessary to examine whether or not RAW264.7
cells can survive the extreme environment of LGHMF. MTT
cell viability results showed that the viability of RAW264.7
cells exposed to LGHMF did not decrease in comparison with
controls, indicating that LGHMF does not affect the viability of
osteoclast precursors [see Fig. 2(a)–(c)]. These observations are
consistent with our previous studies, which exhibit that LGHMF
does not have lethal effects on the viability of osteoblasts such
as MG-63 and MC3T3-E1 cells [21]. Hence, these findings hint
that LGHMF could be used as a suitable platform for biology
study at the cellular level.
B. Influences of Diamagnetic Levitation on Osteoclastogenesis
Due to infrequent accessibility of space flight, ground-based
apparatuses have become useful tools to simulate weightlessness conditions. In the current study, diamagnetic levitation
(indicated as μg), which has already been used to simulate
weightlessness [21], provides a useful tool for investigation of
osteoclast differentiation under conditions of modeled weightlessness. In our experimental system, diamagnetic levitation
provoked significantly increased osteoclast differentiation in
comparison with controls [see Table II]. Consistent with these
observations, osteoclast differentiation is significantly enhanced
under conditions of modeled microgravity [36], [37]. Moreover,
a recent report exhibits that aggressive osteoclast activity is
found in mice under microgravity environment, which provides
in vivo evidence for the augmented osteoclastogenesis under
conditions of weightlessness [38]. Together, these published
facts, with our findings, suggest that exposure to weightlessness
condition leads to enhanced osteoclast differentiation.

905

During the process of osteoclast differentiation, markedly alterations involving actin arrangements such as appearance of
actin cloud and pedosome belt that together identifies osteoclast lineage are previously described [44], [45]. In the current
study, diamagnetic levitation exposure for 48 h leads to significant changes in actin arrangements of osteoclast, such as active
cytoplasmic peripheral pseudopodial expansions, obvious formation of actin cloud, and pedosome belt in comparison with the
control group [see Fig. 4], which indicate enhanced osteoclast
formation.
In the bone resorption experiment (see Fig. 6), the stronger
signal of μg LGHMF suggests that diamagnetic levitation enhanced bone resorption capacity than the control. And the
weaker signal from 1 g group hints an inhibitory effect of magnetic field on osteoclast function. Also, signal from 2 g group
is significantly weaker than the μg group, which indicates that
simulated weightless may enhance the bone degrading ability
of osteoclast. In addition, 2g group showed weaker signal than
1g group.
Notably, 1 g group produced more TRAP-positive multinucleated cells than control, which indicates that magnetic field
enhanced the formation of osteoclast. In contrast, we noticed
that 1 g gave weaker signal in the bone resorption test (see
Fig. 6), which looks not consistent with the augmented modulation of magnetic field in the osteoclast formation experiment.
About this discrepancy, we may not find adequate explanations
for this phenomenon yet, which in our speculation may be a new
property of magnetic field at this intensity.
C. Involvement of NO in LGHMF-Caused
Osteoclastogenesis Changes
Currently, NO is reported to modulate the osteoclastogenesis by dose-dependent and biphasic manners, as NO enhances
osteoblast-induced bone formation and osteoclast-induced bone
remodeling at low concentration [39], [40], but attenuates osteoclastogenesis during inflammation or in estrogen-deficient animals at high level [41], [42]. Recently, NO is reported to enhance
the osteoclastogenesis via mediating cell fusion of RAW264.7
cells [25]. In our present study, the addition of RANKL reversed
the inhibitory effect of LGHMF on cell NO release [see Fig. 2(c)
and (f)]. These findings hint that RANKL may activate the NO
release of RAW264.7 cells, which has also been described by
previous report [43]. Moreover, this phenomenon, where inducers of osteoclast differentiation stimulate the NO release of
osteoclast precursors, was also reported by our previous study
[19], further hinting that exposure of LGHMF leads to activation
of NO signaling pathway.
Our previous report has described that, during osteoclastlike cell differentiation of FLG29.1 cells, modeled microgravity
produced by LGHMF significantly inhibits NO release at 72 h,
while apparent gravity alteration shows no effect on NO production [19]. However, in the current study, when RANKL-treated
RAW264.7 cells were cultured in LGHMF for 48 h and, subsequently, cultured back to normal condition for another 48 h,
no obvious attenuation of NO levels was observed. On the contrary, the NO release of cells from 1 g group was significantly

increased compared to the control group [see Fig. 3(f)]. Possibly, these discrepancies may reflect the differences in cell lines,
experiment system, or other variables.
D. Effects of LGHMF on Osteoclast Genes
Moreover, we also assessed the effects of LGHMF on osteoclast marker gene expression. It has been previously observed
that microgravity exposure leads to enhanced mRNA expression of osteoclast marker genes in osteoclast including RANK,
Cathepsin K, and MMP-9 [27], [29], [36], [46], [47]. Consistent
with these facts, our results demonstrate that both diamagnetic
levitation and modeled weightlessness enhanced expression of
RANK, Cathepsin K, and MMP-9 in comparison with controls,
which could not be reversed by recovery treatment for 48 h [see
Fig. 5(a), (c), and (d)]. Moreover, the gene expression of RANK
in 1 g LGHMF was significantly repressed compared with the
control [see Fig. 5(a)]. This result indicates that magnetic field
inhibits osteoclastogenesis, which is consistent with the data
from the bone degrading experiment [see Fig. 6], as magnetic
field markedly inhibited bone resorption ability in comparison
with the control group.
Also, the expression of transcriptional modulator genes such
as NFATc1 and RunX2 was evaluated. Diamagnetic levitation
significantly up-regulated NFATc1 expression in an irreversible
manner [see Fig. 5(f)], hinting a positive role may be involved. In
contrast, both diamagnetic levitation and modeled weightlessness exerted no influences on RunX2 mRNA expression, which
was turned into inhibitory effects during the recovery process
[see Fig. 5(e)]. These findings suggest that RunX2 is sensitive
to the recovery response from diamagnetic levitation and modeled weightlessness. Interestingly, almost all osteoclast-related
genes tested were repressed by magnetic field, which hinting a

negative role magnetic field for osteoclast genes [see Table III].
Moreover, these data, together with the inhibitory effects of
magnetic field for osteoclast resorption [see Fig. 6], suggest
that magnetic field may have inhibitory effects on osteoclast
differentiation.
During the recovery process, osteoclast genes exhibited different sensitivities to the magnetic field. On the one hand, magnetic field repressed some osteoclast genes in an irreversible
way. As illustrated [see Fig. 5(c) and (f)], 48 h of normal culture failed to recover the magnetic field-induced gene inhibition
(Cathepsin K and NFATc1), hinting an irreversible regulation of
magnetic field. On the other hand, some osteoclast genes were
suppressed by magnetic field in a reversible manner. For example, the inhibition of gene expression (TRAP and RunX2) was
recovered in 48-h culture of normal environment [see Fig 5(b)
and (e)], indicating that these genes are sensitive to the recovery
process of magnetic field.

V. CONCLUSION
In summary, we have shown here for the first time that diamagnetic levitation promotes osteoclastogenesis including enhances both the formation and resorption capacity of osteoclast.
Whereas magnetic field produced by LGHMF represses a osteoclast resorption function. Moreover, osteoclast marker genes
are sensitive to not only treatments of diamagnetic levitation
magnetic field, but also to the recovery process of normal environment. LGHMF does not have acute lethal effects on osteoclast precursors, which offers new opportunities for osteoclast
study, perhaps even more biomedical fields. LGHMF, especially
diamagnetic levitation as fascinating physiological environment
with unique properties, is worthy for further study [20], [21].
