Abstract—Freezing of gait (FOG), an episodic gait disturbance
characterized by the inability to generate effective stepping, occurs
in more than half of Parkinson’s disease patients. It is associated
with both executive dysfunction and attention and becomes most
evident during dual tasking (performing two tasks simultaneously).
This study examined the effect of dual motor-cognitive virtual reality training on dual-task performance in FOG. Twenty community dwelling participants with Parkinson’s disease (13 with FOG,
7 without FOG) participated in a pre-assessment, eight 20-minute
intervention sessions, and a post-assessment. The intervention consisted of a virtual reality maze (DFKI, Germany) through which
participants navigated by stepping-in-place on a balance board
(Nintendo, Japan) under time pressure. This was combined with
a cognitive task (Stroop test), which repeatedly divided participants’ attention. The primary outcome measures were pre- and
post-intervention differences in motor (stepping time, symmetry,
rhythmicity) and cognitive (accuracy, reaction time) performance
during single- and dual-tasks. Both assessments consisted of 1) a
single cognitive task 2) a single motor task, and 3) a dual motorcognitive task. Following the intervention, there was significant improvement in dual-task cognitive and motor parameters (stepping
time and rhythmicity), dual-task effect for those with FOG and a
noteworthy improvement in FOG episodes. These improvements
were less significant for those without FOG. This is the first study
to show benefit of a dual motor-cognitive approach on dual-task
performance in FOG. Advances in such virtual reality interventions for home use could substantially improve the quality of life
for patients who experience FOG.

I. INTRODUCTION
REEZING of gait (FOG) is a brief episodic phenomenon
characterized by the “absence or marked reduction in forward progression of the feet despite the intention to walk” [1].
This paroxysmal symptom affects up to 60% of patients with
advanced Parkinson’s disease. FOG occurs most commonly at
gait initiation, during turning, in narrow spaces, under stressful/emotional circumstances, and, particularly, when patients
are asked to perform a second task while walking (dual-tasking)
[2]. These effects are accentuated under time pressure.
Despite advances in pharmacological therapy for Parkinson’s
disease, FOG remains a significant problem for those affected
and is associated with falls and admission to nursing homes [3].
Recently, there has been increased awareness of FOG; however,
the underlying mechanisms still remain poorly understood. A
number of proposed pathophysiological mechanisms have been
reviewed extensively elsewhere [1], [4]. Associations between
the pathophysiology of FOG and executive dysfunction, specifically divided attention [5], verbal fluency [6], and set shifting [7]
has gained interest. Examining these relationships may enhance
our understanding of FOG.
Dual-task paradigms are a powerful way to evaluate the effect of divided attention on individual tasks (e.g., gait, cognitive
tasks). By comparing the performance of a dual task (e.g., combined motor and cognitive tasks) with the individual component
tasks, one can estimate the individuals capacity to divide attention between these tasks. Dual-task performance can be assessed
quantitatively as a percentage change in performance between a
single-task and dual-task condition (the dual-task effect). Dualtask paradigms place a cognitive load on the participant while
walking by increasing the attention demand required to perform
a task and have been shown to impact FOG [5], [8]. Difficulty
with dual tasking is also associated with gait impairments in the
general Parkinson’s disease population [9].
Gait impairments in Parkinson’s disease manifest during both
single- and dual-task conditions. During single-gait tasks those
with Parkinson’s disease have greater deficits in gait speed,
stride length, double support time and stride time variability
compared to healthy controls [10]. The additional stress exerted
during dual-tasks manifests in further reductions in gait speed,
stride length, symmetry and stride time variability. In addition,
these dual-task gait impairments (as well as single-task gait impairments) do not improve with dopamine replacement therapy.
Greater deficits in stride length [11], stride time, gait asymmetry
[12], rhythmicity [13] and dual-tasking also exist in those with
FOG.

Interventions to alleviate gait impairments in Parkinson’s
disease have employed both single- and dual-task walking conditions. Those incorporating single walking tasks report improvements; however, dual tasks (cueing, cognitive strategies,
dual-task training) have shown differing results.
Interventions utilizing cueing strategies found improvements
in both single- and dual-task walking with one study finding
improvements maintained six weeks after intervention [14].
Those employing cognitive strategies found improvements in
single- but not dual-task walking abilities. Interventions focused
on dual-task training report improvements in step length when
dual-tasking, even when limited to a single 20-min session [15].
The positive effects of dual-task training on gait parameters in
Parkinson’s disease suggest this training enhances divided attention abilities during locomotion [16], [17]. Additionally, in older
adults, interventions which include executive function strategies
and dual-task training (balance and cognition) improve postural
control, dual-tasking ability [18], and falls risk [19]. In Parkinson’s disease, motor training improves postural control [20].
However, less is known about the benefit of interventions in
FOG.
In this study, the intervention incorporated motor and cognitive training. People with Parkinson’s disease require greater
cognitive control during gait tasks due to the loss of habitual
motor control. There is a close association between cognitive
deficits (in particular, executive function deficits) and FOG [21]–
[23]. However, there are limited available cognitive therapies for
cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease [24]. Early cognitive interventions prevent cognitive decline in other cohorts
(healthy older adults) [19]. The potential for cognitive-based
therapeutic approaches for treating FOG has recently been suggested [25]. Cognitive interventions improve cognition in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (specifically global cognition,
memory, executive function, processing speed, and visuospatialconstructive abilities [25]) with some studies also finding motor
improvements [26]. Motor interventions improve mobility as
well as cognition which in turn may further improve mobility.
We hypothesized that a dual motor-cognitive intervention could
be particularly beneficial in both cognitive and motor domains.
Virtual Reality (VR) has been employed to examine FOG
in Parkinson’s disease [27]; however, VR environments have
not been considered to date as a specific therapeutic strategy for
FOG. Interventions incorporating VR for those with Parkinson’s
disease have been shown to improve obstacle crossing performance and dynamic balance [28]. Furthermore, interventions
incorporating VR motor training on a treadmill have shown improvements in gait variability and gait speed during dual tasking
[29].
The experimental setup of interventions is typically immobile and expensive. A recent review by Hindle et al. found little
evidence existing on the use of balance boards, an inexpensive
mobile solution, for cognitive training in Parkinson’s disease
[24]. These technologies, which allow stepping-in-place on a
balance board, have been utilized previously in the literature
to mimic gait [30]. Interventions incorporating balance boards
have also shown benefits in function and cognition when compared with balance exercises alone [24]. No study to date has

reported the effects of a combined cognitive and physical training for FOG although a published protocol for an ongoing trial
does exist [31]. Given the close link between gait and cognition as well as the impairments in dual tasking in patients with
FOG, one might expect that training specifically targeted at
dual-tasking, while stepping-in-place could improve FOG and
gait in Parkinson’s disease. This study presents results on a VR
dual-task intervention, in a cohort of participants with and without FOG, which combines motor and cognitive tasks in an effort
to improve dual-task ability.
A. Aim and Hypothesis
First, we hypothesized that eight sessions of a combined
motor-cognitive VR-based intervention would improve dualtasking ability in patients with and without FOG. Second, we
hypothesized that this increased dual-task capacity would result in improvements in temporal gait parameters in Parkinson’s
disease.
II. METHODS
A. Participants
Twenty community dwelling participants with Parkinson’s
disease: 13 with FOG (FOG), 7 without FOG (non-FOG) were
recruited from the Movement Disorder Clinic in the Dublin
Neurological Institute at the Mater Misericordiae University
Hospital to participate in the intervention. Ethical approval was
granted from the Ethics Committee at the Hospital and informed
consent was obtained from all patients. All patients underwent
a clinical assessment by a movement disorder specialist, a preintervention assessment, an intervention, and a post-intervention
assessment, as described in detail below. The two groups were
age and disease stage matched. Table I details the personal
characteristics of each group.
B. Intervention Procedure
The intervention was conducted in a hospital environment but
was designed to be as mobile as possible to allow future translation to a home-based intervention given the reduced mobility
of this patient group.
Participants were invited to attend the hospital for 20-minute
intervention sessions on eight occasions over a two-week period. Two participants attended simultaneously for each session
and performed the intervention at either end of the same room.

of maze (image on main screen).

Participants were on their regular medication for all sessions
and no adjustments to medication regimens took place during
the intervention. The intervention combined cognitive and motor training. The task was displayed on a 55-in screen placed at
a height of 2 m, 1 metre in front of the participant. The design
consisted of a VR maze game (DFKI, Germany) through which
the participant navigated with the assistance of a map legend
(screen: top left) (see Fig. 1).
The maze incorporated turns, narrow corridors and doorways,
factors which frequently trigger FOG. The VR environment ran
at a constant velocity of 1 m/s and included objects on the
wall (framed paintings, radiators) to create a valid ecological
environment. Navigation was achieved by stepping-in-place on
a balance board and pressing remote buttons (both Nintendo
Wii, Japan) to turn left and right, adding a further cognitive
task. To recreate a situation in which a FOG episode might
occur participants had to find their way out of the maze within
a time limit indicated by a countdown timer (screen: top right).
The intervention also included a simultaneous cognitive task,
Stroop test, which exerted an additional cognitive load (by dividing attention) while stepping-in-place [32]. The Stroop test
has been previously employed in dual-task studies in Parkinson’s disease [33] and requires participants to match word-color
pairs, probing executive control, and selective attention. During navigation through the maze, participants were repeatedly
presented with word-color pairs at the bottom of the screen. If
the word and color matched or mismatched, participants were
asked to press the remote left button or right button, respectively.
On-screen feedback of Stroop test performance was presented

to the participants on completion of each maze to encourage
equal priority be given to navigating through the maze and performing the cognitive task. The intervention was designed to be
more cognitively challenging than the assessments as the maze
increased in complexity (e.g., increased number of turns, shorter
time to complete maze, more route options, and dead ends). To
ensure safety, a walking frame and a nonslip mat were modified to incorporate the balance board and remotes. However,
participants’ movements were not restricted.
C. Pre- and Post-Intervention Assessment
1) Clinical Assessment: The testing protocol included an assessment before (pre-assessment) and after (post-assessment)
the intervention and has been previously described [34]. All assessments took place on regular medications but there were no
differences in medication doses or timings between the assessments. All participants underwent clinical and neuropsychological testing including montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA),
frontal assessment battery (FAB), and Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III), as well as the new FOG
questionnaire [35].
2) VR Assessment: Different cognitive tasks and virtual environments were employed in the intervention and the assessments
to reduce learning effects. The VR environment consisted of a
single long corridor with doorways and narrowings (see Fig. 2).
The cognitive task involved a two-stimulus visual oddball task
which has been previously utilized to investigate cognitive function during locomotion [36]. The visual stimulus consisted of
either vertical (standard) or 45° rotated (target) green crosses
displayed randomly (interstimulus interval: 250–750 ms, target
stimuli probability 0.2). Participants were asked to press a button every time the target stimulus was presented but to ignore
the standard stimulus.
Participants were asked to perform three different tasks as
follows:
1. A single motor task: Stepping-in-place on the balance
board through the VR corridor.
2. A single cognitive task: Performance of the two-stimulus
visual oddball task, while seated with automatic visual
flow through the corridor to ensure a minimal change of
visual input between tasks.

1858

3. A dual motor-cognitive task: Performance of the twostimulus visual oddball task, while stepping-in-place on
the balance board through the VR corridor.
Instructions were given to perform the tasks as quickly as possible and to perform all tasks with equal priority. Participants
undertook three 100-s trials of each task. Tasks were counterbalanced to remove practice effect.
D) Assessment Measures: Motor and cognitive measures
were acquired during both pre- and post-assessment. Standard
clinical measures of motor and cognitive function were also acquired. The cognitive measures employed were mean reaction
time (RT) and accuracy acquired during both the single cognitive
task and the dual motor-cognitive task. Only correct responses
were included in analysis. The motor measures employed: stepping time (average peak-to-peak interval per stepping cycle),
rhythmicity (stepping time variability), and symmetry, were acquired from vertical ground reaction force data from a balance
board during both the single motor task and the dual motorcognitive task. Symmetry is commonly calculated as a ratio of
shorter to longer mean swing time (time during which one foot
is off the ground) but this was difficult to determine due to participants not fully lifting feet from the balance board. Instead the
loading and unloading times of both feet was used to assess symmetry. Loading and unloading occurs during the double stance
phase when the majority of weight shifts from one foot to the
other and corresponds to the crossover points of the force signals
for each foot on a synchronized plot of the data. The loading
time of one foot corresponds to the unloading time of the other
foot, and is 50% of a full gait cycle for a symmetrical gait [37].
Coefficient of variation (CV) (ratio of standard deviation to the
mean) was used to evaluate rhythmicity and symmetry. Analysis included all gait data for each trial, incorporating all FOG
episodes. Thus, any improvement or worsening in gait parameter results also incorporates increases and decreases in FOG.
For stepping time and rhythmicity, left and right leg values were
pooled together.
All measures were calculated in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Dual-task effect was calculated as follows for
the above cognitive and motor measures:
Dual-Task Eﬀect, DTE =
(Single-Task Performance − Dual-Task Performance)
.
Dual-Task Performance

All trials were video recorded and analyzed offline by a movement disorder specialist. Number and duration of FOG episodes
as well as total time spent frozen were recorded for each trial.
A freezing episode was defined as foot rise failure from the balance board for two consecutive stepping cycles, ending when
one full stepping cycle was complete. Cognitive measures were
calculated during the intervention to assess performance: time to
complete maze, RT, and accuracy (correct answers) (see Fig. 3).
E) Statistical Analyses: Both within-participant (pre-to-post
intervention) and between-participant (FOG, non-FOG) variances were investigated for those with FOG and for those without FOG using conservative F tests (Huynh-Feldt, GreenhouseGeisser, and Box’s) included in a repeated measure ANOVA at
significance p < 0.05. Gait measures for the single motor task

and the dual motor-cognitive tasks, in addition to RT for the single cognitive task, and the dual motor-cognitive task were investigated. All ANOVA assumptions were met. Paired t-tests were
employed to examine differences in FOG episodes (p < 0.05).
Two participants from the FOG group were excluded from the
gait analyses, one due to running in place instead of steppingin-place (no double-support stage for comparison) and one due
to incomplete gait data.
III. RESULTS
A. Cognitive and Motor Assessment Measures
Differences between groups during the intervention (see
Fig. 3) show improvements in all measures. Pre- and postintervention results and differences between groups are shown
in Table II. Comparing those with and without FOG at baseline, significant differences between groups were found for all
three gait parameters for both single and dual tasks. Dual-task
RT and RT dual-task effect were also significantly different between groups pre-intervention. Post-intervention gait parameter
differences persisted between groups but were less significant.
Furthermore, the dual-task RT and RT dual-task effect differences demonstrated between groups prior to the intervention
were no longer significant. Within group intervention differences are shown in Table II. For the FOG group, there was a
significant post-intervention improvement (p < 0.05) in singletask stepping time and in dual-task stepping time, rhythmicity,
and RT, as well as dual-task effects for RT and accuracy. Singletask RT also improved but not significantly (p = 0.052). For
the non-FOG group, there was a significant post-intervention
improvement in single-task stepping time and RT and dual-task
stepping time. There were noteworthy improvements in rhythmicity dual-task effect, p = 0.06 (−15.1 ± 46.0%) and RT
during the dual task.
Post-intervention, the number of FOG episodes per trial decreased for the dual task and remained the same for the single
task. This was not found to be statistically significant (FOG
episodes per trial (mean ± sd): Single: 2 ± 2.7 (pre), 2 ± 2.9
(post): p = 0.57, dual: 3 ± 3.9 (pre), 1 ± 2.0 (post), p = 0.10,
FOG duration[s] per trial: Single: 13 ± 21.3 (pre), 14 ± 26.6
(post): p = 0.9, dual: 20 ± 29.1 (pre), 18 ± 37.3 (post), p = 0.9).
IV. DISCUSSION
The main objective of this study was to investigate
whether combined motor-cognitive virtual training improves

dual-tasking ability in patients with and without FOG. Few studies exist to date specifically targeting cognitive or combined
motor-cognitive training in FOG or Parkinson’s disease. This
study found a significant improvement in dual-task performance
for those with FOG following this intervention as measured by
improvements in dual-task stepping time, rhythmicity and RT. A
noteworthy decrease in number of FOG episodes during the dual
task was also found. Outcome measures were acquired during
different experimental paradigms than those in the intervention.
These results are novel due to the assessment measures employed (dual-task cognitive and gait parameters while stepping)
as well as the modality of the intervention (dual motor-cognitive
incorporating VR) in this population (FOG). These results are
encouraging. Further studies with a larger sample size may find
motor-cognitive dual tasking to have the potential to alleviate
FOG, improved quality of life and reducing falls risk.
At baseline, there were significant differences between groups
in balance board gait parameters; those with FOG having significantly longer stepping time and greater rhythmicity and symmetry than those without FOG. These findings are consistent
with previously described gait disturbances in FOG. Moreover,
there was a significantly poorer performance in dual-task RT
and RT dual-task effect pre-intervention in the FOG group.
Post-intervention, this study found an improvement in both
cognitive and motor performance during a dual task, (especially
in those with FOG) as assessed by stepping time and rhythmicity
(motor), RT and RT dual-task effect (cognitive). There were also
tendencies to improve in the non-FOG group with stepping time
significantly different post-intervention. Mean RT, accuracy and
time to complete the maze also improved during the intervention, in keeping with the post-intervention results (see Fig. 3).
In addition, at pre-assessment, the mean gait parameters for
those with FOG were significantly different compared to those
without FOG; at post-assessment, the differences between these
values had notably reduced. Furthermore, the improvement

in dual-task RT and in RT dual-task effect seen in those with
FOG was not seen in the non-FOG cohort such that the difference seen at pre-assessment was not evident post-intervention.
This implies that the improvements gained during the intervention were more marked for the group with FOG, bringing the
performance of the FOG group closer to that of the non-FOG
group. This differential effect may be explained by a greater
room for improvement in the FOG group (given the worse baseline parameters) or a specific effect of this intervention on those
with FOG.
There was little improvement in DTE measures. This may
indicate that the motor improvement seen in the single task
was retained in the more complex dual-task paradigm. This,
in conjunction with cognitive improvement post-intervention,
highlights the benefit of employing a dual-task paradigm. This
may suggest such combined motor-cognitive training has an effect on both cognitive dual-task performance during locomotion
and on gait parameters. This is not surprising given the welldescribed association between dual-task performance and gait
in Parkinson’s disease [21]. Previous studies in healthy older
populations have also shown an improvement in balance and
gait with dual-task training [19].
Caution should always be used in interpreting gait parameters measured from a stepping-in-place task as this may involve
different neural and cognitive processes than required for normal locomotion in real environments. Although balance and
posture are closely associated with FOG, FOG is inherently
a problem with step initiation. This study focused our analysis on stepping-in-place which has been validated previously
in an FOG cohort [37] rather than balance measures [16], [38]
as examined in other studies. Motor arrests during lower limb
motor tasks (stepping-in-place or alternate stepping on pedals
while seated) have been correlated with FOG questionnaires and
clinically observed FOG episodes [37], [39]. Given the close association between the breakdown of these motor performance

parameters in real environments and the development of FOG,
one might expect that improvements in these parameters, even
in a VR setting, may have a subsequent effect on gait and FOG in
real environments. The noteworthy improvement in number of
freezing episodes post-intervention supports this, and we postulate that a larger sample size may show a statistically significant
improvement.
This study has limitations as it is a pilot study with a small
sample size. Differences between groups in disease severity
(UPDRS) and cognitive function (MOCA, FAB) may also have
greatly affected results and created a possible ceiling effect in
the non-FOG group also. Improvements for the FOG group may
be attributed to greater disease severity and poorer cognitive
function, instead of specificity to FOG. Nevertheless, patients
with severe disease, cognitive impairment and FOG are a group
who represent a significant therapeutic challenge. These results
suggest that this group may derive the greatest benefit from
such training. Further work is required to extract the factors
which lead to this benefit. Another limitation of this study is
that although different experimental paradigms were used in
the assessment and intervention, a learning effect of steppingin-place cannot be excluded. These factors limit this study’s
clinical meaning. However, this study does show the potential
efficacy of recent technological advances (assessment of motorcognitive function employing VR and portable balance board)
for clinical application.
The specific improvement during dual tasking in cognitive
and motor function and number of FOG episodes (noteworthy)
for those with FOG is of particular interest. It shows that the
participants were able to be trained in a dual task improving
their performance. This suggests that dual-task capacity can
be increased. The central role that dual-tasking plays in FOG
has been shown in clinical and imaging studies [40]. Probing
dual-task paradigms further may show their efficacy in targeting
attentional capacity in this population. This may also have implications for reducing frequency and severity of FOG, thereby
reducing falls, as well as improving overall gait in Parkinson’s
disease.
The experimental setup of interventions is typically immobile and expensive. The results of this study support the use of
a relatively inexpensive, mobile balance board, and a VR environment for use in a hospital setting for a community dwelling
population. It also suggests that the intervention may be easily
translated to a home-based or community-center-based setting
for use by this population. This would be particularly beneficial given the reduced mobility of this population. There is a
little evidence for the use of balance boards [24] for acquisition of temporal gait parameters and few studies have employed
the Wii balance board [16], [38], [41] to improve balance and
postural stability in Parkinson’s disease. However, these studies did not evaluate stepping-in-place and no study to date has
focused on FOG. This study examines stepping-in-place on a
balance board to assess gait, as previously examined by Nantel
et al. (2012). This increases the experimental novelty of this
intervention design, both as intervention and assessment.
Results from this pilot study suggest that VR environments
may be useful in the clinical setting, both as a means of assessing

gait in Parkinson’s disease but also as a potential therapeutic
intervention. Future studies should confirm these findings in
a larger cohort. The role of dual-task training in Parkinson’s
disease, and, in particular, in FOG has implications, not only
in alleviating this disabling symptom, but also in furthering our
understanding of this phenomenon.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This is the first pilot study to show the effect of combined
motor-cognitive dual-task training on gait and dual-task performance in Parkinson’s disease patients with and without FOG.
Measures of dual tasking were found to significantly improve
post-intervention in patients with FOG, as well as a noteworthy
decrease in number of FOG episodes.
Further research is required on a larger cohort to extract the
exact mechanisms of improvement. The VR platform can be
customized, providing a system for answering specific research
questions in these patients, as well as customizing interventions
to target specific triggers of FOG, which often vary between
patients. Advances in such VR interventions employed in the
home could substantially improve the quality of life for those
who experience FOG.
