Acoustic Features for the Identification
of Coronary Artery Disease
Samuel E. Schmidt∗ , Claus Holst-Hansen, John Hansen, Egon Toft, and Johannes J. Struijk

Abstract—Goal: Earlier studies have documented that coronary
artery disease (CAD) produces weak murmurs, which might be
detected through analysis of heart sounds. An electronic stethoscope with a digital signal processing unit could be a low cost and
easily applied method for diagnosis of CAD. The current study
is a search for heart sound features which might identify CAD.
Methods: Nine different types of features from five overlapping
frequency bands were obtained and analyzed using 435 recordings
from 133 subjects. Results: New features describing an increase in
low-frequency power in CAD patients were identified. The features
of the different types were relatively strongly correlated. Using a
quadratic discriminant function, multiple features were combined
into a CAD-score. The area under the receiving operating characteristic for the CAD score was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.69–0.78). Conclusion: The result confirms that there is a potential in heart sounds for
the diagnosis of CAD, but that further improvements are necessary
to gain clinical relevance.

I. INTRODUCTION
ORONARY artery disease (CAD) is the most common
cause of death in the western world. Myocardial infarction
or acute heart failure may be the first symptoms, the seriousness
of which underlines the urgency of an early diagnosis of the disease. Current diagnostic methods include coronary angiography,
CT, and physiological stress tests. Common for these methods
is that they are comprehensive and expensive and thereby suited
for specialized clinical departments only. An inexpensive and
easy to use diagnostic modality would add greatly to the capabilities of smaller medical centers and the general practitioners to
detect CAD. Moreover, a precise assessment in the early phase
may also allow for an efficient referral and thereby reduce the
number of demanding examinations.
Previous studies have shown that heart sounds contain weak
murmurs caused by turbulent flow in the coronary arteries, and
that those murmurs are indicators of CAD [1]–[4]. The murmurs
are rarely audible, but algorithms to automatically detect them
through signal analysis have been proposed [5].

Cardiovascular murmurs are characterized by nonstationary
wide band noise, arising from the turbulent blood colliding with
the arterial wall [6], which is in agreement with the findings that
show that CAD is associated with increased diastolic energy
above 200–300 Hz [7]–[9]. In addition, cardiovascular murmur
may contain narrow band signal components, which is thought
to originate from the resonance frequency of the arterial wall.
Jin-Zhao et al. modeled the resonance frequency of coronary
arteries and found two resonance frequency peaks, around 50–
100 Hz and around 150–200 Hz [10]. In comparison with normal
arteries, in stenosed arteries the low frequency peak moved
to lower frequencies and the high frequency peak moved to
higher frequencies. In addition, the power of the low frequency
peak was decreased and the power of the high frequency peak
was increased in the presence of a stenosis. Empirical studies
confirmed the increased frequency and amplitude of the bandlimited high frequency component [4], [11]. Multiple methods
have been applied for identification of the broadband component
and of the resonance related components. This includes spectral
estimation methods such as fast Fourier transform [1], wavelet
analysis [12], fast tracking filters [13], and parametric models
[14].
Early methods for the acoustic detection of CAD used custom
made sensitive and fragile recording equipment, which is not
compatible with a clinical environment. The goal of the current
study is to develop a method for noninvasive detection of CAD
with a commercially available electronic stethoscope. Since the
current literature is inconsistent in regards to frequency bands
and features to analyze, the focus of the current study is to
analyze and compare a wide range of features extracted from
several frequency bands of heart sound recordings.
II. METHOD
A. Data Collection
Bedside recordings were made from the fourth intercostal
space at the left sternal border on the chest of patients using
an electronic stethoscope (3M Littmann E4000). This stethoscope has a flat frequency response from 20–1000 Hz and a
spectrum analysis shows that the noise floor is at least 15–20 dB
lower than the power of the diastole sound up to 1000 Hz.
Each recording was 8 s long corresponding to the capacity of
the stethoscope. Patients were asked to breathe normally during
the heart sound acquisition and between one and six recordings
were collected from each subject. To avoid overrepresentation of
some subjects, a maximum of four recordings were selected per
individual. The sample rate was 4000 samples per second. The
recordings were subsequently transferred to a portable PC. The

patients were referred for coronary angiography at the Cardiology Department at Aalborg Hospital, Denmark. The study was
approved by the local ethical committee (Den Videnskabs etiske
Komité for Viborg og Nordjyllands Amter, project number: VN
2005/58) and all patients gave their informed written and oral
consent to the study. The coronary angiography images from the
patients were analyzed with quantitative coronary angiography,
giving the diameters of the stenosis. CAD subjects were defined
as subjects with at least one stenosis with a diameter reduction
of at least 50%. Inclusion criteria were normal heart rhythm, no
heart valve disease which generates diastolic murmurs, and a
recording quality that allowed visual recognition of the first and
second heart sounds. Recordings with dominating noise were
excluded using the more tolerant set of criteria defined by the
authors in an earlier study [15]. In total, seven subjects were
excluded due to noise leaving 133 subjects with 435 recordings
in the study (see Table I).
B. Preprocessing
Previous studies typically applied high-pass filters with cut
off frequencies at approximately 180 to 300 Hz. To allow for
lower frequencies and to distinguish differences in features with
narrow band or wide band characteristics, we defined features
in the following frequency bands: 25–250 Hz (low frequency
resonance), 25–1000 Hz (wide band), 50–500 Hz (used by Akay
et al. [2], [16]), 125–750 Hz, and 250–1000 Hz (high frequency
resonance, also used in earlier studies. [3], [4], [17]–[21]).
The diastolic periods were identified automatically using the
duration dependent hidden Markov model described in [22] and
[23]. To keep the focus on the performance of the features, the
segmentation results were validated by manual screening and
erroneous segmentations were corrected.
Friction spikes, caused by the friction between the stethoscope and the skin are a well-known disadvantage of the handheld electronic stethoscope [24]. In the current study, we used
the method of dividing diastole periods into 50% overlapping
subsegments of short duration (100 ms) and discarding subsegments with high variance [24] to reduce the influence of friction
spikes and other types of noise such as respiration noise. Each
feature is then calculated as the median of the values in the
remaining subsegments from all heart beats. Due to the short
subsegment duration, the CAD murmur can be assumed to be
stationary in each subsegment. The threshold of acceptable variance was set as α times the median of the variance in the subsegments. Since the optimal variance threshold is likely to vary
among the spectral bands, α was determined for each band.

Since the coronary blood flow is highest in diastole and peaks
in the early diastole, the features were extracted from subsegments within analysis windows during diastole.
To avoid overfitting the settings for feature estimation, the
noise threshold α and the timing of the beginning and duration
of the analysis window were adjusted in each cross validation
set (see below). The settings were adjusted to maximize the
sum of the three best performing AR-features in the training
sets. The noise threshold values α were thus chosen as either
1, 2, 4, 10 or infinity. The start of the analysis window was
selected as either 0, 50, 100, or 150 ms after the endpoint of the
S2 sound defined by the segmentation method. The maximum
duration of the analysis window was chosen as 150, 300, 400 ms,
or as the entire diastolic duration. In any case, the duration
of the analysis window could not exceed the duration of the
diastole.
C. Features
1) Spectral Features: Three different approaches were used
for analyses of the frequency distribution of the diastole periods:
parametric spectral modeling, instantaneous frequency, and the
power in third octave frequency bands.
a) Parametric Models (AR and Music): The essence in
parametric spectral estimation is that a model of the signal, based
on few parameters can be estimated efficiently from relatively
little data after which the model’s spectrum can be calculated.
The advantages are a better resolution, noise robustness and
that few model parameters quantify the dominating frequency
characteristics. Akay et al. compared an autoregressive (AR)
model, an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, and
an eigenvector based model for acoustic detection for of CAD
[4]. The eigenvector method was the most effective one, classifying 83.75% of the 80 cases correctly. Since the AR model and
the ARMA model demonstrated about the same performance,
78.75% and 77.50%, only the AR model was used in addition
to the eigenvector method in the current study.
The poles of AR models with model orders 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and
12 were estimated in each frequency band. The model parameters were estimated using the Modified Covariance AR estimator. From each model, the pole magnitudes and angles from all
poles were extracted as features. In total, 42 AR features were
estimated from each frequency band.
The eigenvector-based model assumes that the signal is composed of a limited number of sine functions together with white
noise, which may be a good model for (arterial) resonance phenomena. The MUSIC method was used for estimation of the
frequency and amplitude of the sinusoids after decomposition.
For each sinusoid component, both the amplitude and the frequency were used as features. These features were extracted using 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 sinusoids (Signal subspace dimension),
thereby the complexity of the eigenvector models corresponds to
the complexity of the AR-models. In total, 42 MUSIC features
were estimated from each frequency band.
b) Instantaneous Frequency and Amplitude (IFA): Instantaneous frequency describes the frequency at a particular time
and is well suited for nonstationary signals [25]. Instantaneous

frequency can be estimated from the analytic signal
z (t) = x (t) + jv(t)

(1)

where x(t) is the signal and v(t) is the Hilbert transformed signal. From the analytic signal the phase, θ(t), and the amplitude
are calculated. The Instantaneous frequency is the derivative of
the phase:
ω(t) =

dθ(t)
.
dt

(2)

The instantaneous frequency is only meaningful if the signal
has a single spectral component, which is not the case for the
stethoscope signals. Therefore, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was applied to decompose the signal into simple
components named intrinsic mode functions (IMF) [25]. The
EMD algorithm was implemented with the MATLAB EMD
packaged by Rilling et al. [26]. EMD’s theoretical foundation
is not fully developed, but the EMD can be seen as a filter
bank without predefined band frequencies. The first IMF has
the fastest oscillations and the last IMF the slowest oscillations.
The literature contains several methods for quantification of
the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes [26], [27]. Zhao
et al. used the average weighted Instantaneous frequency for detection of CAD frequency [28]. In the current study, we decomposed the signal into five components. The features calculated
using IFA were: the average weighted frequency [28], variance
of weighted frequency [28], mean amplitude of the five components, mean frequency of the five components, ratio between
mean amplitudes across components, ratio between amplitude
of the first component and the second component, ratio between
mean frequencies across components, and normalized amplitudes (i.e., the amplitude a component divided by the sum of
amplitudes form the five components). In total, 73 IFA features
were estimated from each frequency band.
c) Power in Octave Bands (Oc): A commonly applied
method for spectral analysis of acoustic signals is the Oc analysis. A characteristic of octave filter bands is that the central
frequency of the next frequency band is twice as high as the
previous frequency band. The current filter bank uses one-third
octave filters meaning that each octave was further divided into
n
three bands. The center frequency was calculated as fc = 10 1 0 ,

where n is the band number and the lower and upper corner fre1
quencies of the bands were calculated as fc low corner = fc /2 6
1
and fc high corner = fc 2 6 . The spectral power from the cardiac diastolic and systolic hearts sound decreased with approximately 40 dB per decade; therefore, eighth-order Butterworth
high-pass filters and fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filters
were used.
A total of 4029 features were constructed from the power in
the frequency band 25–1000 Hz, from the single Ocs and from
combing the power from Ocs to broader frequency slots. In
addition, power ratios were calculated between nonoverlapping
Ocs and between frequency bands defined earlier.
2) Signal Complexity Features: Turbulent flow, causing the
CAD murmurs, is of a chaotic nature and may thus alter the
complexity of the heart sounds. Semmlow et al. applied the
Grasberger algorithm for estimation of the correlation dimension and found that the correlation integral in CAD subjects
saturated at low dimensions compared to non-CAD in subjects,
indicating the presence of a low-dimensional chaotic attractor. However, this is in contrast to findings by Schmidt et al.
who found no indications of nonlinear or chaotic characteristics
in carotid murmurs, concluding that cardiovascular murmurs
could be described as a linear stochastic process. To test if CAD
changes signal complexity, the following measures were evaluated: sample entropy (SE), simplicity (Simp), spectral entropy
(SPE), and some simple complexity (SC) measures were examined as follows.
a) Sample Entropy: SE is the negative logarithm of the
conditional probability that a point which repeats itself within
a tolerance of ࢠ in an m dimensional phase space will repeat
itself in an m + 1 dimensional phase space.

SE (m, τ, , ∈) = −log

C (m + 1, τ, , ∈)
C (m, τ, , ∈)


.

(3)

C(m, τ, ∈) is the number of repeating points in the m dimensional phase space. Repeating was defined as points closer in a
Euclidean sense than ࢠ to the examined point. The allowed tolerance ࢠ was 0.2 times the standard deviation of the signal. The
phase space was reconstructed of a vector of m signal points,

D. Classification and Statistics
(4)

SE was calculated using m = 2 and for embedding delays
τ = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 (Samples).
b) Simplicity: The simplicity measure is the inverse of
phase space complexity, where complexity is defined as the
dimension of the underlying dynamic system [29]. This was
measured by overestimating the embedding dimension, calculating the correlation matrix and estimating the eigenvalues λj
from the correlation matrix. If the dimension of the underlying
dynamic system is lower than the embedding dimension redundancy will occur, resulting in rank deficiency in the correlation
matrix, therefore some eigenvalues will be dominant and others
will approach zero. Opposite, if the signal is random, all rows of
the correlation matrix will be independent and the eigenvalues
will spread out. The similarity of the eigenvalues was quantified
using the entropy of the normalized eigenvalues [29]
H=−

k =1

where λ̂j are the eigenvalues normalized to their sum.
A logarithmic base of 2 is used for estimating the number of
average states of the dynamic system
Ω = 2H .

(6)

The simplicity was the inverse of Ω. Simplicity was calculated with embedding dimensions from 2, 4, 8, and 20
to ensure an overestimated embedding dimension and with
τ = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12.
c) Spectral Entropy: If cardiovascular murmurs are a linear
stochastic process, all statistical information is kept in their
power spectral densities (psd). The signal complexity can then
be described by the SPE calculated from the normalized psd,
which was normalized to a total area under the curve of 1,
thereby matching a probability function:

psd (f ) log(psd(f ))
(7)
SPE = −
f

where f is the frequency.
d) Simple Complexity Measures: Some simple measures
of signal complexity such as the number of zero crossings and
the number of turning points were calculated together with the
Hjort parameters [30] “Mobility” and “Complexity:
Mobility =

σ  /σ 
σ
Complexity = 
σ
σ /σ

(8)

where σ is the standard deviation and σ  and σ  are the standard
deviations of the first and second derivatives of the signal.
e) Statistical Moments as Features (SMo): Variance, skewness, and kurtosis were used as features for detection of CAD
by Akay et al. [31] and were therefore estimated in the five
frequency bands.

K-fold cross validation (K = 10) was used to avoid overfitting. Cross validation was used for adjustment of the feature
estimation settings, the selection and test of single features and
the training and validation of the multivariate classifier. The
same set of cross validation folds was used throughout the whole
study. Cross validation was stratified to ensure an equal ratio between CAD and non-CAD in both training and test set. The cross
validation was done at subject level ensuring that all recordings
from the same subject were in the same subset.
The performance of the individual features in both the training
and test set was validated by the area under the receiving operator
characteristic, AUC. The AUC was validated at recording levels.
t-Statistics were applied to test if the AUC were significantly
(α = 0.05) different from 0.5. Since multiple recordings were
used from each subject the standard error was estimated from
the variation across the ten folds [32]. To reduce the risk of type
1 error, the Holm–Bonferroni method was used for iterative
adjustment of the α value.
1) Multivariate Classification: A multivariate classifier
based on a Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) was used
to construct a single CAD-score from several features. The features for the QDA were selected from the feature type which
produced the best AUC across the five frequency bands. The
number of features was reduced by selection of the three best
features from each of the frequency bands. Next, the best subset
was found by an exhaustive search among the remaining features, as the subset with the highest AUC in a sub K- fold cross
validation (K = 10) in the training sets.
Because the QDA assumes normal distributions, the skewness
of the CAD and non-CAD training groups were optimized by
adjusting λ in a simplified Box and Cox power transform [33]:
x (λ) =

(x−τ ) λ −1
λ

λ = 0

x (λ) = log(x − τ ) λ = 0.

(9)

where x is the feature value, x is the transformed feature, τ is an
offset ensuring that x − τ is well larger than zero. The skewness
was calculated for a range of λ from −10 to +10 with intervals
of 0.2 and the λ values which showed the skewness score closest
to zero were chosen.
2) Feature Redundancy: Principle component analyses
(PCA) were performed in order to extract essential information from the features. The ten most dominating components
were extracted from each type of features and from the entire
set of features. The AUC was then calculated for these PCA
components. To compare the main information in the features,
the best discriminating PCA components from each feature type
were compared using spearman rank correlation analyses.
PCA components were also extracted from features in the
different frequency bands in order to extract band related differences.
3) Subgroup Analysis of the CAD-Score: Prior studies have
shown that classifiers for CAD based on heart sounds might
perform differently in males and females [5]. Therefore,
the performance of the multivariate classifier was evaluated

III. RESULTS
In total, 5029 features were analyzed from 435 recordings
obtained from 133 subjects. The features were extracted from
five different frequency bands and grouped in nine types.
A. Settings for Feature Estimation
The noise tolerance α, the start of the analysis window, and
the duration of the analysis window was adjusted individually
for cross validation folds and for the different frequency bands.
Across all frequency bands and cross validation sets, the optimal starting point of the analyzing period was zero samples
after the endpoint of the second heart sound. The most commonly selected duration of the analysis window was 400 ms,
which was the case in 54% of the cross validation folds and frequency bands. In the 250–1000-Hz frequency band, an allowed
variance of four times the median variance was the most optimal threshold for identification of noise subsegments. For the
remaining frequency bands, infinity was chosen as the optimal
threshold, which means that there was no effect of a threshold
in these bands.

were the best performing features, obtaining a maximum AUC
of 0.71. In all ten cross validation folds, the selected AR-feature
consistently was the magnitude of the first pole in a sixth-order
AR model. Fig. 1 shows the power AR-spectra from the 25–
250 Hz band constructed with a sixth-order AR-model. On an
average, the first pole in the sixth-order AR model was located
at 32.2 Hz (SD: 7.2 Hz). In CAD subjects, the pole magnitude
was 0.9934 (SD: 0.0044) and in non-CAD subjects the pole
magnitude was 0.9900 (SD: 0.0056).
The AR-model was the method which obtained the highest
mean AUC across the frequency bands. The Oc features were
the poorest performing of the frequency spectra features. The
power of the third-order Ocs are seen in Fig. 2, were a significant
increase in power is observed at frequencies below 80 Hz in
CAD subjects. The Oc with the largest difference between CAD

and non-CAD subjects was the one centered on 31.5 Hz. The
power difference was 4.85 dB between the CAD and non-CAD
subjects in the 31.5-Hz Oc. The correlation between the best
AR feature and the power in 31.5-Hz Oc was 0.803.
According to a two-way ANOVA, there was no significant
difference among the different types of features, but there were
clearly significant differences among the features from different
frequency bands. The features from the 25–1000-Hz frequency
band had the highest average AUC at 0.673, see Table III, but this
was not significantly higher than the AUC from the 25–250-Hz
and 50–500-Hz frequency bands. The AUC from features in the
125–750 Hz and 250–1000 Hz frequency bands were significantly lower than the features from the three other frequency
bands.
The group of SC features was the most effective complexity
feature, but the difference with the other complexity types was
not statistically significant. In the 50–500-Hz frequency band,
mobility was the selected SC feature in all ten folds.
C. Feature Redundancy
For all feature types, the first principal component was the
component with the highest AUC and is was also the only significant component, see Table III. The mean Spearman correlation between the first PCA components from the different
feature types was 0.837. The least correlated first PCA components were between statistical moments and the Ocs, where
the Spearman correlation was 0.58. The correlation between the
first PCA components from the AR-features and the first PCA
components from the other feature types are shown in the scatter
plots in Fig. 3.
Fig. 4 shows scatter plots between the first PCA components from each frequency band pair. The first PCA components of features from the 25–250, 25–1000, and 50–500 Hz
are well correlated (0.77 < r < 0.94), but the first PCA components from the 125–750 and 250–1000 Hz frequency are gen-

erally weakly correlated with the remaining frequency bands
(0.08 < r < 0.79).
D. Multivariate Classifier
Since the AR features were the type of features with highest
average AUC, the AR features were selected for multivariate
analysis. Due to a high correlation between the dominating information in the 25–250, 25–1000, and the 50–500 Hz band, the
50–500 and 25–1000 Hz frequency band were excluded from
the analysis. The best three features in each of the 25–250, 125–
750, and the 250–1000-Hz frequency bands were selected for
an exhaustive search. Through the exhaustive search, the most
common (in the 10-fold evaluation) subset of features was the
magnitude of the first pole in a sixth-order AR model of the 25–
250 Hz band, the magnitude of the first pole in an eighth-order
AR model of 25–250 Hz band, and the magnitude of the fifth
pole in a tenth-order AR model of the 250–1000-Hz frequency
band. This subset was selected in six out of ten cross validation
folds. The mean frequency of the first pole in the eighth-order
model of the 25–250 Hz band was 31.2 Hz (SD: 6.4 Hz) and
the fifth pole in the tenth-order AR model of the 250–1000 Hz
band was at 1141.2 Hz (SD: 17 Hz).
The mean AUC from the cross validations was 0.73 (95%
CI: 0.685–0.776) for CAD score. The sensitivity was 72% and
specificity was 65.2%. Fig. 5 shows the ROC for a final CAD
score constructed from the most common feature subset.
E. CAD-Score and Subgroups
The histograms in Fig. 6 show the distribution of the CADscore in both genders. The female CAD-score was significantly

quencies increased in CAD subjects. The magnitude of the first
pole in a sixth-order AR model from the 25–250-Hz frequency
band was the best feature to quantify the difference between
non-CAD and CAD subjects (AUC = 0.71). The first pole was
located around 32 Hz and the pole magnitude was increased
significantly in CAD subjects, which shows a relative increase
in low-frequency power. The general trend for all features was
that the frequency bands that included lower frequencies consistently yielded the best performing features. Common for the
best spectral features was that they described an increase in the
power at frequencies in the range 25–60 Hz (see the power in
the Ocs in Fig. 2). According to the octave filter bands, the difference between CAD and non-CAD was approximately 5 dB
at 31.5 Hz.

(p < 0.0001) lower compared to the male CAD-score in both
CAD and non-CAD subjects. Based on cross validation, the
AUC was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.66–0.78) for males and 0.64 (95% CI:
0.52–0.76) for females. Analysis of the selected features shows
that the two features from the 25–250 Hz band performed less
optimal in females. The AUC for the first pole of the sixth-order
AR model was 0.56 in females and 0.70 in males. In contrast,
the AUC for the AR feature from the 250–1000 Hz band was
0.68 in females and 0.60 in males.
In subjects with single vessel disease (43 Subjects and 135
recordings), the AUC was 71.5% and sensitivity was 71.6% in
the cross validation of the CAD-score. In subjects with double
vessel disease (16 Subjects and 55 recordings), the AUC increased to 78.5% and sensitivity to 75.3%. Only four subjects
(14 recordings) did suffer from three vessel diseases, in these
cases the AUC was 56.2% and sensitivity was 50%. The sensitivity to detected single vessel disease in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was 70.85%, 77.0% in circumflex (Cx),
and 67% in the right coronary artery (RCA).
IV. DISCUSSION
The goal of the current study was to identify features from
heart sound recordings with an electronic stethoscope, to be used
for the detection of CAD. A total of 5029 features, within nine
different classes, were extracted from each of 435 recordings, in
five overlapping frequency bands. Cross validation was applied
for selection and validation of the features. The classification
potential of the features was evaluated with the area under the
receiver operating characteristic (AUC). The main finding of the
analysis was that power of diastolic heart sound at lower fre-

The mechanisms behind changes in the low-frequency power
are not known. It might be caused by the coronary murmurs
which is a broad banded signal ranging from low frequencies to
high frequencies (up to 1000 Hz) were the murmur traditionally
are detected [5]. But it is doubtful if the very weak murmurs
can significantly increase the already intense low-frequency
power with 5 dB. A second explanation might be changes in
the resonance frequency of the coronary arteries. Simulations
by Jin-Zhao et al. showed that a resonance of the coronary arteries moves to lower frequencies in the case of CAD [10], but
again it is doubtful if the resonance frequencies from the small
coronary arteries cause the observed power increase. A more
likely source of the increased low-frequency power is changes
of the ventricular filling patterns. It is known that the ventricular
compliance might decreases in CAD subjects [34], [35]. This results in alterations in the ventricular relaxation pattern which is
observable though echocardiographic analysis [36] and in analysis of low-frequency accelerations at the chest wall through an
apexcardiogram or Seismocardiography [37]–[41].
Changes in ventricular compliance are often reflected as S3
and S4 sounds in heart sound recordings. To test if S3 and S4
sounds caused the increase in low-frequency power, a small retrospective study was conducted. The S3 and S4 sounds were
identified by visual screening. S3 sounds were found in 8.6%
of the non-CAD patients and in 15.9% of the CAD patients.
Similarly, S4 sounds were found in 8.6% of the non-CAD patients and in 14.3% of the CAD patients. The mean CAD score
was −0.21 (STD 0.44) in non-CAD subjects without S3 and S4
sounds and −0.12 (STD 0.48) in non-CAD subjects with S3 or
S4 sounds. In CAD subjects, the mean CAD score was, respectively, 0.23 (STD 0.34) and 0.22 (STD 0.37) in subjects with
and without S3 and S4 sounds. Therefore, the S3 and S4 sounds
themself cannot explain the increase in low-frequency power
observed in CAD subjects. Further research must therefore focus on the identification of the mechanisms behind changes in
the low-frequency power.
B. High-Frequency Features
Features from high frequency bands performed poorly in
the current dataset. This is in contradiction with earlier
studies which found that features estimated from frequency

2618

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 11, NOVEMBER 2015

bands above 180 Hz were good discriminators between CAD
and non-CAD subjects. A prior study by the current authors
using the same dataset showed that the high frequency features
were very sensitive to noise [15], which explains the poor performance of the high frequency features in the current study.
The current dataset was recorded in a clinical environment with
a handheld stethoscope, in contrast to earlier studies, where the
recordings were obtained with a custom made sensor in silent
environments under controlled conditions. The current study
confirms that the high frequency murmurs are very difficult
to identify in clinical settings and several approaches must be
taken to handle noise. Typical noise sources were recording
noise, ambient noise, respiration noise, and abdominal noise.
According to the prior study, the most problematic types of
noise were recording noise and ambient noise [15]. The recording noise was typical noise from friction between the skin and
the stethoscope membrane, often characterized as a scratching
sound or as spikes of short duration. The recording noise might
be minimized by changing the design of the sensor and ambient
noise might be reduced by active or passive noise reduction.
But even though several noise reduction approaches are applied, the influence of noise might not be totally eliminated. The
performance of the high-frequency features in clinical settings
might therefore not reach the levels obtained with customized
sensors in sound proof rooms. The combination of low- and
high-frequency features might therefore be essential in order to
obtain higher classification performance.
C. Feature Redundancy
The current analyses included 5029 features, but the PCA
analysis of all features shows that only the first PCA component
out of the ten most dominating components showed a significant difference between CAD subjects and non-CAD subjects.
This indicates a very high degree of redundancy in the features
and that only one component was influential in the current data.
The same observation could be made when the PCA components from the different types of features were analyzed. For
all types of features, the first PCA component was the only
significant PCA component. As seen in Fig. 3, the correlation
between the first PCA components from the different feature
types and the first PCA components from the AR features was
high, which confirms a high degree of redundancy between the
features types. This was further confirmed by the ANOVA analysis which did not show a significant difference in performance
of the different feature types.
D. Combination of Low- and High-Frequency Features
By selecting features from an AR-model, a multivariate classifier was used to generate a CAD score. The AUC of the CAD
score was 0.73. The sensitivity was 72% with a specificity of
65.2%. Even though no significant features were found in the
250–1000 Hz band in the current study, inclusion of features
from this frequency band improved the performance of the CAD
score slightly. Still the contribution of the high-frequency features was very limited due to noise problems. However, if the
described noise problems are reduced, the addition of the high-

frequency features is expected to increase the classification performance significantly. Thereby, the combination of low- and
high-frequency features might be the key to robust and accurate
heart sound based detection of CAD.
E. CAD Score and Subgroups
The subgroup analysis showed that in single vessel disease
subjects, the sensitivity was highest in the Cx artery and lowest
in the RCA. That sensitivity was decreased in RCA stenosis
is in line with both the concept about coronary murmurs and
the concept about changes in ventricle filling patterns. Clearly,
a stenosis located in the proximal Cx or LAD is closer to the
transducer at the fourth intercostal space and thereby is the
coronary murmur more likely to be detected. Similar is a stenosis
in the Cx and LAD more likely to cause changes in the ventricle
filling patterns since these arteries are the main supplier to the
left ventricle. As expected, the analyses also show that patients
with two vessel disease were easier detected compared to subject
with one vessel disease (AUC 78.5% versus 71.5%). The low
sensitivity in three vessel diseased subjects is probably due to
statistical variation, since there were only four subjects with this
condition.
There was a clear gender difference in the CAD score. In
the non-CAD subjects, the females scored significantly lower
compared to males. The female breast increases the distance
between the heart and the stethoscope which might explain the
weaker low-frequency power in females. The genders differences show that further studies must take the gender difference
into account.
F. Clinical Potential
With the current specificity, the CAD score method is clearly
not suited for screening large patient populations. However, the
accuracy of the CAD-score is close to the accuracy of the widely
used ECG exercise test (sensitivity 68% and specificity 77%)
[42]. The CAD score might provide valuable information in
risk estimation. One example could be in combination with the
Framingham risk score. The Framingham risk score defines the
ten-year risk for CAD in three levels: low (<10%), intermediate
(10–20%), and a high (>20%) risk. If, for an illustrative purpose,
the ten-year risk is converted to prevalence the positive predictive value in patients with intermediate risk will be 18.6%–34%
and the negative predictive value 90.3–95.4%. Therefore, nearly
all patients in the intermediate groups can be reclassified to either low risk <10% or high risk >20%. Thereby, appropriate
treatments and examinations can be specified to the patient.
V. CONCLUSION
The current study identified new features, describing changes
in the low frequency part of the signal, for the diagnosis of CAD
patients. Known features from the higher frequencies performed
poorly in the recordings from the electronic stethoscope, which
is probably due to noise from various sources, such as motion
artifact which is a specific problem for the hand-held electronic
stethoscope. By combining features from different frequency

bands using a QDA, a CAD score was calculated. The diagnostic
performance of the current CAD score is close to the widely used
ECG exercise tests, but if the noise problems would be solved the
features from high and low frequency bands might supplement
each other well and thereby improve the performance of the
stethoscope based CAD-score.
