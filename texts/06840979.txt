Abstract—In total liquid ventilation (TLV), the lungs are filled
with a breathable liquid perfluorocarbon (PFC) while a liquid ventilator ensures proper gas exchange by renewal of a tidal volume
of oxygenated and temperature-controlled PFC. Given the rapid
changes in core body temperature generated by TLV using the
lung has a heat exchanger, it is crucial to have accurate and reliable core body temperature monitoring and control. This study
presents the design of a virtual lung temperature sensor to control core temperature. In the first step, the virtual sensor, using
expired PFC to estimate lung temperature noninvasively, was validated both in vitro and in vivo. The virtual lung temperature was
then used to rapidly and automatically control core temperature.
Experimentations were performed using the Inolivent-5.0 liquid
ventilator with a feedback controller to modulate inspired PFC
temperature thereby controlling lung temperature. The in vivo experimental protocol was conducted on seven newborn lambs instrumented with temperature sensors at the femoral artery, pulmonary
artery, oesophagus, right ear drum, and rectum. After stabilization in conventional mechanical ventilation, TLV was initiated with
fast hypothermia induction, followed by slow posthypothermic rewarming for 1 h, then by fast rewarming to normothermia and
finally a second fast hypothermia induction phase. Results showed
that the virtual lung temperature was able to provide an accurate
estimation of systemic arterial temperature. Results also demonstrate that TLV can precisely control core body temperature and
can be favorably compared to extracorporeal circulation in terms
of speed.

I. INTRODUCTION
OTAL liquid ventilation (TLV) is a promising experimental mechanical ventilation method in which the lungs are
completely filled with perfluorocarbons (PFC), a breathable liquid with high O2 and CO2 solubility [1]. A dedicated liquid ventilator ensures gas exchange by renewal of a tidal volume (Vt) of
liquid that is filtered, temperature-controlled, oxygenated, and
free of CO2 [2]. TLV offers many advantages over conventional
mechanical ventilation (CMV), such as the use of lower inflation pressure by increasing lung compliance [3], homogeneous
ventilation [4], antiinflammatory effects [5], and can also induce efficient whole lung lavage [6]. TLV can also be applied
outside of exclusive respiratory support and has shown promise
for ultrafast mild therapeutic hypothermia induction for cardioprotection and neuroprotection [7].
A fundamental difference between TLV and CMV relates
to the fact that PFCs are about 1500 times denser than air.
Consequently, due to their high density, PFCs act as a large heat
capacity, and the lungs become an efficient heat exchanger with
circulating blood [8]. Hence, the lungs (as heat exchanger) and
the blood (as heat carrier) can thus be used to rapidly control
core body temperature. Given the rapid changes in core body
temperature generated by TLV, it is essential to have accurate
and reliable core temperature monitoring and control. As an
example, rapid induction of mild hypothermia by TLV requires
the inspired PFC temperature to be below 30 ◦ C; however, after a
few minutes, the temperature must quickly be increased in order
to avoid a significant negative overshoot of core temperature that
may potentially cause cardiac arrhythmia [9], [10].
The pulmonary artery (PA) temperature is often taken as the
reference source for core body temperature [11]. However, in
liquid ventilation, systemic arterial and oesophageal temperature are the first to vary, well before PA temperature, the latter
being primarily related to systemic venous blood [12]. Arterial
blood, as heat carrier in the body, is cooled or heated by the PFC
as it flows in the alveoli capillaries; however its measurement
is invasive and time consuming. Oesophageal temperature, with
its proximity to the lung, also varies rapidly. While its measurement can easily be obtained by entering a sensor orally in the
oesophagus, it can nevertheless be influenced by the positioning
of the sensor, which in turn may bias the temperature reading
and, if taken as core temperature, could be harmful to the patient
[13]. In TLV, both arterial blood and lung temperature can be
used as reference for core temperature.
The aim of the present study was two fold: 1) to develop a
noninvasive, position-independent, and quick-to-install virtual
lung temperature sensor that is both reliable and accurate for

temperature during fast hypothermia induction and rewarming.

II. MATERIALS AND METHOD
A. Inolivent Liquid Ventilator Prototype
Fig. 1 illustrates the liquid ventilator developed by the Inolivent research team at the Universit de Sherbrooke, QC, Canada
[14]. The Inolivent liquid ventilator technology uses two independent piston pumps to insert and withdraw PFC liquid in the
lungs, with four pinch valves synchronized to guide the PFC
flow in the ventilator (see Fig. 2) [15]. A Y-connector is used
to connect both liquid and conventional ventilator to the endotracheal tube (see Fig. 3). A 0.2 micron filter receives the
expired PFC before it returns in the integrated PFC treatment
unit for hypothermia (PTUh) where the PFC is oxygenated,
CO2 is scrubbed, and its temperature is regulated. The PFC liquid used is perflubron (PFOB) (Fluoromed L.P., USA) of which
the total volume inside the liquid ventilator is 3 l.

Fig. 3. Y-connector allowing to connect both liquid and conventional ventilators to the endotracheal tube.

C. Virtual Lung Temperature Sensor
B. PFC Treatment Unit for Hypothermia
The presented PTUh is an integrated device than can heat
and cool the inspired PFC (see Fig. 2). This PTUh also includes
an Fi O2 regulator (not shown), a condenser to retrieve PFC
vapor, a two-column oxygenator for PFC oxygenation and CO2
removal, and a buffer reservoir. Each column of the PTUh has a
double wall: the exterior wall consisting of polycarbonate and
the inner wall made of stainless steel (thickness 0.8 mm). The
water flowing between the walls is used as a heat carrier for
modulating the temperature of the PFC inside the PTUh. A 6-l
water circulating bath (Model 9100, PolyScience, It) is used to
heat or cool the circulating water.

The Y-connector is equipped with an unsteady flowmeter [16]
and a temperature sensor (GO 1020, Measurement Specialties,
USA) with a short response time (t90% < 0.35 s) (see Fig. 3). A
hole in the Y-connector allows the insertion of the temperature
sensor with two O-rings which fixes the sensor in the PFC flow.
The virtual lung temperature measurement (Tlung ) is recorded
at the end of PFC expiration when PFC flow is zero. Tlung assumes that the temperature of the temperature sensor and its
surroundings has reached thermal equilibrium with the exhaled
PFC at the end of the expiration. The virtual temperature sensor was validated experimentally both in vitro and in vivo as
described below.

D. In Vitro Experiments
In vitro validation of Tlung was performed with water. A thermally insulated container was filled with 3 l of warm water at
37.7 ◦ C. A 4.5-mm cuffed endotracheal tube was connected to
the Y-connector and attached in the container. A temperature
sensor was positioned in the container to measure the temperature of the water (Tcont ) (analogous to lung temperature)
[17]. Inolivent liquid ventilator was used for renewal of a Vt of
temperature-controlled water to cool the 3 l of warm water. TLV
was initiated at a respiratory frequency (f ) of 6 breaths/min and
a Vt of 65 ml, typical values in TLV for newborn lambs (weighing approximately 3 kg), and continued for 20 min.

during the animal experimentation protocol.

E. In Vivo Experiments
The animal experimentation protocol was approved by the
Institutional Ethics Committee for Animal Care and Experimentation. Seven healthy newborn male lambs weighing between 2.8 and 5.8 kg (mean 4.2 ± 1.0 kg) with a body surface
area between 0.17 to 0.27 m2 (mean 0.21 ± 0.04 m2 ) underwent the experimental protocol. The choice of male lambs only
will prevent reported gender-related differences between experimental groups in outcomes from neonatal respiratory distress
[18]. Each newborn lamb was orally intubated with a 4.5-mm
cuffed endotracheal tube and restrained in supine position. The
lamb was then anaesthetized with propofol and ventilated with a
conventional mechanical ventilator (Servo 300, Siemens, Sweden) in a pressure-regulated, volume-controlled mode with a
positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 4 cm H2 O, Vt of
13 ml/kg, and f of 55 breaths/min. A femoral arterial catheter
(PiCCO, Pulsion Medical, Germany) was installed for arterial
blood gas analysis sampling and temperature recording (TFA ). A
Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter (VoLEF, Pulsion Medical,
Germany) was inserted into the proximal PA for temperature
measurements (TPA ). In addition, thermistor temperature sensors (402AC, Measurement Specialties, USA) were inserted in
the oesophagus at the atrial level (To eso ), in the right ear next to
the eardrum (Tear ) and in the rectum at a depth of 5 cm (Trect ).
After a 30-min recovery period, the lamb was paralyzed with
rocuronium bromide and shifted from CMV to TLV using the
Inolivent-5.0 liquid ventilator prototype. Transition was carried
out using one 25 ml/kg volume of 20 ◦ C preoxygenated PFOB.
Hypothermic TLV was performed at the following initial ventilator settings: PEEP = 4 cm H2 O, f = 6.4 breaths/min, and
Vt = 15 ml/kg. Inspiration was volume-regulated while expiration was pressure-regulated; both were volume-controlled,
pressure-limited, and time-cycled. Throughout the first cycles
of TLV, minute ventilation (Vmin) was raised to 130 ml/min/kg.
A graphical representation of the variation in core body temperature during the animal experimentation protocol as well as
the nomenclature of each phase is shown in Fig. 4. The various
phases of the procedure were as follows:
1) Hypo 1: TLV was initiated with fast hypothermia induction to 33.5 ◦ C until stabilization of all body temperatures.
2) Rate 3 ◦ C/h: A gradual rewarming of 3 ◦ C/h was carried
out for 1 h from 33.5 ◦ C to 36.5 ◦ C. The experimental
slopes (m) were estimated by calculating the coefficient

least squares sense, and a correlation coefficient (r2 ) was
calculated.
3) Normo: A rapid heating of the lamb was performed from
36.5 ◦ C to 39.5 ◦ C which is the normothermia for lambs.
4) Hypo 2: After stabilization at normothermia, hypothermia
was again induced to achieve body temperature stabilization at 33.5 ◦ C.
Ventilatory parameters and heart rate were noted at the end
of each phase when all body temperatures were stabilized. Concurrently, blood samples were drawn for PaO2 , PaCO2 and pH
analysis. All results were temperature corrected according to
femoral artery temperature.

F. Body Temperature Control With TLV
With the Inolivent-5.0 liquid ventilator, core body temperature control is achieved by varying the water bath temperature
(Twater ) with Tlung as feedback temperature (see Fig. 6). Varying Twater that passes through the double wall of the PTUh
allows the modulation of the inspired PFC temperature (Tinspi )
and the control Tlung .
The use of a control algorithm (consisting of two nested loops
and a saturation) is required to achieve the desired performance
(see Fig. 6). Targeted core temperature is used as feedforward
and is compared to Tlung . The error on Tlung is fed through a
proportional-integral controller with Kp1 = 6 and T i = 800 s.
From this first loop of the controller, the water temperature
needed to achieve the desired patient temperature is obtained.
When a rapid change in temperature is necessary, the water
temperature setpoint is compared to the measured water bath
temperature, and the error is multiplied by a proportional gain
(Kp2 = 1) to overestimate the temperature setpoint sent to the
water bath. During the slow rewarming phase (Rate 3 ◦ C/h),
this overestimation is unnecessary and the controller gain Kp2
is disabled (Kp2 = 0). The saturation block at the controller
output is used to maintain the water temperature within a range
of 5 ◦ C to 50 ◦ C.
An antiwind-up, not shown on Fig. 6, is added to the integrator
to inhibit its action when the error between the targeted water
temperature and the bath temperature is greater than 5 ◦ C or
less than −3 ◦ C. Under these conditions, it was determined
experimentally that the command is saturated [17].
G. Statistics
To validate the virtual lung temperature sensor in vitro and
in vivo, Tlung was respectively compared to Tcont and TFA .
First, Bland–Altman plots were used to compare the consistency between measurements [19]. The temperature differences
(y-axis) as a function of mean temperature (x-axis) were plotted.
The mean differences and the limits of agreement at 95% were
added to the graphs. In addition, a reliability index with its 95%
confidence interval (CI) was calculated using intraclass correlation [ICC(2,2)] to determine the agreement [20]. A reliability

index of 1 indicates a perfect agreement while 0 indicates poor
agreement.
All results were presented as mean ± standard deviation for
all animals. The Shapiro–Wilk test was primarily used to verify
the normality of each sample. The Student paired t-test was
used to determine the difference between samples and carried
out between Hypo 1 and Normo phases, between Hypo 2 and
Normo phases, and between Hypo 1 and Hypo 2 phases. The
null hypothesis was rejected if p < 0.05. Statistical tests were
performed using the MATLAB statistics toolbox (Mathworks,
USA).
III. RESULTS
A. Virtual Lung Temperature
1) In Vitro Validation: Fig. 7 shows the in vitro Bland–
Altman results comparing Tlung to Tcont . The mean difference
between Tlung and Tcont was 0.06 ◦ C with limits of agreement
at [−0.1 : 0.22] ◦ C. These limits of agreement remained within
the range related to the uncertainty of the temperature sensors
coupled to their electronics (±0.23 ◦ C).
The ICC value of Tlung compared to Tcont was 0.998 with a
CI within [0.996 : 0.999].
2) In Vivo Validation: Fig. 8 shows the Bland–Altman plot
comparing Tlung to TFA in all seven newborn lambs for the entire
TLV protocol. The plot difference between 0.6 ◦ C and 1 ◦ C
is due to one newborn lamb who suffered bronchoconstriction
during the first minute of TLV. The bronchoconstriction limited
the Vt around 38 ml affecting the lung temperature estimation
algorithm because thermal equilibrium was not reached at the
temperature sensor and its surrounding.
The results on all newborn lambs yielded a mean difference of
0.13 ◦ C showing a low bias which remained within the measurement uncertainties between the two temperatures. Moreover, the
narrow limits of agreement of [−0.37 : 0.63] ◦ C demonstrate
that Tlung is a good estimator of the femoral artery temperature
in TLV.

Fig. 9(b) shows that TPA varied slower than To eso , TFA , and
Tlung , while Fig. 9(c) shows that Tear and Trect varied at a
similar rate. Finally, Fig. 9(d) shows that Tinspi was at 20 ◦ C
when TLV began. After approximately 2.5 min, because of the
rapid cooling of Tlung , Tinspi was heated by Twater to reach a
temperature of approximately 31 ◦ C within 10 min. Tinspi was
then heated slowly by the controller to 33.5 ◦ C once all body
temperatures reached the targeted temperature.
Table II presents the mean ± standard deviation of the controller performances achieved in the seven newborn lambs during the Hypo 1 phase. Mild hypothermia (34 ◦ C) was attained
quickly at the lungs (3.2 min), oesophagus (3.5 min), and
femoral artery (3.6 min). The settling time (ts ) of these temperatures was approximately three times higher than the time
to mild hypothermia (th ) due to the negative overshoot (M ).
As observed in Fig. 9, PA temperature varied slowly compared
to both oesophageal and femoral artery temperature. Eardrum
temperature reached hypothermia in 6.6 min and rectal temperature in 15.3 min (th = ts ). Temperatures related to M were
all above 32.7 ◦ C at the femoral artery and above 31.7 ◦ C in
the oesophagus. The steady-state error (ess ) remained between
−0.1 ◦ C and −0.4 ◦ C for all body temperatures.
2) Rate 3 ◦ C/h: Fig. 10 depicts the experimental temperatures while rewarming a newborn lamb at a rate of 3 ◦ C/h from
33.5 ◦ C to 36.5 ◦ C. With the proposed controller (with only one
integrator), there was a slight take-off time before the controller
reacted and began to heat the inspired PFC. Thus, a tracking error appeared between the feedback temperature and the targeted
temperature. While some weak oscillations on Twater and Tinspi
are visible at onset in Fig. 10(d), these oscillations were almost
imperceptible on body temperatures.
Table III shows the means and standard deviations of the
estimated slopes (m) throughout the Rate 3 ◦ C/h phase. The
coefficients of determination (r2 ) of each slope for each animal
were all above 0.98, indicating a strong correlation. The experimental slopes varied from 3 to 3.1 ◦ C/h with a low standard
deviation varying from 0 ◦ C to ±0.1 ◦ C.

3) Normo: Fig. 11 depicts the temperature of the model and
the experimental temperatures during a rapid rewarming of a
newborn lamb. Fig. 11(d) shows that Twater had two different
slopes between 10 and 23 min: a shallow slope from 10 to
18 min and a steep slope from 18 to 23 min. This phenomenon
was caused by the integrated electronics of the water bath. By default, the cooling compressor stops automatically when a rapid
temperature increase is requested. In this experiment, the compressor took more than 10 min to restart from the time a negative
command was sent to the water bath. The oscillation observed
on Tlung at 23 min can be explained by the time taken by the integrator to compensate for the error after the cooling compressor
switched back ON.
Table IV presents the controller performances during the
fast rewarming to normothermia phase. Tlung , TFA , To eso ,
and TPA took less than 20 min to reach normothermia
and stabilize at the targeted core temperature while the

rectal temperature took almost 30 min to reach its target. Normothermia at 39.5 ± 0.5 ◦ C was reached within
28.5 min for all body temperatures without any overshoot. Mean ess remained in the range of [−0.3 : 0.1] ◦ C.
Eardrum temperature could not be evaluated for ts and ess because four out of the seven lambs did not achieve 39 ◦ C at this
site. This was caused by the negative offset of Tear that increased
with core temperature. This offset could also be observed on the
T0 temperature of Hypo 1 and Hypo 2 phases (see Tables II and
V).

Tlung , TFA , TPA , and To eso took approximately two times longer
to reach hypothermia while Tear and Trect took 10% longer
compared to the Hypo 1 phase (see Table II). Although the settling time remained similar, eardrum, PA, and rectal temperature reached mild hypothermia and settled at 9.8, 15.2, and 16.9
min, respectively. Hence, mild hypothermia at 33.5 ± 0.5 ◦ C
was reached within 16.9 min for all body temperatures. The
observed negative overshoot varied from −0.4 ◦ C to −0.8 ◦ C
which was lower than the results observed in the previous phase.
Static errors remained within the same range as for the Hypo 1
phase, varying between −0.1 ◦ C and −0.4 ◦ C.

when the water bath temperature reached 10 ◦ C [see Fig. 12(d)].
Unlike the Hypo 1 phase, Tinspi began at about 39.5 ◦ C due to the
TLV normothermia phase prior to hypothermia induction [see
Fig. 12(d)]. At the beginning of hypothermia induction, even if
Tinspi decreased, Tlung took some time to fall because the cold
inspired PFC was mixed with the residual end expiratory lung
PFC volume at 39.5 ◦ C.
Table V presents the controller performances during experimentation in the seven newborn lambs while Hypo 2 phase.

C. Physiological and Ventilatory Results
Table VI shows the different ventilation parameters and the
results of blood gas analyses for the seven newborn lambs. It
should be noted that arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation remained
above 97% for all blood samples.
The respiratory rate was approximately 8.5 times slower in
TLV than in CMV. However, due to increased compliance, Vt
was approximately doubled for a similar pressure difference
between PEEP and PEIP. However, Vmin was nevertheless reduced by 5.5-fold from gaseous to liquid ventilation.
The HR, PaO2 /FiO2 , PaCO2 , and pH all exhibited a significant difference between the values from mild hypothermia and
normothermia but there were no significant differences between
any of the parameters between the Hypo 1 and Hypo 2 phases.
As a result, it thus appeared easier to obtain a good ventilation
during hypothermic TLV than with normothermic TLV.

IV. DISCUSSION
Precise core body temperature control can be achieved using
TLV. On one hand, in clinical applications, most core temperature variation methods use surface cooling or heating, with a
slow rate of ±1–2 ◦ C/h [21]. With these methods, intravascular
temperature monitoring is unnecessary, and temperature control
does not need to be as accurate because temperature variations
are slow. In these cases, tympanic or rectal temperatures are
often similar to core body temperature. On the other hand, extracorporeal circulation (ECC) can be used to rapidly control
a patient’s temperature; nevertheless, this technique is invasive
given that cannulas are inserted in the veins and/or arteries to
circulate blood in an external heat exchanger. The method benefit, with its invasiveness, from a direct blood temperature contact
to measure core temperature [22]. Although not yet clinically
applicable because no liquid ventilator has been approved for
clinical use, TLV is a fast cooling method which is less invasive
than ECC because no surgical intervention is required. In TLV,
like in ECC, there is a need for accurate and reliable core temperature monitoring. For this reason, a virtual lung temperature
sensor was developed in the present study to monitor lung temperature without invasive instrumentation. This virtual sensor
was further validated to estimate the femoral arterial temperature of newborn lambs undergoing TLV with a small bias of
0.13 ◦ C, an agreement limits within [−0.37 : 0.63] ◦ C, and an
excellent ICC of 0.997.
Virtual lung temperature measurement is a precise indication
of the temperature of the blood leaving the lungs, hence core
body temperature. The virtual temperature sensor provides a
reliable indicator to the user wishing to drive the inspired PFC
temperature manually; alternatively, the virtual lung temperature sensor can also be used to automatically control the PFC
heat exchanger of the liquid ventilator. Of particular interest is
the fact that the two body temperatures that varied as quickly
as the virtual lung temperature were femoral artery and oesophageal temperatures. Hence, even PA temperature, which is
representative of venous blood temperature, is not a good indicator of core temperature in TLV. Unlike arterial and oesophageal
temperature, the virtual lung temperature is able to measure core
body temperature noninvasively and independently to positioning. Nevertheless, a limitation of the virtual lung temperature
sensor is the fact that the latter was validated only at an f around
6.4 breaths/min and a Vt from 55 to 120 ml. A broader range
of f and Vt should therefore be tested to ensure proper functioning of the virtual temperature sensor in all cases involving
newborns.
The present study results showed that the virtual lung temperature can efficiently be used as a core body temperature feedback
to control body temperature in TLV. The controller is driving
the heat exchanger, in this case, the water bath temperature. The
use of an external water circulating bath as heat exchanger does
represent a limitation for this study. Its large inertia and its own
integrated electronics imposed some unconventional means for
driving and controlling the heat exchanger and thus limited the
achievable performances. While the large inertia has the advantage of providing a stable temperature, it can be an issue for

fast temperature variations. During the Hypo 1 phase with newborn lambs weighing less than 5.8 kg, this large inertia problem
could be overcome by initiating the PFC at a lower temperature
(20 ◦ C) than the target. At the beginning of the Hypo 2 phase following normothermic TLV, water temperature must to be low
(10 ◦ C) in order to achieve a fast hypothermia induction that
meets the required specifications. During the Normo phase, the
rewarming speed was limited by the water bath’s inertia and
integrated electronics, which caused the cooling compressor to
stop, thus resulting in controller oscillations.
One of the most appealing applications of rapid core temperature control by TLV is the fast induction of therapeutic hypothermia for neuroprotection and cardioprotection. Mild therapeutic
hypothermia is currently indicated in full-term newborns with
hypoxic ischemic brain injury, as well as in adults following
cardiac arrest from heart attack [23]. While current guidelines
aim reaching mild hypothermia within 6 h of the insult, it should
nonetheless be reached as quickly as possible in order to optimize its neuroprotective effects. Moreover, recent experimental
results in rabbits have demonstrated that ultrafast body cooling
by TLV induces favorable neurological and cardiac outcomes
after cardiac arrest [24], [25]. Conversely, hypothermia can lead
to complications, the first of which is the risk of cardiac arrhythmia and even cardiac arrest [26], [27]. Severe cardiac arrhythmia
is caused by the direct effects of low temperature on the heart
although rare above 30 ◦ C. During the experiments on all seven
newborn lambs herein, all body temperatures remained above
30 ◦ C, and no cardiac arrhythmias were observed. In the two hypothermic phases, the steady-state error of all body temperatures
remained within the narrow range of [−0.4 : −0.1] ◦ C. Mild
hypothermia could hence be reached and all body temperatures
stabilized at 33.5 ± 0.5 ◦ C in less than 20 min. Specifically, mild
hypothermia was reached for the entire body within 15.3 min
during the Hypo 1 phase and 16.9 min during the Hypo 2 phase,
which is faster than the results reported in other studies using
rapid cooling by TLV [8], [25]. This can probably be explained
by the core body temperature controller coupled to the high Vmin
achievable with Inolivent liquid ventilator technology. In other
cases, it may be associated with the physiological differences
between the animal species used for experimentation.
Posthypothermic rewarming is also known to be an important variable influencing the protective effects of therapeutic
hypothermia [28], [29]. In clinical settings, a slope from 0.2 to
0.5 ◦ C/h without fluctuations is recommended to avoid deleterious effects [30]. In the present study, the slope of 3 ◦ C/h was
chosen to represent a significant increase in core temperature for
a relatively short period. It was followed precisely at ±0.1 ◦ C/h.
A lower slope may therefore be followed with similar or better
accuracy.
An additional field of interest for rapid core temperature control with TLV is the fast rewarming from deep hypothermia, for
instance in near-drowning children. Automatic fast rewarming
was achieved in this study with the rewarming of subjects by
3 ◦ C in less than 30 min for the entire body. These rewarming
performances are similar to those obtained by ECC rewarming
[31]. In the case of near-drowning from deep hypothermia, the
patient could benefit from the rapid rewarming, the lung lavage,

NADEAU et al.: CORE BODY TEMPERATURE CONTROL BY TOTAL LIQUID VENTILATION USING A VIRTUAL LUNG TEMPERATURE SENSOR

and the acute respiratory distress syndrome treatment by TLV to
avoid pulmonary complications of water aspiration [32], [33].
Physiological results showed that it is also possible to obtain
better ventilation during a hypothermic TLV compared to a normothermic TLV. This is probably due to decreased metabolism
during hypothermia [10]. Other studies in TLV on newborn
lambs stipulated that to maintain adequate gas exchange, Vmin
should be near 140 ml/min/kg during normothermia or near
125 ml/min/kg with a slight decrease of 2 ◦ C in the core temperature [34], [35]. Even if in TLV compared to CMV, the Vt
is often larger because interfacial tension is reduced and compliance is improved [35], [36], some situations may require to
lower Vt as much as possible in order to minimize the alveolar
pressure and the risk of overinflation to protect the lungs [37].
With the ease in controlling core temperature along with the
decreased metabolism during hypothermia, hypothermic TLV
may therefore represent a good approach to reduce Vt while
maintaining adequate ventilation, hence uniform gas exchange.
V. CONCLUSION
TLV can precisely and rapidly control core body temperature
by varying the inspired PFC temperature. While it can be favorably compared to ECC in terms of speed, it is less invasive. On
the other hand, accurate and reliable temperature monitoring is
essential for the safety of the procedure in order to avoid core
body temperature overshoot which could be deleterious for the
patient. For these reasons, a virtual lung temperature sensor using the expired PFC temperature was developed and validated
herein both in vitro and in vivo. The virtual lung temperature
provided a good estimation of systemic arterial temperature,
thus eliminating the need for intravascular instrumentation to
monitor core temperature. As shown herein, the virtual lung
temperature was also successfully used to automatically and
efficiently control core body temperature in order to perform
ultrafast hypothermia inductions, slow rewarming (at a defined
rate), as well as fast rewarming on a group of newborn lambs.
