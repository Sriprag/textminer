Abstract
Evolution of information production processes (IPPs) can be described by a general transformation function for the sources and
for the items. It generalises the Fellman–Jakobsson transformation which only works on the items.
In this paper the dual informetric theory of this double transformation, defined by the rank-frequency function, is described by,
e.g. determining the new size-frequency function. The special case of power law transformations is studied thereby showing that a
Lotkaian system is transformed into another Lotkaian system, described by a new Lotka exponent. We prove that the new exponent
is smaller (larger) than the original one if and only if the change in the sources is smaller (larger) than that of the items.
Applications to the study of the evolution of networks are given, including cases of deletion of nodes and/or links but also
applications to other fields are given.

1. Introduction
The informetrics of information production processes (IPPs) can be described via the so-called size-frequency
function f:
f : [a, ρm ] → R+ ;

j → f (j)

(1)

where f (j) denotes the density of the sources in item density j: this is the continuous extension for the classical f
(j) = number of sources with j items and we let j ≥ a ≥ 1 also be limited to a maximal item density ρm (see also Egghe,
2005 but there a = 1; here we use a general a > 0 since we have an application of this case—see further). A classical
example is the law of Lotka, where f is then a decreasing power law; this case will also be considered after the general
theory.
The size-frequency function f is equivalent with the rank-frequency function g:
g : [0, T ] → R+ ;

r → g(r)

where f and g are related as
 ρm
−1
r = g (j) =
f (k) dk
j

(3)

where g−1 denotes the inverse function of g. It is clear from (3) that g(r) denotes the item density in the source on rank
density r: this is the continuous extension of the discrete rank-frequency function where g(r) = number of items in the
source on rank r and where T denotes (also in the continuous setting) the total number of sources.
The equivalence of the functions f and g is seen as follows: (3) yields g−1 (hence g), given f and it follows from (3)
that
1
f (j) = −  −1
(4)
g (g (j))
for all j ∈ [a, ρm ], hence f follows from g, showing the equivalency (see also Egghe, 2005). It is also well-known
(see Egghe, 2005 or Egghe and Rousseau, 1990) that, in case f is a decreasing power law (i.e. Lotka’s law), g is the
so-called law of Mandelbrot (which we will describe in detail below).
In Egghe (2004), see also Egghe (2003) one studies positive reinforcement of IPPs, where one applies a transformation ϕ on the function g, i.e. g is transformed into g* = ϕ◦ g, where ϕ has certain properties, e.g. ϕ(x) ≥ x for all x and ϕ
strictly increasing. In Egghe (2003, 2004), the connection of positively reinforced IPPs with linear 3-dimensional informetrics (i.e. the composition of 2 IPPs) is highlighted and the concentration properties of these positively reinforced IPPs
are indicated using the theorem of Fellman and Jakobsson (see Fellman, 1976; Jakobsson, 1976; see also Egghe, 2007).
In Egghe (2003, 2004) and Egghe and Rousseau (2006a), a transformation of g in the following sense has been
studied:
g∗ (r) = B(g(r))c

(5)

ϕ(x) = Bxc )

with B, c > 1 (i.e.
yielding, for Lotkaian IPPs, lower Lotka exponents. In Egghe and Rousseau (2006a) the
extra generalization j ∈ [a,ρm ] with a ≥ 1 is used. In this case the transformation (5) not only leads to lower Lotka
exponents but also to higher minimum density values a > 1. This, in turn, gives a rationale for systems in which sources
do not have a low number of items as is the case for database sizes or country or city sizes. That these cases go together
with low values of the exponent of the Lotka function has been experimentally verified in Egghe and Rousseau (2006a).
Discussions with Cothey (July 2005) revealed that an extra generalization of the above formalism (essentially the
transformation g → ϕ◦ g) is needed. Indeed, the transformation ϕ is a transformation that applies on the item densities
j = g(r) but leaves the source rank densities unchanged. Cothey informed us that the framework of IPPs is well applied
to networks (where sources are nodes and items are hyperlinks: in- or outlinks) but that a model is needed, e.g. to
describe disappearing sources (nodes)—of course still allowing for disappearing items as well. Of course the creation
of sources and items should also be covered.
In view of the above it is clear what to do: the transformation ϕ above, in its full generality, works well to describe
changes (dynamics) of items. So “all we have to do” is to introduce another transformation, called ψ below, in order
to describe the changes (dynamics) of the sources.
In the next section the second transformation ψ will act on the rank densities r. So, instead of the transformation
g∗ (r) = ϕ(g(r))

(6)

we will generalise (6) as follows:
g∗ (r ∗ ) = g∗ (ψ(r)) = ϕ(g(r))

(7)

so that also the source rankings are transformed. This very general model (7) will be studied in the next section and its
equivalent size-frequency function f* will be calculated.
In Section 3, the results obtained will be applied to Lotkaian systems and to transformations ϕ and ψ of power
law type. Also in this case the equivalent size-frequency function f* will be calculated thereby extending the results in
Egghe (2003, 2004) and Egghe and Rousseau (2006a).
Several applications of these results are described in Section 4. The applications go from general IPPs to countries
or city size distributions, database distributions or (as initiated by Cothey) network distributions and their dynamics
(evolutions).

2. General evolutionary model for IPPs
Let us have a first system (IPP) given by f : [a, ρm ] → R+ , j → f (j), as size-frequency function and by its
equivalent (cf. (3), (4)) rank-frequency function g : [0, T ] → R+ , r → g(r). Suppose this system is “changing” into a
∗ ] → R+ , j ∗ → f ∗ (j ∗ ) and g∗ : [0, T ∗ ] → R+ , r ∗ → g∗ (r ∗ ).
new system that we describe by asterisks: f ∗ : [a∗ , ρm
To allow for the largest possible freedom of evolution of the first IPP into the second we allow for a transformation
of the source densities as well as of the item densities as follows: we define
g∗ (r ∗ ) = g∗ (ψ(r)) = ϕ(g(r))

(8)

where
ψ : [0, T ] → [0, T ∗ ];

r → r∗ = ψ(r)

(9)

is differentiable and where
∗
];
ϕ : [a, ρm ] → [a∗ , ρm

j → j ∗ = ϕ(j)

(10)

is differentiable.
Formula (8) describes the general rank-frequency transformation g → g* . The corresponding size-frequency transformation f → f* is given by the next basic theorem.

Theorem 2.1. Formula (8) implies, for all j ∈ [a, ρm ] and j ∗ ∈ [a∗ , ρm

f ∗ (j ∗ ) = f (j)

ψ (g−1 (j))
ϕ (j)

(11)

where j* = ϕ(j) as above (and assuming ϕ = 0).
Proof. By the defining relation (3) we have
 ρm

r = g−1 (j) =

Corollary 2.1. If ψ = Id (i.e. ψ(r) = r for all r ∈ [0,T]) we have, for all j and j* as in Theorem 2.1
f ∗ (j ∗ ) =

f (j)
ϕ (j)

(16)

f (ϕ−1 (j ∗ ))
ϕ (ϕ−1 (j ∗ ))

(17)

Hence,
f ∗ (j ∗ ) =

Proof. This is trivial since ψ = 1 and by (10). 
This special case was already recovered in Egghe (2003, 2004) (for a = a* = 1).
3. Power law transformations in Lotkaian IPPs
Now the obtained results will be applied to Lotkaian IPPs where ϕ and ψ are transformations of power law type.
Lotkaian IPPs are IPPs where we have a decreasing power law for the size-frequency function f:
f (j) =

C
jα

(18)

C > 0 and α > 1 constants, j ∈ [a,ρm ].
Case 3.1 (ρm < ∞). As proved in Egghe and Rousseau (1990) – see also Egghe (2005) – we now have for the
rank-frequency function g (equivalent to f in (18)):
j = g(r) =

E
(1 + Fr)β

with
1
α−1
E = ρm
β=

F=

(20)
(21)

α−1

(22)

1−α
Cρm

Note that the value of a is only implicitly involved in (19), being the lowest possible value for g(r) (i.e. a = g(T)).
In this Lotkaian framework, we will also use (increasing) transformations ϕ and ψ of power type:
r∗ = ψ(r) = Arb
∗

j = ϕ(j) = Bj

c

(r ∈ [0, T ])

(23)

(j ∈ [a, ρm ])

(24)

with A, B, b, c > 0. We now have the transformation
g∗ (r ∗ ) = g∗ (Ar b ) = B(g(r))c

(25)

as follows from (8).
We will now evaluate the form of the transformed size-frequency function f* . By (11) we have, since
ψ (r) = Abr b−1


ϕ (j) = Bcj

(26)

c−1

(27)

that
f ∗ (j ∗ ) = f (j)

Ab(g−1 (j))

Since f is Lotkaian (18) we have (19) and (20) hence
(E/j)α−1 − 1
F
Substituting (29) in (28) yields
r = g−1 (j) =

f ∗ (j ∗ ) =

Note that the expression between [], by (29) and (31) equals Fr.
So, for r ∈ [0,T] large enough we have (since Fr ≈ Fr + 1)
f ∗ (j ∗ ) ≈

δ=

(32)

(33)

and for j* ≥ ϕ(a) = Bac (since j ≥ a). Hence, denoting the intricate constant before 1/j*δ in (32) by G, we have, for large
r (and for all r if b = 1)
f ∗ (j ∗ ) ≈

G
j ∗δ

(34)

with δ as in (33), i.e. Lotka’s law with exponent δ. Note that (34) is an equality if b = 1. So we have proved the following
theorem.
Theorem 3.1. Let ϕ, ψ and f be as in (18), (23) and (24). Then the transformed size-frequency function f* has the
form
f ∗ (j ∗ ) ≈

G
j ∗δ

with δ as in (33), i.e. a Lotkaian size-frequency function where the exponent δ is the function (33) of the exponents b,
c of the transformations ψ and ϕ, respectively, and of α, the Lotka exponent of f and where j* ≥ ϕ(a) = Bac . If b = 1
then ≈ in (34) is an exact equality.
Case 3.2 (ρm = ∞). Next we prove the same result for ρm = ∞. We can now prove that (34) holds with an exact
equality:
Theorem 3.2. Let ϕ, ψ and f be as in (18), (23) and (24) with ρm = ∞. Then the transformed size-frequency function
f* has the form
f ∗ (j ∗ ) =

G
j ∗δ

with δ as in (33) and j* ≥ ϕ(a) = Bac .

Proof. Instead of (19) we now have—see Egghe (2005), Exercise II.2.2.6 or Egghe and Rousseau (2006b) (Appendix)
where a proof is provided:

(37)

it follows from (11), (26), (27) and (37) that
f ∗ (j ∗ ) =

CAb(E/j)(b−1)/β
j α Bcj c−1

(38)

Now (31) yields, using (20)
f ∗ (j ∗ ) =

CAbE(b−1)(α−1) B((α−1)/c)b
δ

cj ∗

(39)

with δ as in (33), exactly and where j* ≥ ϕ(a) = Bac . 
We have the following trivial but important proposition.
Proposition 3.2. In the notation of above, we have
(i) δ < α ⇔ b < c
(ii) δ = α ⇔ b = c
(iii) δ > α ⇔ b > c
Proof. We only prove (i); the proof of (ii) and (iii) is similar. By (33):
δ=

α + c − 1 + (α − 1)(b − 1)
<α
c

iff
α + c − 1 + (α − 1)(b − 1) < αc
iff
(α − 1)(b − 1) < (α − 1)(c − 1)
iff
b<c
since α > 1. 
The interpretation of this corollary is important: Corollary 3.2 gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the
evolution of Lotkaian IPPs to result in higher or lower (or constant) Lotka exponents. In terms of sources and items
this means, by (23) and (24), that Lotka’s exponent δ is decreasing under the transformation (i.e. δ < α) if and only if
the “change” in the sources is smaller than the one in the items (b < c). Analogous for the other assertions. Note also
that if the transformations ϕ and ψ have the same exponents then δ = α, hence Lotka’s exponent remains the same.
Note also that δ = (c + (α − 1)b)/c = 1 + (α − 1)b/c. Hence δ only depends on α and the ratio of the exponents
of the transformations ϕ and ψ.
Summarising Section 3, we have proved that power law transformations ϕ and ψ yield a Lotkaian IPP with exponent
δ as in (33) if the original IPP is Lotkaian with exponent α. As shown in (33), evidently, also the exponents of the
power law transformations are involved. Proposition 3.2 shows that δ and α relate as the exponents of the power law
transformations in the sense that (in)equalities between δ and α are equivalent with similar (in)equalities between the
exponents of the power law transformations.
In the next section we will discuss some (theoretical) applications.

4. Applications
1. No sources are destroyed or created but one has that items can be destroyed (example: no nodes in a network are
destroyed or created but one has the destruction of some in-links). Here A = b = 1 in (23), clearly. We can assume
that the destruction of items follows a random sample in the items, hence sources with a large number of items have
a higher probability for an item deletion, the probability being proportional to the source’s size. This implies c = 1,
0 < B < 1 in (24) (B being 1- sample probability (for destruction)). In this case we have δ = α by (33) and (34) is an
equality since b = 1. We hence refind Lotka’s law with the same α.
2. No sources are deleted (destroyed) or created (A = b = 1) but in a large source, items are deleted more than proportional
to the source’s size. Now we have 0 < c < 1 and B must be choosen small enough to yield less items. Hence (33)
yields δ > α. Indeed
δ=

α+c−1
>α
c

(40)

iff
α + c − 1 > αc
iff
(c − 1)(α − 1) < 0
which is correct since α > 1 and c < 1. Now we experience higher exponent values in Lotka’s law (34) and again the
result is exact since b = 1.
3. No sources are destroyed or created (A = b = 1) but items are destroyed preferably from low-item sources: c > 1 and
B must be taken small enough (and certainly <1) so that we have less sources. The same argument as in 2 now
yields δ < α.
4. The same result (δ < α) was already found in Egghe (2003, 2004) in case of positive reinforcement (and again no
sources are destroyed or created: A = b = 1): now c > 1 and B large enough to have more items. Again, as above, we
have δ < α, as already found in Egghe (2003, 2004). In Egghe and Rousseau (2006a), the same model was used and
in addition one supposed B > 1 yielding (see Theorem 3.1), besides δ < α, that the minimal j* -value a* = ϕ(a) = Bac
is strictly larger than a, the minimal j-value in the original IPP. Repetition of this transformation leads to IPPs
without low productive sources, hence explaining why these IPPs have smaller (δ < α) Lotka exponents: see Egghe
and Rousseau (2006a) for examples (cities/villages, countries and database sizes).
An extension of these results is obtained by considering other possible parameter values, but now leading to increased
source and item totals.
5. Let us have 0 < c ≤ 1 (as in 1 and 2). Source deletion: let b > 1 and A ∈ ]0,1[ such that (see (23))
ψ(T ) = AT b = T ∗ < T
Then it is obvious from (33) and (40) that δ > α. The same is true for source creation (b > 1 and A > 0 such that
ATb = T* > T).
6. If c > 1 and if we have source destruction such that b < 1 (and A such that ψ(T) = ATb = T* < T) we have, by the
argument in 3 and by (33) that δ < α. If 0 < c < 1 we have no conclusion.

An example is given in Rosen and Resnick (1980) on the distribution of city sizes. Here one has the ambiguity
of the definition of “city”. One can use urban places, legal cities or urban agglomerations. In Rosen and Resnick
(1980) one finds an increase of Zipf’s exponent β (there called the Pareto exponent) when going to the larger scale
cities such as urban agglomerations. This boils down to a decrease of the Lotka exponent as indicated here (δ < α).
This is because of the inverse relation (20) (and similar for δ).
In a way, this result generalizes 3 and 4 as well as Egghe (2003, 2004) and Egghe and Rousseau (2006a) (in the
latter article the number of cities remains unchanged).
7. Other examples of δ < α or δ > α can be constructed based on given parameter values A, B, b, c and giving further
insight in the dynamics (evolution) of IPPs. We note, as in Egghe and Rousseau (2006a), that the given models of
source/item creation present a non-stochastic form of general “Success-Breeds-Success” (SBS) principles for this,
see Egghe (2005).
