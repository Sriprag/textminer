Abstract—Parametric probability models are common references for channel characterization. However, the limited number
of samples and uncertainty of the propagation scenario affect the
characterization accuracy of parametric models for body area networks. In this paper, we propose a sparse nonparametric probability model for body area wireless channel characterization. The
path loss and root-mean-square delay, which are significant wireless channel parameters, can be learned from this nonparametric
model. A comparison with available parametric models shows that
the proposed model is very feasible for the body area propagation environment and can be seen as a significant supplement to
parametric approaches.
Index Terms—Body area networks, nonparametric model, radio
propagation, sparsity, support vector.

I. INTRODUCTION
ROBABILITY characterization has been extensively applied in the field of radio propagation. The propagation
environments and mechanisms include the land environment
[1], mobile satellite links [2], indoor environments [3], outdoor
propagation [4], mobile packet radio networks [5], digital mobile radio channels [6], multiple-user mobile radio [7], microcellular mobile radio systems [8], correlated Nakagami-fading
environments [9], and Rayleigh fading channels [10].
Recently, body-centric wireless communications (BCWCs)
have enjoyed significant attention [11], [12]. Body-centric wireless networks consist of a number of nodes and units placed on

the human body or in close proximity, such as on clothing.
These nodes transmit and relay data between each other or with
base units away from the body and other body-centric wireless
networks [13]. BCWCs have been applied in many scenarios,
including low data-rate medical applications and high data-rate
personal entertainment systems. On-body radio channels are a
vitally important aspect of BCWCs and, therefore, need to be
carefully characterized. Accurate radio channel characterization
is a prerequisite for designing on-body communication systems,
which usually include a channel module, synchronization module, and digital–analog converter. Hence, this study develops a
new channel characterization model and demonstrates that the
proposed model is an important supplement to the available
parametric methods.
Sani et al. [14] characterized the on-body ultrawideband
(UWB) channel, and demonstrated that the Nakagami distribution was the optimal model for the root-mean-square (RMS)
delay. In [15], horn-shaped self-complementary antennae and
planar inverted cone antennae were used as transceivers, with
a log-normal model describing the probability of mean excess
delay and RMS delay. Alomainy et al. [16] investigated cumulative probability models for microstrip patch antennae, and
obtained parameters for a log-normal model. Hall et al. [17]
used a theoretical Rayleigh distribution to approximate the relative power level for the waist (Tx) to right-head (Rx) link, and
this Rayleigh model has proved useful in characterizing indoor
and outdoor propagation channels. In [18], the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of both the mean excess delay and
RMS spread delay were derived and compared with a Gaussian
distribution.
Thus, for many propagation environments [1]–[10], parametric probability estimation, which will be introduced later, is the
core method for propagation characterization. However, for the
body-centric scenario [11]–[18], the presence and characteristics of the human body make the rationality of this propagation
characterization mode debatable, and there is very little in the
literature that discusses this problem. By reviewing relevant
literature, we found that supervised and unsupervised parametric estimation are the two major approaches for characterizing
radio propagation in other environments [1]–[10], with parametric methods even used for the on-body scenario [11]–[18].
In supervised estimation, known samples are trained to obtain
an optimal model; unsupervised estimation models the sampled
data directly. The sparse nonparametric model described in this
paper is a supervised learning method. The basic foundation for

YANG et al.: SPARSITY-INSPIRED NONPARAMETRIC PROBABILITY CHARACTERIZATION FOR RADIO PROPAGATION IN BODY AREA

nonparametric probability estimation was developed by Fix and
Hodges [19], whose results were based on the concept that the
value of a probability function at a continuity point can be estimated using the number of sample observations that fall within
a small region about that point. Some breakthroughs in nonparametric probability estimation have been made, such as the
kernel method [20] and K-nearest-neighbors [21]. However, a
large number of samples are necessary to guarantee the accuracy
of the results in these two approaches, but limited radio propagation samples can be collected in the body-centric scenario.
Against this background, Weston et al. [22] proposed that the
support vector technique of solving linear operator equations
could be applied to the problem of probability estimation. This
would reduce the sample size considerably.
In this paper, a sparsity-inspired nonparametric probability
approximation technique is used to characterize radio propagation in the body-centric scenario. The rest of this paper is
organized as follows. Section II introduces the sparse nonparametric probability approximation technique and the proposed
algorithm. Section III presents some results from the proposed
technique and discusses the specificity of the nonparametric
model. In Section IV, we discuss our conclusions.
II. DESCRIPTION OF THE SPARSE NONPARAMETRIC
PROBABILITY ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE
A. Empirical Distribution Function
The distribution function is defined as
 x
F (x) = P (X ≤ x) =
p(t)dt

(1)

−∞

where
 ∞F (x) is the corresponding distribution function. By solving −∞ θ(x − t)p(t)dt = F (x), the probability can be ob1, x > 0
tained, where θ(x) = {
. In the actual body-centric
0, otherwise
scenario, however, F (x) is unknown. Therefore, it is impossible
to calculate p(t) from F (x), and we are faced with the problem
of inferring F (x) from known data. The path loss and the RMS
delay spread in the body-centric scenario are known; they can
be obtained from a finite-difference time-domain simulation or
measurements. As a result, calculating F (x) from known radio propagation data becomes the key to solving the probability
problem in BCWC. Against this background, the empirical distribution function Fl (x), which is an approximation of F (x),
has been introduced [23]:
1
θ(x1 − x1i ) . . . θ(xd − xdi )
l i=1
l

Fl (x) =

(2)

where θ(u) is the step function and x1 , . . . , xl are vectors of
dimension d. Note that when the probability estimation is used
to characterize body-centric radio propagation, the dimension
becomes one and the empirical distribution function can be
written as
Fl (x) =

1

B. Basis Selection: From Orthonormal Basis
to Regression Function
It is generally known that, for a 2-D Euclidean space, the
orthonormal basis is defined as {i = (1, 0), j = (0, 1)} (see
Fig. 1).
Suppose we must represent the straight line l in Fig. 2 (red) using the orthonormal basis. The coefficients for the orthonormal
vectors will be somewhat complex. To decrease the complexity
of the coefficients, the basis should be transformed. In Fig. 2,
the new basis (i , j  ) is adapted to the straight line l, where the
origin of the basis vectors has been moved to the endpoint of
the straight line. As a result, the complexity of the coefficients is
greatly reduced. This simple example illustrates the importance
of a basis selection; it also introduces the problem of choosing the basis for the regression function, whose parameters can
be used to express the corresponding probability. This concept
originates from the Parzen window method [20], in which a
linear combination of the so-called kernel functions forms the
estimated probability function pn (x):


n
x − xi
1 1
ϕ
(4)
pn (x) =
n i=1 hn
hn
where the kernel function ϕ can be seen as the “basis.” However, in the Parzen window method, the number of independent
variables sometimes exceeds that required for a normal fitting.
For the sake of reducing the number of variables, a new kernel
or basis is needed, and this is similar to the basis transformation
mentioned above. Vapnic and Mukherjee [24] represented the
regression problem as
f (xj ) =

N


αi k(xj , xi ) + b

(5)

i=1

where k is the basis and f is the linear combination of the basis.
By applying the appropriate basis, some of the coefficients ai
become zero. This gives a degree of sparsity, which is a big
advantage over the Parzen window method.

C. Finding the Coefficients for the Probability Approximation:
From Regression to Linear Programming
Using (5) to approximate the empirical distribution function mentioned in Section II-A, the problem becomes one of
obtaining the regression coefficients according to the evaluation of results.Vapnic and Mukherjee [24] proposed that
min α1 + 2C N
i=1 ξi could be used as the standard for the
regression assessment, where α1 is the one-norm of α and ξi
are the errors for regression. The corresponding constraints are

where dj are the target values. The number of unknowns should
be greater than zero from a linear programming perspective, and
therefore, we decompose the variable into two parts. At the same
time, we introduce the variable u and convert the inequality into
an equality

The problem, in essence, is to acquire the optimal solution
of 4N + 2 variables under 2N constraints. However, these constraints are only applicable for standard support vector regression [24]. When the regression is used to approximate the empirical distribution function, the constraints must be modified.
First, the coefficient αi should be positive, so that it is not necessary to decompose the variable into two parts. Second, we
define the values of the regression function at 0 and 1, which is
critical for the probability estimation [22]:
f (0) =

αi k(0, xi ) + b = 0

The problem is now to determine the optimal value
of 3N + 1 variables with 2N + 2 constrains. By applying the linear programming technique, we can approximate the empirical distribution function using the data
{(x1 , y1 ), (x2 , y2 ), . . . , (xN , yN )} in the image space. The
main steps are summarized in Alg. 1.
D. Summary
In parametric estimation, a specific functional form is assumed for the probability model, and a number of parameters are optimized by fitting the model to the dataset [25].

YANG et al.: SPARSITY-INSPIRED NONPARAMETRIC PROBABILITY CHARACTERIZATION FOR RADIO PROPAGATION IN BODY AREA

However, when the radio propagation occurs around the human
body, there is no mature probability model to follow. Therefore, nonparametric estimation should be introduced. In nonparametric estimation, no specific functional form is assumed,
and the probability distribution is determined entirely by the data
[21], [25]–[27]. For example, if X1 , X2 , . . . Xn is a random
1-D sample
 from a continuous probability function f , where
f (x) ≥ 0, R f (x) = 1, the general problem is to estimate f
when no formal parametric structure is specified; f is taken to
belong to a large enough family of densities that it cannot be
represented through a finite number of parameters [28]. From
the definition presented above, the nonparametric probability
estimation is in accordance with the actual case of body-centric
wireless channels, which are often affected by factors such as
the human body posture and individual differences.

III. RADIO CHANNEL ANALYSIS AND MODEL PERFORMANCE
A. Path Loss Model for Static Narrowband On-Body Channels
A monopole antenna printed on FR4 board has a total size
of 80 mm × 70 mm, with εr = 4.6 and thickness 1.6 mm [13].
The antenna shows great impedance matching in the 2.4–2.48GHz band, with resonance at 2.4 GHz, and can be used as
a transmitter and receiver. An HP8720ES vector network analyzer was used to measure the frequency domain, with the
objective of obtaining the transmission response between two
printed monopole antennas so that the cable effect could be calibrated. To minimize the effect of the human body on antenna
performance, the distance between monopole antennas and the
human body was set to 4 mm. A standing position was used
as the reference posture during the experiments; some other
postures were also studied to explore the specificity of the nonparametric model. The transmitting antenna was placed at the
left side of the waist, and receiving positions covered the chest,
wrist, back, head, shank, arm, and thigh. The measurements
were performed in an anechoic chamber at Queen Mary, University of London, as a typical laboratory environment is not
sufficient for our objective of minimizing environmental effects
on the probability characterization.
The log-distance model in (11) is sometimes used to characterize radio propagation in wireless body area networks (BANs)
[14]–[18], [29]. However, it should be noted that the rationality
of this model is still a matter of debate [30]
P L = P L0 + 10γ log10

d
+ Xg
d0

(11)

where P L is the path-loss in decibels, P L0 is the path-loss at
reference distance d0 , γ is the path-loss exponent, d is the distance, and Xg is a zero-mean Gaussian random variable. The
premise for applying this parametric model is that the sample
size is large, and this conclusion can be derived from the fact
that the least-squares straight line is usually used to predict the
propagation loss γ, while the least-squares fitting approach itself
needs a large number of samples. For the body-centric scenario,
only a limited number of samples can generally be collected.
Thus, a nonparametric probability model should be established,
because there is no classical parametric model to follow that is

based on a small number of samples. In addition, a nonparametric model that does not require prior knowledge accords with
the actual case of body-area channel characterization. This is
because the body-area channel can be affected by many factors,
and so the function of prior knowledge for the radio propagation around the human body is not as important as in other
propagation environments.
The nonparametric probability should be estimated by approximating the regression in the image space with a mixture of sigmoid functions [22]. Therefore, the sigmoid function
k(xi , xj ) = tanh(axTi xj + r) was used as the kernel in the
probability estimation process. Note that for some parameter
combinations, the kernel matrix Q is not positive semi-definite,
but this condition is necessary for the kernels [31]–[33]. Lin
and Lin [31] concluded that, for a > 0 and r < 0, the kernel
matrix for the sigmoid function is conditionally positive semidefinite when r is small. Thus, we consider a sigmoid function
1
[22]. Kernel functions with specific
of the form k =
1+e −t ( x i −x j )
parameters are shown in Fig. 3.
In Fig. 4, several parametric CDFs are used to approximate
the empirical path-loss distribution function. The figure shows
the log-normal distribution [16], Weibull distribution [17], and
normal distribution [18]. Note that these distributions are all for
the specific scenario of BANs; the propagation model would
change under a different scenario. In view of this situation, we
established a nonparametric characterization of body area radio
propagation, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 presents the regression
function. The mathematical form of the regression function is

i=1 αi k(xj , xi ) + b; only a handful of coefficients
αi are nonzero, which essentially leads to a sparse characterization. Fig. 5 shows the core step for establishing sparse probability models for BANs, where the coefficients αi are then
assigned to the new kernel K to obtain the nonparametric probability function. Note that ε is, to some extent, independent of
other parameters. We therefore define it by modifying an equation in [34]:

C=

l
where ȳ is the mean value of the training output, σy is the standard deviation of the output, and l is the length of the data.
Fig. 5 compares the nonparametric CDFs for radio propagation
in a standing human body with different parameters, where C is
fixed and ε is optimized for the standing human body scenario.
In our case, ε is defined as 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05, respectively. In selecting a nonparametric model, the fitting error and sparse characterization should be considered simultaneously. Therefore, in
the standing human body scenario, ε = 0.1 is an important option. Boxplots comparing nonparametric models and parametric
ones are also very helpful in the model selection: in Fig. 5(a),
the error in the nonparametric CDF model is greater than that
for the parametric models; on the other hand, in Fig. 5(b) and

(c), the errors are less than in existing parametric models. Note
that in Fig. 5(c), although the error given by the nonparametric
CDF model is quite small, the over-fitting problem and principle
of sparsity must be taken into account. For the nonparametric
model shown in Fig. 5, no specific functional form is assumed;
the model is independent of prior knowledge. This characteristic
is quite important in channel modeling for BANs or other variable environments, because the BAN propagation environment
can be affected by many factors. Therefore, the prior models
play a limited role in the modeling of the wave propagation:
in this example, the prior knowledge is only relevant for the
specific subject posture and antenna type.
To further validate the proposed nonparametric model, some
other postures were considered (see Figs. 6 and 7). It is important
to note that the critical coefficients guaranteeing that the nonparametric model error is less than that of parametric methods do

characterization.
B. Nonparametric Probability Model of RMS Delay for Static
On-Body Non-Line-of-Sight UWB Channel
A pair of miniaturized coplanar waveguide-fed tapered slot
antennae [35] were used as the transmitter and receiver. The
coaxial cable connecting the antennae with the VAN had a
length of 5 m. The transmission response was measured in
the frequency range of 3–10 GHz, and the measurement was
performed in an anechoic chamber (Queen Mary, University
of London) to make the probability model more targeted. The
transmission antenna was located on the left-hand side of the
belt, while the receiver antenna was moved along the back of
the human body. A total of 100 receiving positions were used,
with a distance between two adjacent points of 10 cm. Channel
impulse responses were obtained by applying the inverse discrete Fourier transform, with a sampling rate of 1601 frequency
points and sampling time of 50 ps. Channel stability was ob-

models are all parametric, despite having different parameters. In this section, we establish a nonparametric model for a
UWB on-body non-line-of-sight channel. The regression function for the RMS delay spread was established using (5).

model closely approximates the true CDFs for small samples

model error is less than that from the parametric methods. Note
that for the regression function of the CDF, fewer support vectors
(which are also the number of nonzero regression coefficients)
imply that the distribution of the real data is closer to the kernel
function. In this work, the kernel is a sigmoid function. When
the fitting error given by the proposed technique is less than
that of parametric models, this characteristic can be seen as the
specificity and judging mechanism for the sparse nonparametric
model. After determining the kernel function, the sparsity of the
regression coefficients can be used to determine the specificity
of propagation.
From Fig. 10, it is clear that the sparsity of the nonparametric
path-loss models is similar for different postures. This indicates
that the nonparametric characterization for on-body large-scale
fading is stable. In addition, the number of support vectors shows
that the on-body nonparametric path-loss model deviates from
a sigmoid function to some extent. In short, the nonparametric model for on-body path-loss is insensitive to human body
postures, and is not very close to a sigmoid function.
Fig. 11 shows the sparsity of the nonparametric model for
RMS delay. The sparsity level is 3, indicating that the nonparametric model is very close to the sigmoid function. This
illustrates the specificity of the model for RMS delay.
IV. CONCLUSION
A sparsity-inspired nonparametric model was proposed to
characterize body area channels, which are normally analyzed
by existing parametric probability models. The great strength
of this model is that it is independent of prior knowledge, as it
is difficult to obtain sufficient samples for variable propagation
environments such as the human body. Because of the sparsity
of nonzero coefficients, only limited samples need be collected.
This sample size of the order of 102 [36] is also frequently
used for the characterization of WBANs [37]. Finally, the proposed nonparametric models for the frequency domain and time
domain were compared with existing parametric models. The
results demonstrate that, by adjusting the regression coefficients,
the nonparametric models were able to outperform the parametric methods. Thus, our models are extensively applicable for
variable channel characterization.
