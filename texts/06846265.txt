Abstract—The understanding of dose/side-effects relationships
in prostate cancer radiotherapy is crucial to define appropriate individual’s constraints for the therapy planning. Most of the existing
methods to predict side-effects do not fully exploit the rich spatial information conveyed by the three-dimensional planned dose
distributions. We propose a new classification method for threedimensional individuals’ doses, based on a new semi-nonnegative
ICA algorithm to identify patients at risk of presenting rectal bleeding from a population treated for prostate cancer. The method
first determines two bases of vectors from the population data:
the two bases span vector subspaces, which characterize patients
with and without rectal bleeding, respectively. The classification
is then achieved by calculating the distance of a given patient to
the two subspaces. The results, obtained on a cohort of 87 patients
(at two year follow-up) treated with radiotherapy, showed high
performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity.

I. INTRODUCTION
ODERN radiotherapy (RT) techniques, such as intensity
modulated RT (IMRT) and image guided RT (IGRT),
may allow the increase of dose delivered to the target volume
(tumor) [1] but at the expense of the risk of toxicity since neighboring organs may also be over-irradiated [2]–[4]. In the case

of prostate cancer, the considered organs at risk are the bladder and the rectum for which the toxicity events may vary in
time and complexity. For instance, rectal bleeding, stool loosing, and/or urinary incontinence can arise several years after
the end of the treatment. Hence, being able to identify a patient
who likely will suffer from toxicity events at the early planning stage is of paramount importance in terms of treatment
optimization. Understanding the dose–toxicity relationships is,
thus, a central question to manage the therapy by selecting appropriate constraints at the inverse planning step in IMRT. Most
of the current methods addressing the dose-toxicity relationship
issues are based on the three-dimensional planned dose distribution (3DpDD) via the dose–volume histograms (DVHs) [5]
by using radiobiological normal tissue complication probability
(NTCP) models [6]–[9]. In prostate cancer radiotherapy (PCRT)
context, different studies have shown a significant correlation
between dose, volume, and rectal toxicity [10]–[17]. Nevertheless, these studies present some limitations since they have been
solely based on the DVHs: 1) the use of DVHs requires large
databases for the estimation of population specific parameters,
2) different 3DpDD may have similar DVH, and 3) methods
based on DVHs lack spatial accuracy, since they considered the
organs as having homogeneous radio-sensitivity.
Recently, methods have been proposed which addressed
the use of three-dimensional (3D) voxel information.
Buettner et al. [18], [19] proposed a parameterized representation of the 3DpDD to describe its geometrical properties, such
as the eccentricity and its lateral and longitudinal extents. After a
first feature extraction step, a formal classification is performed
using support vector machine (SVM). However, in this method,
there is still a preceding individual feature computation step,
which does not jointly use the voxel information across the
whole population. Exploiting the rich voxel information may
be hampered by the large interindividual anatomical variability.
If all the voxel dose information are to be analyzed across the
population, a previous anatomical alignment and dose mapping
into a common spatial coordinate system is performed. This
is particularly challenging due to the poor soft-tissue contrast,
large inter-individual variability, and differences in bladder and
rectum filling [20], but some registration methods have been
proposed tackling this problem [21]. Following this idea, population analysis and voxel-wise comparison of 3DpDD have been

performed in [22], [23]. Although these approaches enable the
identification of 3D anatomical patterns which may be responsible for toxicity, they do not perform any formal classification
or a prediction of toxicity for a given individual. Thus, new
methods aimed at jointly taking advantage of the 3DpDD, that
reveal the subtle correlation between local dose and toxicity at
a voxel level to classify patients at risk, are still to be devised.
Assuming perfectly aligned 3D images, the principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to extract features for classification from voxel information by considering each voxel as
a decorrelated observation. For instance, PCA has been performed for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction in
the identification of Alzheimer’s disease [24] using positron
emission tomography images. PCA computes an orthogonal basis by maximizing the variance of the coordinates of each 3D
individual image in the subspace spanned by the basis vectors. In
the context of rectal bleeding, PCA is used to analyze nonrigidly
registered dose distributions and classify bleeding patients [25],
[26]. This paper aimed at identifying one basis of orthogonal
vectors from 3DpDD of rectal bleeding and nonrectal bleeding
patients, allowing good classification results. However, PCA is
limited by the orthogonal constraints defined in the problem formulation. This constraint can be relaxed by using more statistical
information from 3DpDD, such as the mutual independence of
the signals of interest (sources) [27]. This leads to the independent component analysis (ICA) concept [28]. ICA has been successfully used for extracting linear feature combinations [29],
[30]. Moreover, in some blind source separation applications,
such as face recognition [31] or tumors classification [32], [33],
the components of the mixing matrix can represent pixels and
they are indeed positive. In order to improve the extraction quality, this nonnegativity property can be exploited, giving rise to
what we call hereafter the semi-nonnegative ICA (SN-ICA).
In our context, the components of the mixing matrix correspond to the intensity of the dose such as a positive value (which
means delivered energy per mass unit at each voxel). In this paper, we propose a new classification procedure, based on a new
SN-ICA algorithm, to characterize rectal bleeding on groups of
patients treated by radiotherapy. More precisely, this procedure
aims at determining two bases from 3DpDD: the first basis characterizes the rectal bleeding and the second one corresponds to
the nonrectal bleeding patients. The classification is achieved
by projecting a new 3D individual planned dose distributions
(pDD) onto both subspaces spanned by the two vector bases.
The new patient is thus classified using the smaller distance to
both subspaces. Tests on real clinical database of 87 patients (13
of them presented rectal bleeding within a two-year follow-up)
and the comparison with some classical methods showed high
performance of the proposed method in terms of sensitivity and
specificity. The obtained results revealed spatial relationships
between the 3DpDD and treatment outcome, paving a way for
the prediction of toxicity in PCRT.
II. CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURE
Our classification procedure involves three steps, namely the
preprocessing step, the training step, and the classification step,
which are summarized in Fig. 1.

1169

A. Preprocessing Step
It is divided into two substeps: 1) data registration and 2) data
structuring.
1) Data Registration: In order to perform a voxel-based statistical analysis, an accurate mapping of the dose distribution
received by the rectum is required. Patient’s planning CT and
dose distributions are nonrigidly registered into a common coordinate system. This nonrigid registration approach advantageously combines information available at the planning step,
namely the 3D anatomical data (individual CTs) and organ manual delineations. Thus, euclidean distance maps from organs
boundaries are built and combined with CT scans to perform
a nonrigid demons registration method based warping as described in [22]. Regarding the single template, it was selected
as the individual closest to all of the remaining individuals. This
typical individual was found by affinity propagation clustering
among a subgroup of randomly selected patients from the whole
database [22]. In our study, we focus on rectal bleeding and only
the registered 3DpDD within the rectum is considered.
2) Data Structuring: Each individual’s 3DpDD is arranged
in a vector by vertically concatenating the rows of all slices.
Thus, we obtained an (N × P (1) ) matrix X(1) for patients
with rectal bleeding and an (N × P (2) ) matrix X(2) for those
without rectal bleeding: P (1) , P (2) , and N represent the number of individuals with rectal bleeding, the number of individuals without rectal bleeding and the number of voxels,
respectively.

B. Training Step
In this step, we first identify from the data two vector
(1)
(1)
(2)
(2)
bases, A(1) = (a1 , . . . , aF ( 1 ) ) and A(2) = (a1 , . . . , aF ( 2 ) ),
spanning two vector subspaces, A(1) and A(2) , that characterize patients with and without rectal bleeding, respectively. The dimensions F (i) (i = {1, 2}) are usually lower
than P (i) . Second, we construct from A(1) and A(2) two
(1)
(1)
sets of subspaces, called ε(1) = {ε1 , . . . , εK } and ε(2) =
(2)
(2)
{ε1 , . . . , εL }. More precisely, we respectively built from
(1)
(1)
A(1) and A(2) two sets I (1) = {E 1 , . . . , E K } and I (2) =
(2)
(2)
(1)
{E 1 , . . . , E L } (where E k , k ∈ {1, . . . , K} is a subbasis
(2)
of rank R(1) , with R(1) ≤ F (1) , and E  ,  ∈ {1, . . . , L},
(2)
(2)
(2)
is of rank R , with R ≤ F ). It is noteworthy that
(i)
(i)
each subspace εj is spanned by a vector subbasis E j .
Two key questions, that will be discussed in details in
Sections II-C and III-B, arise: 1) the calculation of A(1) and
(1)
(2)
A(2) , and 2) the choice of the optimal subbases E k o p t and E  o p t ,
containing the more informative features of A(1) and A(2) , that
better divide the patients in rectal and nonrectal bleeding groups.

C. Classification Step
In order to classify a new patient belonging to the testing set,
its 3D individual pDD, xnew , is orthogonally projected onto
all subspaces of ε(1) and ε(2) , characterizing the two groups

spanning the rectal and nonrectal bleeding subspaces are calculated, and 3) the classification step: the new 3DpDD is orthogonally projected onto both subspaces
and the new patient is classified in the closest group.

not require any evolutive classification method.

without rectal bleeding, respectively. In the sequel, we present
the algorithm in general case, namely to estimate the basis A(i) ,
whatever i ∈ {1, 2}.
A. Problem Formulation
As explained in Section II-A, X (i) contains the 3DpDD of
all patients belonging to the ith group (each individuals 3DpDD
is arranged in a column vector). More particularly, assume that
(i)
(i)
each individual 3DpDD, x(i) [m] = [x1 [m], . . . , xN [m]]T , is
one realization of a N -dimensional random process {x(i) [m]}.
x(i) [m] is modeled as an linear combination of basis vec(i)
(i)
tors (a1 , . . . , aF ( i ) ) whose weights are denoted by s(i) [m] =
(i)

(i)

[s1 [m], . . . , sF ( i ) [m]]T in the subspace A(i) . In our context,
each component of A(i) is represents the intensity value of
the dose and it is indeed positive. In addition, we assume that
the coordinates of x(i) [m] in basis A(i) , namely the elements
of s(i) [m], are independent. So, the problem we tackle in this
paper can be formulated using the SN-ICA one [34], [35].
Problem: Given one realization of a real random vector process {x(i) [m]}, find an (N × F (i) ) matrix A(i) and one realization of a F (i) -dimensional source random process {s(i) [m]},
such that for each index m: x(i) [m] = A(i) s(i) [m], where A(i)
has nonnegative components and s(i) [m] has statistically independent components.

III. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND METHOD

B. SN-ICA Algorithm
As depicted in Fig. 1, the SN-ICA method consists, first, in a
nonnegative compression and a rank estimation step which aims

COLOIGNER et al.: NOVEL CLASSIFICATION METHOD FOR PREDICTION OF RECTAL BLEEDING IN PROSTATE CANCER RADIOTHERAPY

to reduce the dimension of the observation space. The second
step, based on the ELS–ALSsquare algorithm [34], estimates the
bases A(i) , (i ∈ {1, 2}) from the compressed observations.
1) The Nonnegative Compression and Rank Estimation: In
order to reduce the dimension of the observation space, the
nonnegative compression method truncates the N -dimensional
vector x(i) [m] into a vector x̃(i) [m] of rank F (i)  N . The
compressed observations are expressed as follows:
x̃(i) [m] = W (i)  x(i) [m]

(6)

where W (i) of size (N × F (i) ) is the compression matrix. For
the ICA model without nonnegative constraint, the columns of
W (i) are the eigenvectors corresponding to the F (i) largest
eigenvalues of the covariance matrix E(x(i) [m]x(i) [m] ) −
E(x(i) [m])E(x(i) [m] ) and the estimate of the rank, F (i) ,
is determined by the number of eigenvalues not exceedingly
close to zero [36]. However, in our model, such a method cannot guarantee the nonnegativity of the compressed basis matrix
(i)
Ã = W (i)  A(i) , since generally W (i) is not nonnegative. It
is possible to transform W (i) into the nonnegative orthant by
column-pair rotations [37], [38].
In practice, the use of only the rotation transformation is
not sufficient to guarantee the nonnegativity of W (i) . This is
done by the introduction of the shearing transformation on the
pairs of columns of W (i) (see Appendix A for details). Thus,
(i)
if W (i) is nonnegative, the compressed matrix Ã of size
(F (i) × F (i) ) preserves the nonnegativity property of A(i) . The
rank is also estimated by singular value decomposition [36], as
in the common compression. So, the compressed 3D individual
pDD vector, x̃(i) [m] still follows the SN-ICA model: x̃(i) [m] =

a) Alternating Least Squares (ALS) Procedure: ALS procedure is proposed, in order to minimize (10), taken into account
several advantages, such as the decomposition accuracy, the numerical complexity and the memory requirements [39]. The
ALS principle is to reduce the nonlinear minimization problem

To do so, we choose to alternatively minimize the cost func(i)

IV. DATABASE AND VALIDATION RESULTS
A. Database
A total of 87 patients treated for prostate cancer with IMRT
is used to evaluate our classification procedure. The used treatment planning system is Pinnacle V7.4 (Philips Medical System,
Madison, WI). The total prescribed dose is 46 Gy to the seminal vesicles delivered in 4.6 weeks, and 80 Gy to the prostate
delivered in eight weeks. The standard fractionation was of
2 Gy per fraction. The whole treatment and dose constraints
are complied with GETUG 06 recommendations as described
in [47]. The constraints are a maximal dose and a V72 Gy1
lower than 76 Gy and 25% for the rectal wall. The size of the
1 (volume

receiving at least 72 Gy).

images is 512 × 512 pixels in the axial plane, with 1-mm image resolution and 2-mm slice thickness. For each patient, the
organs are manually contoured by the same expert, following
the same standard clinical protocol in radiotherapy. The expert
contour the clinical target (prostate and seminal vesicles) and
the organs at risks (the bladder and the rectum). For each patient, the prescribed dose is computed in a standard treatment
planning system step and then resampled into the CT native
space. The prostate received homogeneously 80 Gy while the
nearby organs at risks received lesser and heterogeneous dose.
The delivery was guided by means of an IGRT protocol, with
cone beam CT images or two orthogonal images (kV or MV
imaging devices), using gold fiducial markers in 57% of patients. The events were defined as rectal bleeding (≥Grade 1),
at least one episode occurring between 6 months and 2 years
after Radiation Therapy. Patients with a history of hemorrhoids
were not allowed to be scored as Grade 1 bleeding. Rectal toxicity was scored according to the Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. Out of 87 patients,
13 presented rectal bleeding (≥grade1) with a follow-up time
of two years.
B. Validation
1) Evaluation Scheme: Because of the reduced number of
patients in our database (especially those suffering from rectal
bleeding, 13 patients), a leave-one-out cross validation is performed to evaluate the proposed classification method. A 3-D
individual pDD is extracted (validation data) and our method
described in Section II is applied to the 86 remaining 3DpDD
(training data). This is repeated such that each patient is used
as a test sample. The performance of the method is evaluated
in terms of Sensitivity (Se) and Specificity (Sp). The Se value
assesses the probability of patients with rectal bleeding being
correctly classified and the Sp value corresponds to the probability of other patients who are correctly identified as without
rectal bleeding.
2) Results: In order to study the performance of the proposed
procedure, we first discuss the impact of the ranks F (1) and F (2)
of A(1) and A(2) . Then, we evaluate the interest of selecting the
(1)
(2)
more informative features, i.e. E k o p t and E  o p t . Eventually, a
comparative study with some classical methods is proposed.

for different couples of ranks and selection of one feature. (a) Se for
(R (1 ) , R (2 ) ) = (1, 1), (b) Sp for (R (1 ) , R (2 ) ) = (1, 1).

a) Influence of the Ranks F (1) and F (2) : Fig. 2(a) and (b)
show the Se and Sp values as a function of F (1) and F (2) , varying
from 3 to 7. In this experiment, the whole vector bases derived
from the SN-ICA algorithm are used. In other words, we assume
(i)
that E opt = A(i) , i = {1, 2}. We remark that for high values of
F (1) ((5 ≤ F (1) ≤ 7) and F (2) (3 ≤ F (2) ≤ 4), all patients are
classified in the group of rectal bleeding: Se = 1 and Sp  0. In
contrary, when F (1) is low (3 ≤ F (1) ≤ 4), we obtain Se  0
and Sp = 1 (all patients are viewed as no rectal bleeding ones).
We also observe that, for 6 ≤ F (1) ≤ 7 and 4 ≤ F (2) ≤ 5, we
obtained quite good results. The best tradeoff between Se and
Sp values seems to be achieved for (F (1) , F (2) ) = (7, 5): only
two patients with rectal bleeding (Se = 0.84) and two patients
without rectal bleeding (Sp = 0.97) are not well classified.
b) Influence of Feature Selection: In this experiment, the
procedure of feature selection is evaluated. Fig. 3(a) and (b)
display the Se and Sp values when varying F (1) and F (2) and
for (R(1) , R(2) ) = (1, 1) (i.e., only one vector of two bases
A(1) and A(2) are selected to form the optimal vector subbases
(1)
(2)
E k o p t and E  o p t ). We show that Sp is equal to 1 whatever
the number of ranks, F(1) and F(2) . In other words, all patients
without rectal bleeding are well classified. The procedure allows
to perfectly classify the two groups (Se = 1 and Sp = 1) for
many couples of ranks. More particularly, it is interesting to
note that for (F(1) , F(2) ) = (4, 4), estimated by the proposed
nonnegative compression algorithm [36] (see Section III- B1)),
the obtained performance is also perfect.
c) Comparison with Classical Algorithms: The proposed
SN-ICA algorithm was also compared to: 1) four unsupervised
classification approaches, namely the PCA-based method presented in [26], a classical ICA-based algorithm [48], a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) based approach [49] and a
K-means clustering algorithm [50], and 2) two supervised methods, namely linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [51], and SVM
[52]. All these methods also take advantage of the spatial information through the use of the registered 3DpDD. The obtained
results (see Table I) show that the SN-ICA classification method
outperforms all the other methods.
V. DISCUSSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Results demonstrated the robustness of the SN-ICA algorithm for the classification of 3DpDD. Although the method

was herein applied to the analysis of doses for predicting radiotherapy side-effects, it can also be directly applied to different
classification problems of nonrigidly aligned 3D voxel data.
The identification of bases combined with orthogonal projection improves the results with respect to the use of only the
orthogonal projections onto the raw population data X (1) and
X (2) . Indeed, using our simple classification scheme without
any vector basis identification leads to very poor performances,
since most of the patients were classified as rectal bleeding
(Se = 1 and Sp = 0.02). In addition, all the supervised methods (which do not explicitly identify vector bases) give poor
results (see Table I).
Two other major contributions in this paper are: 1) the consideration of nonnegativity constraints together with independency,
and 2) the nonnegative compression. The nonnegativity is in line
with the positive character of dose, which is meaningful for this
application. The SN-ICA algorithm allows for the combination
of nonnegative constraints with independent assumption as opposed to PCA, classical ICA and NMF methods, which use
orthogonality, independence and nonnegativity constraints, respectively. Regarding the nonnegative compression, it allows
for the estimation of the best basis ranks F (i) . Moreover, reducing the dimension of the observation space, yields an increased
computational efficiency, without degrading the performance of
the procedure.
Our classification criterion is based on the euclidean norm
and does not require any evolutive classification method. In
addition, a careful selection of more informative features from
the computed bases is also crucial for the classification. With
these data, significantly improved performances are obtained
(Se = 1 and Sp = 1).
The proposed framework also depends on a nonrigid marching organ and CTs scans. The exploitation of euclidean distance
maps from organ boundaries allowed for careful matching of
the dose close to the rectal wall. Nevertheless, further work
will be investigated in the enhancement of the alignment of all
structures. Another key point to consider, in future studies, relies on the optimal template selected from the database to be
representative of a given population.
Although the results are promising in terms of performance,
regarding the clinical application, the results shall be confirmed
with larger databases. Toxicity prediction has been addressed
by a large number of studies using DVHs [6]–[9], which differ from our proposed approach. Despite the lack of spatial

accuracy, these well-established methods provide good prediction results. In future work, a thorough validation against those
models will be performed. One of the issues for this comparison
to be carried out lies in the need of large cohorts to estimate
the population specific parameters. As opposed to them, the
proposed method exploits the rich spatial information encoded
in the 3DpDD yielding a perfect classification. The good performance reveals that classifying rectal bleeding and non rectal
bleeding patients from a population treated for prostate cancer is
possible. Clearly, in this study, we do not claim that the 3DpDD
is the only factor responsible of side-effects. Obviously, it is well
known that the toxicity is also related to specific factors of an individual [16], [17], [53], [54], such as radio-sensitivity, personal
medical history, age, concomitant treatment, etc. Further works
should also consider the inclusion of these individual’s clinical variables that may be involved in toxicity as an additional
criterion within the classification.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a new method for classifying
patient at risk of suffering from rectal bleeding after prostate
cancer radiotherapy. The proposed approach is based on a new
SN-ICA algorithm, which allows for the extraction of more informative features from the 3DpDD. The method exploits the
rich spatial information conveyed by the 3DpDD thanks to the
determination of two bases for both rectal bleeding and non rectal bleeding patients. The classification is then achieved by orthogonally projecting a 3D individual test onto both subspaces
spanned by the more informative vectors. The test patient is
thus classified using an euclidean distance. A comparative study
demonstrates the performance of our method, which provides a
way forward to new means of predicting toxicity. This framework may in turn be used for improving the therapy by introducing new constraints within the IMRT planning, and the SN-ICA
may also constitutes a promising procedure for processing other
image applications where the nonnegative constraints and the
independence assumption are verified.
