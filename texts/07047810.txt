Multiscale Energy and Eigenspace Approach to
Detection and Localization of Myocardial Infarction
L. N. Sharma∗ , R. K. Tripathy, and S. Dandapat, Member, IEEE

Abstract—In this paper, a novel technique on a multiscale energy and eigenspace (MEES) approach is proposed for the detection and localization of myocardial infarction (MI) from multilead
electrocardiogram (ECG). Wavelet decomposition of multilead
ECG signals grossly segments the clinical components at different
subbands. In MI, pathological characteristics such as hypercute
T-wave, inversion of T-wave, changes in ST elevation, or pathological Q-wave are seen in ECG signals. This pathological information
alters the covariance structures of multiscale multivariate matrices
at different scales and the corresponding eigenvalues. The clinically relevant components can be captured by eigenvalues. In this
study, multiscale wavelet energies and eigenvalues of multiscale covariance matrices are used as diagnostic features. Support vector
machines (SVMs) with both linear and radial basis function (RBF)
kernel and K-nearest neighbor are used as classifiers. Datasets,
which include healthy control, and various types of MI, such as
anterior, anteriolateral, anterioseptal, inferior, inferiolateral, and
inferioposterio-lateral, from the PTB diagnostic ECG database are
used for evaluation. The results show that the proposed technique
can successfully detect the MI pathologies. The MEES approach
also helps localize different types of MIs. For MI detection, the
accuracy, the sensitivity, and the specificity values are 96%, 93%,
and 99% respectively. The localization accuracy is 99.58%, using
a multiclass SVM classifier with RBF kernel.

I. INTRODUCTION
YOCARDIAL infarction (MI), commonly known as
heart attack, is due to the occlusion of one of the coronary
arteries or one of its smaller branches [1], [2]. The pathogenesis
for most of the MI cases is due to the progressive atherosclerotic
plaques in coronary arteries. The myocardium loses perfusion
and it is deprived of oxygen and other nutrients. This may also
cause a local blood clot known as thrombus due to deposition
of fibrin, blood platelets, and red blood cells [1]. Sometimes,
thrombolytic substance is detached from the artery and flows to
a distal coronary arterial tree. The consequences are the blocks
in arteries at some other points, which is called coronary embolus. This interrupts the blood flow and results in myocardial

necrosis. Blood samples show elevated cardiac enzymes (biochemical marker of MI) like creatine kinase-MB and cardiac
troponin T [3]–[5]. The elevated levels of above enzymes in
blood serum are noticed only after 6 to 9 h. This time delay can
be avoided by detecting onset of MI directly from the electrocardiogram (ECG). For detection at on-set stage, the ECG of
the patients with suspected MI should be interpreted within 10
min [6].
In a standardized system of 12-lead ECG, each lead views
the heart at a unique angle. This helps localize the pathological
condition. During MI, multilead recordings of heart potentials
will deviate from their standard characteristics. The location
of infarction depends on the coronary artery (Fig. 1, marked
with circle and “D” as an example) that has been occluded.
This evidence can appear in different ECG leads. This requires
simultaneous investigation of all the 12 leads.
Various methods are proposed for the detection of MI. These
include the time-domain method [7], [8], [9], the ST-segment
analysis [10] [11], the wavelet-transform-based method [12],
[13], and the neural network approach [14]–[16]. Some of them
are based on modeling techniques by training and testing the
system. These algorithms use a few ECG leads. Instead of entire ECG segment, the analysis is based on ECG components
such as ST-segment, ST-T complex, etc. This demands for an
accurate detection of ST segments. This requires prior information about the presence of MI in the selected leads. Since various
categories of MI evolved in different leads, it is expected that
monitoring all 12 leads over time will yield a better result in
the detection and localization [6]. In this study, a multiscale
energy and eigenspace (MEES) [17], [18] approach for 12-lead
ECG is proposed for the detection and localization of MI. The
work carried out does not consider the real-time cases with patients suffering from MI. Permission from the medical board is
required for real-time implementation on human subjects. The
results are presented using a standard database to demonstrate
the ability of the proposed method to classify the MI pathology.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The proposed
method is described in Section II, and results are produced in
Section III. A brief conclusion is made in Section IV.
II. METHOD
MI is the genesis of coronary artery disease. In Fig. 1, coronary arteries and their anatomic relations with ECG leads are
shown. The left main coronary artery splits into left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries (see Fig. 1). The
anterior left ventricle (LV), the lateral and posterior LV walls,
the interventricular septum, and the apex get blood supply from
these two arteries. The right coronary artery (RCA) supplies

Coronary arteries of human heart and 12-standard ECG leads in different planes. The probable infarction is marked with circle and D as an example.

blood and nutrients to right ventricle, inferior wall of LV, part
of the posterior wall of the LV through the posterior descending
artery and posterior interventricular septum [1]. The myocardial
injury can occur in any of the above arteries. Various types of
MIs are anterior MI, inferior MI, posterior MI, and left lateral
MI. The ECG leads V1, V2, V3, and V4 show the signatures of
anterior MI and the inferior MI is diagnosed from ECG leads II,
III, and aVF. The pathological characteristics of left lateral MI
are observed from ECG leads I, aVL, V5, and V6. Posterior MI
is due to necrosis in RCA. No ECG lead captures the information of the posterior wall. Hence, it is diagnosed by evaluating
the reciprocal changes in the anterior lead V1. Based on ST
elevation, MIs are categorized as ST-elevated MI (STEMI) and
non-STEMI [5]. The STEMI [19] evolves through the sequence:
1) T-wave peaking (hyperacute T-wave) followed by T-wave
inversion [see Fig. 2(b)];
2) ST-segment elevation [see Fig. 2(c)];
3) appearance of pathological Q-waves [see Fig. 2(d)].
Fig. 2 shows a normal synthetic ECG signal along with three
stages of pathological evolution of MI. The synthetic ECG [see
Fig. 2(a)] is shown only for reference for wave morphologies.

During an infarction, any one of above changes [see Fig. 2(b)–
(d)] may be present in a clinical setting. This shows the significance of evaluation of 12-lead ECG for the detection and
localization of MI.
The section below presents the proposed method for the detection and localization of MI from multilead ECG. In Fig. 3, block
diagrams for detection and localization are shown. The detection block [see Fig. 3 (a)] comprises of preprocessing, multiscale
feature analysis, and classification. The preprocessing involves
filtering and frame-based segmentation. In the filtering part, the
artifacts such as base line wandering and drift are filtered out by
a moving average filter [20]. To remove high-frequency noise,
relative energies of wavelet subbands and a noise variance-based
threshold are used [21]. The frame-based processing of 12-lead
ECG can capture the intrarhythm, intersample, and interlead
correlation information. This information can be used to diagnose various cardiac diseases [11], [22]. In a frame-based
system, data acquisition hardware gathers large number of samples at a higher rate. The detected MI-based multilead ECG
frames will be input to the localization framework. The localization block [see Fig. 3(b)] consists of beat segmentation,

A. Proposed Multiscale Feature Analysis
The multiscale feature analysis involves wavelet transform of
multilead ECG, evaluation of multiscale energy features, and
multiscale eigendecomposition.
1) Wavelet Transform of Multilead ECG: Wavelet analysis
of an ECG signal with J-level decomposition using suitable
mother wavelet gives kth wavelet coefficient at jth level [12].
The dyadic wavelet transform using a multiresolution pyramidal decomposition technique based on a filter bank implementation gives J + 1 subbands. For mth ECG lead, it results with
an approximation subband coefficients, cAm
J,k , at level J and
m
, at level j, where j = 1, 2, ..., J.
with details subbands, cDj,k
The approximation and the detail wavelet coefficients are obtained by the inner product of an input ECG signal with
−J
scaling function φJ,k (n) = 2 2 φ(2−J n − k) and wavelet func−j
tions ψj,k (n) = 2 2 ψ(2−j n − k). The approximation and detail wavelet coefficients for the input signal xm (n) are evaluated

J,k = x (n), φJ,k (n) and cDj,k = x (n), ψj,k (n)
[12], [23]. In this study, a six-level wavelet decomposition is
used. The diagnostic information of an ECG signal is distributed
in different wavelet subbands based on their bandwidth or frequency content. It has been reported that the lower frequency
subbands contain most of the diagnostically significant information of the ECG signal [21], [23]. If all 12-standard ECG
leads are decomposed with same mother wavelet and decomposition levels, it results in similar subbands with an equal
number of coefficients. It helps the formation of multiscale
multivariate matrices [18]. Wavelet coefficients obtained from
all ECG leads with J-level wavelet decomposition are arranged
in J + 1 subband matrices. The columns in a subband matrix
correspond to ECG leads and the rows represent the subband
coefficients. The approximation subband matrix is given by
AJ = [cA1J,k , cA2J,k , ...., cAm
J,k ] and the details subband matri1

number of leads.
2) Multiscale Energy: The multiscale matrices contain grossly segmented diagnostic components of the multilead ECG.

where NJ and Nj are the number of coefficients in approximation and detail subbands. In this study, the multiscale energy
features from cA6,k , cD6,k , cD5,k , and cD4,k subbands are
evaluated. It is seen that the “PQRST” morphologies and its
changes can be captured by multiscale wavelet energies [21],
[23]. The within-class variations of normalized multiscale
wavelet energy for all ECG leads are evaluated using 1074
MI and 1074 healthy control (HC) multilead ECG frames.
These signals are taken from the PTB (Physikalisch-Technische
Bundesanstalt) diagnostic ECG database [24]. The results of MI
and HC are shown in Fig. 4(a)–(d) and (e)–(h), respectively. It is
observed that mean values and variances are different for different classes. For cA6 scale, mean and variance values for lead-I
signal are 0.2 and 0.044, respectively, for MI. For HC, mean and
variance values are 0.115 and 0.008, respectively. For lead-I of
cD6 scale, the mean and variance values are 0.235 and 0.043,
respectively, for MI, while for HC, mean and variance values are
0.117 and 0.010, respectively. Differences in mean and variance
values are observed between MI and HC in all the subbands and
in all the leads. In lead I and aVF along cA6 scale, the differences in mean values between HC and MI are 0.085 and 0.140,
respectively. This may be due to the difference in pathological
frames between lead I and aVF. These differences between the
leads show that MI pathologies can be localized. The above
analysis reveals that these multiscale energy features can help
detect and localize MI pathologies.
3) Multiscale Eigenspace Analysis: If subband matrices AJ
and Dj are subjected to multiscale eigenanalysis, the segmented
diagnostic information is expected to appear more precisely in
eigenspaces. The covariance matrices from mean removed data
are evaluated as [18]

, where m is the ECG lead number [21], [23]. From
each of the multiscale matrices A6 , D6 , D5 , and D4 , six dominant eigenvalues are used as features. Fig. 5 shows a normal
synthetic ECG signal and the reconstructed signals at different
scales with the corresponding spectra. The synthetic ECG signal
is generated based on the dynamic model given in the literature
[25]. It is generated with sampling frequency 500 Hz and mean

heart rate at 60 beats/min. All other parameters are kept default
as in a reference program. Using the cut-and-align method, a
multivariate matrix is formed from the synthetic ECG signal. A
six-level wavelet decomposition is performed using Daubechies
9/7 biorthogonal wavelet filters and subbands are arranged in
multiscale multivariate matrices. The signals are reconstructed
with the eigenvalues only from the same subband matrix. The

SHARMA et al.: MULTISCALE ENERGY AND EIGENSPACE APPROACH TO DETECTION AND LOCALIZATION OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

reconstructed signal and its spectrum of A6 -scale are shown
in Fig. 5(b) and (ii), respectively. The reconstructed signals
show grossly segmented P-wave and T-wave [see Fig. 5(b)].
The center frequency for the spectrum is found at 1.953 Hz [see
Fig. 5(ii)]. The low-frequency part of QRS complexes and the
higher frequency part of P-wave and T-wave are seen in D6 scale [see Fig. 5(c) and (iii)]. The center frequency is 5.859 Hz.
The D5 -scale contains QRS complex and its center frequency
is 10.25 Hz [see Fig. 5(c) and (iv)]. The higher frequency part of
QRS complex is found in D4 -scale [see Fig. 5(e)] and the center
frequency is 17.09 Hz [see Fig. 5(v)]. All other scales D3 – D1
show predominantly the noise part of the signals. These results
show the gross segmentation of clinical information across the
matrices. The subband matrices contain these clinical information. The eigenvalues of the subband matrices can be related to
the clinical information present in the matrices. It is expected
that any variation in diagnostically important components,
P-wave, T-wave, QRS-complex, and ST-segment, will be reflected in eigenvalues. In case of pathology, the low-frequency
components T-wave, ST-segment, and Q-wave appear in lowfrequency subband matrices like A6 , D6 , D5 , and D4 . In this
study, the first six eigenvalues from each of covariance matrix
are used to form feature vectors since most of the energy is
retained by them.
The changes in covariance structures due to various ECG
morphologies result in different eigenvalues. Fig. 6(a) and (b)
shows “LEV versus principal components” for A6 , D6 , D5 ,
and D4 subband matrices, for HC and MI cases. LEV is the
log of eigenvalues. Comparison of results in these two figures
shows that the eigenvalues for MI cases are different from HC
cases. Hence, these eigenvalues can be used as representative
features for clinical information in the signals. Over a large
dataset, changes in eigenvalues are shown in Fig. 7. The withinclass variations of eigenvalues for HC cases at each scale are
shown by the box plot in Fig. 7(a)–(d). Similarly, the withinclass variations of eigenvalues for MI cases at each scale are
shown by the box plot in Fig. 7(e)–(h). For pathological cases,
the mean and variance values of first six principal components
(PCs) at A6 , D6 , D5 , and D4 , differ from the HC cases. For A6
scale, mean and variance values of first PC for MI are 7.3377
and 1.1574, respectively, whereas mean and variance values for
HC are 7.8024 and 1.0712. The difference between mean values
for D5 scale in PC1, PC2, and PC3 are 0.65, 0.3, and 0.26, respectively, between HC and MI. Similar differences are also observed in other scales. These variations are due to the difference
in covariance structures. The covariance structures depend on
the subband diagnostic information and interlead correlations.
The interlead correlations will depend on characteristics of the
signals in the leads. The above analysis shows that the multiscale eigenvalues are suitable for detection and localization MI
pathology. The multiscale energies and eigenvalues capture the
information related to various ECG morphologies. In this study,
the feature vector zi consists of 72-elements which include 48
multiscale wavelet energy elements and 24 eigenvalue elements.
These features are selected from four diagnostically important
scales or subband matrices such as A6 , D6 , D5 , and D4 . The
48 multiscale energy elements and 24 eigenvalues are chosen

1831

from these four subband matrices with 12 energy elements and
six dominant eigenvalues from each subband matrix. This constitutes a MEES feature vector. The statistical significance of the
proposed MEES features is evaluated using the paired student
t-test approach. A feature is said to be “statistically significant,”
if it has higher t-value and lower p-value [26]. In this study,
out of 48 multiscale energy features, ten features have p-value
greater than 0.005 and 37 features have p-value less than 0.001.
These 37 multiscale energy features with lower p-value are statistically significant for MI detection. The QRS-complex and
some part of T-wave information are present in cD5 subband. It
is observed that a maximum of ten out of 12 multiscale energy
features in cD5 subband are significant. Similarly, out of 24 multiscale eigenspace features, 15 features have p-value less than
0.001. These 15 features are statistically significant for detection
of MI. The first three eigenspace features of D4 and D5 scale
have lower p-value. This may be due to the presence of QRScomplex information in both D4 and D5 scales. For choosing an
optimal feature subset, the correlation-based feature selection
(CFS) method is employed [27].
B. Classifiers and Performance Measures
In this study, two classifiers as K-nearest neighbor (KNN)
and support vector machine (SVM) with linear and radial basis
function (RBF) kernel are used for detection and classification.
For localization of different types of myocardial infarction as
anterior (AMI), anteriolateral (ALMI), anterioseptal (ASMI),
inferior (IMI), inferiolateral (ILMI), and inferioposteriolateral
(IPLMI), the multiclass SVM classifier is used. The KNN and
the SVM are supervised learning models, which are used for
identifying the class levels of the test feature vectors. These
classifiers are used for cardiac arrhythmia detection [9], [28].
The SVM is a two-class classifier. It works with an objective
to maximize the hyperplane [29] corresponding to the decision
boundary. The multiclass classification using SVM is accomplished through various multiclass coding techniques like “one
vs one,” “one vs all,” etc. [30]. The feature matrix for multilead
ECG consists of the input, Z ∈ Rp×q with each instance feature
vector zi ∈ Rq , i ∈ 1, 2, ...., p, where p is number of instances.
In this study, the length of feature vector is q and (q = 72). A
fivefold cross-validation scheme is used to select the number
of instances for training and testing of classifiers. The output
for each instance is yi ∈ (−1, 1) for MI detection. For SVM
with nonlinear and nonseparable cases, each input is mapped
to a transformed space with the help of kernel function [29],
[31]. For training set in each fold of cross validation, the primal
optimization problem for SVM corresponds to the maximized
hyperplane [29], [30]. For MI and HC, it is given as

where σ corresponds to the width of Gaussian. C is used to

value of C corresponds to the model with low bias and higher
variance, which can cause data overfitting. A small value of
C corresponds to the model with high bias and low variance,
which causes data under fitting. In this study, the parameter
C = 30 for SVM with linear kernel and paremeters C = 30 and
σ = 0.5 for SVM with RBF kernel are found suitable for the
minimum training error. There is no large fluctuation on testing instances for MI detection and localization for these values.

For the training of KNN classifier, the number of nearest neighbor K = 5 and Euclidean distance metric are used.
The performances of the classifiers are evaluated in terms of
sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. These parameters are estimated by comparing the actual test output and the predicted
output. A confusion matrix visualizes the number of true positives (TPs), false positives (FPs), false negatives (FNs), and true
negatives (TNs) for a classifier. The sensitivity [33] relates to
the ability of trained model to identify positive results of MI.
The sensitivity (SE) is evaluated as [33]

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this study, the standard 12-lead ECG signals are taken from
the PTB diagnostic ECG database [24]. It is a collection of digitized ECG records from healthy volunteers and patients having
different heart diseases at the Department of Cardiology, University Clinic Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany. From 290
subjects, a total number of 549 records are compiled. Individual
record has 12 conventional leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1,
V2, V3, V4, V5, V6) and three Frank leads (VX, VY, VZ). The
sampling rate is 1000 Hz with 16-bit resolution over a range of
16.384 mV. The subjects in different pathologies are—MI: 148;
cardiomyopathy/heart failure: 18; bundle branch block: 15; dysrhythmia: 14; myocardial hypertrophy: 7; valvular heart disease:
6; myocarditis: 4; miscellaneous: 4; and HCs: 52.
A. MI Detection
In this section, MI detection is evaluated using the proposed
method shown in Fig. 3(a). For R-peak detection, Tompkins’s
algorithm is applied [36]. For MI detection, a frame of four ECG
beats from each ECG lead is considered. This covers most of the
characteristics of ECG cycle. A multilead data matrix is formed
with ECG samples as rows and 12 ECG leads as columns.
Wavelet decomposition is carried out using Daubechies 9/7
biorthogonal wavelet filters up to six levels. Datasets related
to HCs (HC) and MI pathologies are evaluated for detection.

The 72-D MEES feature vector is extracted from each of
the multilead data matrix. Each feature vector corresponds to an
instance. This feature vector is used as input for the KNN and the
SVM classifiers. In this study, 200 instances, each from HC and
MI classes, are used for evaluation. To train the classifiers, 100
instances, each from HC and MI pathology, are used. The other
100 instances are used for testing. Table I shows the number of
TP, TN, FP, and FN values for both KNN and SVM classifiers.
It is observed that the SVM classifier with RBF kernel has an
accuracy of 96%, sensitivity of 93%, and specificity of 99%. The
SVM with the linear kernel function and the KNN classifiers
have accuracy values of 89% and 81%, sensitivity values of
90.42% and 85%, and specificity values of 87.69% and 77%,
respectively.
Fig. 8 shows the ROC curves for KNN, SVM with linear kernel, and SVM with RBF kernel classifier. It is noticed that the
area under the ROC curves for KNN, SVM with linear kernel,
and SVM with RBF kernel are 0.82895, 0.88015, and 0.96166,
respectively. To perform cross validation, 2148 instances, each
from MI and HC, are considered. In this study, the fivefold
cross-validation scheme is used for choosing training and testing instances of classifiers. Results are shown with multiscale
energy features, multiscale eigenspace features, MEES features,
and with the feature subset derived using CFS. Table II shows
the performance of KNN and SVM classifiers along each fold.
When multiscale energy features are used, the SVM classifier with RBF kernel produces an average accuracy of 90.14%,
average sensitivity of 88.68%, and average specificity of
91.62%, respectively. Similarly, when multiscale eigenspace
features are used, the SVM classifier with RBF kernel shows
average accuracy of 84.76%, average sensitivity of 83.68%,
and average specificity of 85.85%, respectively. When all the

features are used, the SVM classifier with RBF kernel shows
an average accuracy of 96.15%, average sensitivity of 95.49%,
and average specificity of 96.82%. The SVM with linear kernel
function and the KNN classifiers have average accuracy values
of 88.02% and 82.28%, average sensitivity values of 87.23% and
81.98%, and average specificity values of 88.53% and 82.32%,
respectively, for all the features. When the CFS method is employed, the average accuracy, average sensitivity, and average
specificity values are of 96.83%, 97.23%, and 96.40%, respectively, for the SVM classifier with RBF kernel. It is observed that
the accuracy, the sensitivity, and the specificity values of classifiers are improved with the CFS method. This may be due to
the elimination of the correlated features from the 72-D feature
vector. In this study, the features that are highly correlated with
each other with correlation ratio of 0.9 are eliminated. After the
removal of such redundant features, the 72-D feature vector is
reduced to a new feature vector containing 60 features. Then,
the performance of 60-D new feature vector is evaluated using KNN and SVM classifiers. The performance of SVM with
RBF kernel is better than KNN and SVM with linear kernel
classifiers. The RBF kernel in SVM projects the feature vector

to higher dimensional space [31]. This may be the reason for
the better performance of SVM classifier with RBF kernel for
MI detection. These results show that the MEES-based feature
vector works well for detection of MI pathology.
Most of the methods reported in the literature are beat-specific
and they are based on neural networks and other classifiers.
The proposed MEES feature-based method for MI detection is
compared with the other methods, and the results are shown in
Table III. Results reported in this paper are close to the results
of MI detection in the literature. Some of these methods used
single or fewer ECG leads, which are expected to carry MI
pathologies. The performance of earlier method depends on the
accuracy of detection of ST segments and ST-T complex. The
proposed method does not require a prior segmentation of ST
segments and ST-T complex. The knowledge of the presence of
MI pathology is not necessary as it is based on 12 standard ECG
leads.
B. Localization of MI
MI detection is evaluated as a two-class problem. Localization of MI is a multilabel classification task. In this section,

MI pathologies are localized using the proposed method, which
is depicted in Fig. 3(b). The MI detected multilead data matrix is segmented into multilead beat matrices. In the multilead
beat matrix, the rows consist of single beat ECG samples and
the columns correspond to 12 ECG leads. Six classes of MI
pathologies, AMI, ALMI, ASMI, IMI, ILMI, and IPLMI, are
used for evaluation of the proposed MI localization method.

The 72-D MEES feature vectors are estimated from multilead
beat matrices. These feature vectors are used as input to the
multiclass SVM classifier.
During the training phase of multiclass SVM classifier, 100
instances from each class of MI are considered. A total of 726
unknown instances are evaluated in the testing phase. Tables IV
and V shows the confusion matrix for both linear and RBF
kernel-based multiclass SVM classifiers. It is observed that the
number of TPs is more in RBF kernel multiclass SVM than that
of linear kernel multiclass SVM classifiers. The accuracy for
each of the multiclass classifiers are shown in Table VI. The
classification accuracy of RBF kernel multiclass SVM classifier
is found to be 99.58%, which is more than that of linear kernel
multiclass SVM classifier. This shows that the multiclass SVM
successfully localizes the MI pathology. For MI localization,
the fivefold cross-validation technique is also used for choosing training and testing instances of multiclass SVM classifiers.
Table VII shows the MI localization accuracy of multiclass SVM
classifier with linear and RBF kernel considering all features and
feature subset using CFS along each fold. The highest average
accuracy of 99.66% is found using multiclass SVM with RBF
kernel for feature set using CFS. For the MI localization case,
the SVM classifier with RBF kernel produces an average accuracy value of 97% for the multiscale energy features. When
the multiscale eigenspace features are used, the SVM classifier
shows an average accuracy of 93.60%. The average accuracy
value for combined MEES features is 99.27%, which is higher
than the performance of individual feature sets. The higher accuracy values obtained using CFS is due to the elimination of
redundant features. From this above observations, it can be concluded that the proposed MEES approach is effective to localize
MI using 12 lead ECG.
The proposed algorithm is implemented in MATLAB 2010a
software in Windows platform on a desktop computer having

1836

Intel i5 processor (@3.20 GHz) and 4-GB RAM. The computational times for each stage of MI detection and localization
are shown in Table VIII. The training stage of the classifier
takes highest time for both detection and localization, 56.67 and
58.5 s, respectively. The lowest time, 0.025 s, is required in the
testing stage of localization.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for the detection
and localization of MI from multilead ECG. Most of the present
works are based on fewer ECG leads, which are expected to
have MI characteristics. The proposed MI detection and localization approach from multilead ECG does not require any
prior information about the pathologies in leads. This approach
is based on the evaluation of multiscale energy and MEES features. Analysis with number of data shows that these features
are capable of not only discriminating HC and MI, but also they
can differentiate between different types MI pathologies. For MI
detection, the multilead data matrix is used. The performance of
MEES feature vector is evaluated using KNN and SVM classifiers with linear and RBF kernel functions. For localization, the
MI-detected multilead data matrix is divided into multilead beat
matrices. Various pathological MI cases such as AMI, ALMI,
ASMI, IMI, ILMI, and IPLMI are used for detection and localization. The MEES features shows an accuracy of 96% for
MI detection using an SVM classifier with RBF kernel. A localization accuracy of 99.58% is found. The proposed method
is simpler compared to earlier method for MI detection. This
method does not require prior detection of ST segment.
