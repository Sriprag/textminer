in Older Fallers

Abstract—Objectives: Develop algorithms to detect gait impairments remotely using data from freely worn devices during longterm monitoring. Identify statistical models that describe how gait
performances are distributed over several weeks. Determine the
data window required to reliably assess an increased propensity
for falling. Methods: 1085 days of walking data were collected
from eighteen independent-living older people (mean age 83 years)
using a freely worn pendant sensor (housing a triaxial accelerometer and pressure sensor). Statistical distributions from several
accelerometer-derived gait features (encompassing quantity, exposure, intensity, and quality) were compared for those with and
without a history of falling. Results: Participants completed more
short walks relative to long walks, as approximated by a power
law. Walks less than 13.1 s comprised 50% of exposure to walkingrelated falls. Daily-life cadence was bimodal and step-time variability followed a log-normal distribution. Fallers took significantly
fewer steps per walk and had relatively more exposure from short
walks and greater mode of step-time variability. Conclusions: Using
a freely worn device and wavelet-based analysis tools allowed longterm monitoring of walks greater than or equal to three steps. In
older people, short walks constitute a large proportion of exposure
to falls. To identify fallers, mode of variability may be a better measure of central tendency than mean of variability. A week’s monitoring is sufficient to reliably assess the long-term propensity for
falling. Significance: Statistical distributions of gait performances
provide a reference for future wearable device development and
research into the complex relationships between daily-life walking
patterns, morbidity, and falls.

and economic implications [1]. Home-based walking provides
both exercise and independence, but the benefits for all older
people are less certain. Some studies have reported that active
older people have fewer falls [2], but many falls are caused
during walking or short transfer movements [3], and a systematic
review found that walking only interventions may increase fall
rates [4].
In the clinic, gait is assessed with a person walking a short
distance in a straight line, often relying on subjective observation methods. Older people who fall are more likely to be
slower [5] and have greater variability of step times [6] and reduced gait smoothness [7] during these assessments. However,
compared with clinical gait, usual gait is slower, less intense,
and more variable [8]. Furthermore, it is not known how usual
walking patterns are distributed during activities of daily life
(ADL). Falls are a complex multifactorial problem [9]–[11] and
before designing and/or assessing the effects of new individually targeted fall prevention programs, objective and long-term
measurements of walking patterns during ADL are required.
Long-term remote monitoring using wearable devices may
provide new ways to further understanding of the tradeoffs between increased exposure to falls during upright ambulation,
age, health, executive function, anxiety, depression, frailty, concern about falling, processing speed, and protective behavior
[9], [12].
Advances in wearable devices make remote monitoring possible [13]–[16]. In the past few years, the number of health and activity monitors available has proliferated. However, most come
as “black-box” solutions, and few commercial devices have had
independent scientific validation published. Using body-fixed
devices, associations have been reported between fall events
and increased step-to-step consistency [17], local dynamic stability, gait smoothness, slope of dominant frequency [18], and
average walking bout duration [19]. However, people may prefer discrete [20], self-adjustable devices, concealable by clothing [21]. Acceptance of pendant devices by older independent
living people may be inferred from the many pendant-based
Personal Emergency Response Systems that are commercially
available.
Furthermore, consensus has yet to be reached on what movement duration constitutes a walk (varying from three steps to
60 s) or the number of days that should be monitored (varying
from one day to one week) [17]–[19], [22]. Older people may undertake over 100 walks each day (see Fig. 1) and different to the
analysis of repeat walks in controlled clinical settings, it should
not be assumed that central values best represent performance,

disorder); and 3) insufficient English language skills. All participants gave written informed consent prior to inclusion. Approval was given by the Human Research Ethics Committee of
the University of New South Wales. Fallers were defined by a
self-reported history of one or more falls in the past 12 months.
B. Remote Gait Monitoring

or that walks of all lengths contribute equally to falls exposure,
without first investigating how these different types of walking
are distributed.
Objectives of this paper were to: 1) develop algorithms to detect gait impairments remotely using data from freely worn devices during long-term monitoring; 2) identify statistical models
that describe how gait performances are distributed over several
weeks; and 3) determine how many days of data are required
to reliably assess gait impairments associated with an increased
propensity for falling in independent living older people.
In this descriptive study, data from 1085 days of walking were
collected from 18 older people using a freely worn pendent sensor. Statistical distributions of gait performances from several
accelerometer-derived features (comprising the gait domains of
quantity, exposure, intensity, and quality) were investigated for
measurement stability and described for those with and without
a history of falling.
II. METHODS
A. Participants
The 18 participants were independent-living older people
(83.4 years, SD 7.0) and recruited from Sydney, Australia (see
Table I). Individuals were eligible if they were: 1) aged 65 years

Participants received the Senior Mobility Monitor (SMM)
research prototype from Philips Research Europe, Netherlands.
The SMM is a small (39.5 × 12.0 × 63.5 mm) pendent sensor
containing a 3D-accelerometer and a barometer. Acceleration
data were sampled at the default rate of 50 Hz with a range
of ±8 gravitational acceleration (g), and the barometer was
sampled at the default rate of 25 Hz.
Participants were instructed to wear the SMM at sternum
height as much as possible during waking hours. Data from
daily-life walking over 14 weeks (see Fig. 1) were analyzed
using a wavelet-based decision tree algorithm designed for remote monitoring [8]. Analyses were completed in MATLAB,
version 2013a. Example walking data and the MATLAB algorithms to fit the distributions described in the following methods
are provided as supplementary material.
C. Analysis of Daily-Life Walking Patterns
Walks were defined by consecutive heel strikes identified by
vertical acceleration peaks in the level 4 and 5 Daubechies fifthorder wavelet decomposition. The analysis of walking patterns
encompassed four gait domains: quantity, exposure, intensity,
and quality. The distribution analyses of quantity and exposure
used walks greater than or equal to three steps, and the analyses
of intensity and quality used walks greater than or equal to eight
steps.
Gait quantity was investigated in the log–log domain because
the distribution of walk lengths covered several orders of magnitude (see Fig. 2). Participants completed many short walks
and fewer longer walks. This relationship was best described
by a curve fitted to the log–log transformed data (see insert for
equation in Fig. 2). Daily-life gait quantity was quantified by:
1) steps per day (from walks ࣙ3 steps); 2) walks per day (of
walks ࣙ8 steps); 3) steps per walk (mean of walks ࣙ8 steps);
and iv) longest walk per day.

power law relationship was observed for walk lengths of approximately 10–100
steps, defined by a straight line on the log–log plot. Panel B shows the group
distributions. Nonfallers completed more walks of all lengths, a difference that
increased with walk length.

Cumulative exposure from ambulation (see Fig. 3) was calculated (1). For each point on the cumulative distribution graph
(Xi ), all walks durations (d) of lesser or equal to duration (di )
were summed then divided by the total duration of all walks.
Daily-life cumulative exposure (from walks ࣙ3 steps) was quantified by: 1) exposure from walks less than 7 s; 2) walk duration
at 50% exposure; and 3) exposure from walks less than 60 s

Before investigating the distributions of gait intensity and
gait quality, each walk greater than or equal to eight steps was
weighted by the number of steps taken for that walk; therefore,
for example, a 100-step walk had four times the influence of
a 25-step walk in the subsequent analyses. Consequently, the
following distributions (see Figs. 4 and 5) were constructed
using the proportion of total steps taken (as a percentage) on
the vertical axis. For each of these histograms, the sum of all
bar heights equals 100%, representing all steps taken by an
individual.

clear separation between slow walking (88 steps/min) and fast walking (112
steps/min) was observed. The bottom panel shows in eight out of 18 participants
clear separation between cadence modes was observed (defined by an Ashman’s
D of greater than 2).

Gait intensity comprised measures of cadence (steps/min)
and vigor using the root mean squared (RMS) vertical (VT)
oscillation velocity [23]. The bimodal cadence distribution was
investigated by mixing two normal distributions (2) to fit the
cadence histogram (see Fig. 4). MATLAB’s optimization toolbox was used to optimize the two distributions (g) by adjusting
the two modes (μ1 , μ2 ), two standard deviations (σ1 , σ1 ), and a
mixing parameter (α). Bin size for the cadence histogram was
held constant at one step per minute
f (x) = αg(μ1 , σ1 , x) + (1 − α)g(μ2 , σ2 , x).

Clear separation between modes was defined by an Ashman’s
D of greater than 2 (3) [24]. Daily-life cadence was quantified

III. RESULTS
A. Participant Characteristics
Eleven participants reported no falls in the past year. Four
participants reported one fall, two reported two falls, and one
reported five falls. Fallers were all female, were shorter, and had
more comorbidities, but were of similar age, weight, and took a
similar number of mediations (see Table I).

On average, 58 days data were collected from each participant
(see Fig. 1). Nonfallers wore the device more (67 days, SD
29) than fallers (44 days, SD 29), but this difference was not
significant (p = 0.1). Days when the device was not worn or the
device failed to record were not analyzed.
Distributions of walk lengths varied between participants and
encompassed several orders of magnitude (see Fig. 2). Walk
lengths were observed to approximate a power law distribution
for around 10–100 steps (as defined by a straight line in the
log–log domain). In panel A, the nonfaller completed more
walks (visualized by the vertical shift to the line of best fit).
Also, a greater proportion of the nonfaller’s walks were longer
(visualized by the flatter line of best fit) and closer to a simple
power law, as defined by a log-exponent (log10 (X)1.5 ) closer to
unity relative to the faller’s log-exponent (log10 (X)2.1 ). Panel B
shows group separation between fallers and nonfallers increased
with walk length.
Fig. 3 shows the cumulative exposure from ambulation. In
our sample, 89.2% of exposure resulted from walks of 60 s or
less, and 50% of exposure resulted from walks of 13.1 s or less.
Cumulative exposure differed between fallers and nonfallers.
The steepest rise in exposure was observed at 7 s. Fallers had
a significantly (p = 0.01) greater proportion of exposure (27%)
than nonfallers (22%) from walks less than 7 s (see Table II).
Only nonfallers performed walks greater than 300 s.
In daily life, cadence was often observed to follow a bimodal
distribution (see Fig. 4). Step-time variability was observed to
follow a log-normal distribution (see Fig. 5). Fallers had significantly (p = 0.04) greater mode of variability (0.12 s) than
nonfallers (0.08 s). The mean of variability was skewed by the
long tails and showed no significant difference between fallers
and nonfallers (p = 0.10).
Summary statistics for 12 gait parameters are provided in
Table II. Compared to nonfallers, fallers demonstrated significantly (p ≤ 0.05) fewer steps per walk, were less able to

C. Gait Parameter Measurement Stability
Measurement stability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC(2,1), Table III). The number of walks
varied considerably day-to-day (see Fig. 1, panel A), which
reduced daily ICC values. Averaging performances over each
week enabled longer term trends to be observed (see Fig. 1,
panel B) and provided higher intraclass correlations.
IV. DISCUSSION
A. Main Findings
Long-term gait monitoring for walks greater than or equal to
three steps was possible using the freely worn pendant device.
The wavelet-based analysis algorithms provided new insights
into the statistical distributions of gait performances during ADL
and how unstable walking patterns may predispose some older
people to falls.
Older people completed orders of magnitude more shorter
walks relative to longer walks and the distribution approximated
a power law for walks between 10 and 100 steps (see Fig. 2).
Our findings with respect to exposure to falling support observations that many falls occur while upright and are caused by
incorrect weight-shifting during transfer movements or walking
[3]. Therefore, future interventions targeting fall injury prevention might consider placing greater emphasis on exercises that
develop appropriate movement strategies and improve dynamic
balance during short transfer movements.
Normal distributions should not be assumed for measures
of daily-life gait performance. Cadence was observed to be
bimodal (see Fig. 4) and step-time variability was observed
to have a log-normal distribution (see Fig. 5). Compared to
nonfallers, fallers demonstrated significantly fewer steps per
walk, had relatively more exposure from short walks, had a

B. Comparisons With Other Remote Gait Monitoring Studies
With respect to predicting an increased propensity for falling
in independent living older people, one week’s monitoring may
provide sufficient reliability to inform future interventions that
target fall injuries. In agreement with research using a fixed belt
sensor [22], we found that for the freely worn pendant device,
one week of monitoring was sufficient for stable measurement
of gait quantity or exposure, and three days was sufficient for
gait intensity and gait quality.
The analysis of exposure from walking (see Fig. 3) highlights
the importance of considering short walks and upright transfers
when assessing exposure to fall risk. However, accurate detection of shorter walks while maintaining low false positive errors
remains a technical challenge [8]. Therefore, to improve accuracy, the pendant device included a barometer, which enabled rejection of short movements associated with postural transitions
if they included height changes greater than expected during
normal ambulation.
We observed 50% of exposure resulted from walks of 13.1 s
or less. Previous studies have used different definitions to define
bouts of walking including: movement thresholds of 10 s [18],
60 s [17], and three steps [19]. In the context of understanding
daily-life walking patterns, movement thresholds of 10 and 60 s
may omit 40% and 89% of all walks, respectively (see Fig. 3).
On the other hand, walks of only three steps comprise mainly
of gait initiation [26], making comparisons with longer steadystate walks difficult.
The ability to identify walks in daily life may be overestimated [27] and dropping the threshold for a walk below six
steps increases false positive errors [8]. Therefore, to analyze
gait intensity and gait quality, we chose a threshold of eight
consecutive steps, which we considered to be a balanced inclusion of more walks against low false positive errors and robust
calculations of gait characteristics. However, to count the total
number of steps and to analyze exposure during upright movements, we chose a threshold of three consecutive steps.
A previous study of older people with dementia reported that
fallers completed fewer long walks and had shorter average
walk durations than nonfallers [19]. In our study, the fallers
took significantly fewer steps per walk and none completed
walks longer than 300 s. Fallers also took fewer steps per day
(2907) than nonfallers (4127), but this trend was not significant.
Together, these findings suggest that completion of long walks,
without pausing, may be a better indicator of functional health
than daily step counts alone.
Our observation that fallers had reduced gait quality, measured by increased step-time variability confirms previous
findings of decreased step-to-step consistency [17], and reduced slope of the dominant acceleration frequency in elderly
fallers [18].
C. Comparisons With Clinical Studies and Bimodal Cadence
In agreement with previous clinical gait studies [5]–[7], we
found that slower and more variable gait were risk factors for

BRODIE et al.: EIGHT-WEEK REMOTE MONITORING USING A FREELY WORN DEVICE REVEALS UNSTABLE GAIT PATTERNS

falls. Complementary to clinical assessments, remote monitoring of walking patterns during ADL enabled measurement of
usual rather than optimum performance [8]. Building on previous remote monitoring [17]–[19], we quantified that exposure to
falling was caused by walks that ranged between 1 and 1000 s.
We also described statistical distributions for gait quantity, quality, and intensity, which may influence future analyses of remote
gait data.
The bimodal distribution for cadence (see Fig. 4) demonstrates that daily-life walking is different from clinical gait and
suggests that cadence is situation-dependent and includes at
least two preferred gait patterns in “healthy” walkers. Nonfallers
tended to walk at a higher cadence, exhibited greater bimodality,
and walked with increased vigor than fallers.
D. Confounding Factors and the Complexity of Falls
However, the trends for gait intensity were not significant
and confounded by one “active faller” (cadence 98 steps/min
and Ashman’s D 4.7) who consistently completed over 200
walks per day (see Fig. 1) and reported one fall. In panel C
of Fig. 5, this “active” faller’s profile (fifth from the bottom)
overlaps with some nonfallers’ performances (top 11 profiles),
highlighting the complexity of predicting falls.
Thus, complex nonlinear interactions between risk factors
was beyond the scope of this study such as exposure resulting
from high activity levels, which is a risk factor for outdoor but
not indoor falls [28], may have influenced fall outcomes. It is
also possible that the “active faller” may not have had both fast
and stable gait; combined factors required for low fall risk [10]
had greater propensity for reckless behavior [11] and was less
likely to use protective strategies [12].
The existence of an “active faller” highlights the complexity
of predicting falls and issues with using predefined fall counts
to group all fallers. In this study, if recurrent falls had been
used (two or more falls in 12 months) instead of single falls, the
one “active faller” would not have confounded the results, but
conversely, the gait profiles of some single fallers (and possibly
the profiles representing people most likely to respond to future
early intervention) would have been assigned to the nonfaller
group. Negative binomial regression would have removed the
need to define any group thresholds in the analysis [18], but
would not have provided statistical justification for the unique
clinical distinction we used to separate the profiles of “fallers”
from “nonfallers” (see Figs. 2–5).

2593

may also coincide with obstacle avoidance, turns, and/or load
carrying, which may cumulatively increase step-time variability for any particular walk. We observed that increased mode of
variability better identified fallers than mean of variability, possibly because the distributions for nonfallers were more skewed.
This suggests that nonfallers had both less variable gait under optimum ambulatory conditions and more exposure to cumulative
factors during daily-life walking, but without adverse outcomes.
F. Limitations
This is a method paper intended to provide a reference for
future population level tracking of changing gait impairments.
In agreement with our objective to: “identify statistical models
that describe how gait performances are distributed over several
weeks,” our most significant and novel findings were that walk
lengths, exposure, cadence, and variability over eight weeks
were not normally distributed, but followed power laws, bimodal
distributions, and log-normal distributions.
With respect to the observed differences between fallers and
nonfallers, we acknowledge several limitations. The sample size
was small, participants with a history of falling were all female,
shorter, and had more comorbidities. Furthermore, participants
had volunteered to be part of a home-based exercise program
and so may not be representative of all older independent living
people. It was not possible to obtain the same number of days
of sensor monitoring for all participants, because participants
forgot or chose not to wear the device some days, or because
the research prototype malfunctioned.
However, our objectives were not to identify fallers, but to
investigate how walking patterns are distributed during daily
life. This was achieved by analyzing an average of 58 days
walking from each participant. This study builds on previous
studies that have reported on data obtained for periods up to two
weeks. This paper further highlights why falls are a complex
multifactorial problem [9]–[11] and how tracking changing gait
impairment and exposure to falls during daily-life activities may
complement existing clinical assessments.
With respect to the default sample rate of 50 Hz, the waveletbased analysis algorithm registered impacts caused by heelstrikes occurring at a maximum of 3 Hz [8]. Therefore, significant memory and power savings might be possible by reducing
the sample rate, provided that a high sampling rate is not essential for detecting impacts caused by falling.
V. CONCLUSION

E. Log-Normal Distribution for Variability During ADL
Gait quality (as measured by step-time variability) was observed to follow a log-normal distribution (see Fig. 5). Lognormal distribution model systems are affected by multiple
cumulative factors, whereby each additional factor results in
an increase or “right-shift” to the parameter being studied. In
daily-life gait, the mode of step-time variability may, therefore,
describe gait under optimum ambulatory conditions. Previous
research has shown that many external factors negatively affect
gait quality, including uneven terrain [29], poor footwear [30],
dual tasks [31], and fatigue [32]. In daily-life gait, such factors

The use of a freely worn device and wavelet-based analysis
tools allowed long-term monitoring of daily-life walking patterns for walks greater than or equal to three steps. From a total
of 1085 days of data, we observed that short walks constitute a
large proportion of exposure to falls in older people. Compared
to nonfallers, fallers demonstrated significantly fewer steps per
walk, had relatively more exposure from short walks, had a
greater mode of variability, and were less able to complete long
walks without pausing. With respect to gait quality, mode of
variability may be a better measure of central tendency than
mean of variability to discriminate fallers from nonfallers.

Day-to-day, the number of walks performed varied considerably, but one week of monitoring appears sufficient to reliably
assess the long-term propensity for falling and inform future
interventions targeting fall injury reduction.
The statistical distributions of gait performances over eight
weeks provide new insight into the daily-life activities of older
people and may prove a useful reference for future wearable
device development and further research into the complex relationships between daily-life walking patterns, ageing, morbidity,
and falls risk.
