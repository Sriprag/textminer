Unsupervised Eye Blink Artifact Denoising of EEG
Data with Modified Multiscale Sample Entropy,
Kurtosis, and Wavelet-ICA
Ruhi Mahajan, Student Member, IEEE, and Bashir I. Morshed, Member, IEEE

Abstract—Brain activities commonly recorded using the electroencephalogram (EEG) are contaminated with ocular artifacts.
These activities can be suppressed using a robust independent
component analysis (ICA) tool, but its efficiency relies on manual intervention to accurately identify the independent artifactual components. In this paper, we present a new unsupervised,
robust, and computationally fast statistical algorithm that uses
modified multiscale sample entropy (mMSE) and Kurtosis to automatically identify the independent eye blink artifactual components, and subsequently denoise these components using biorthogonal wavelet decomposition. A 95% two-sided confidence interval
of the mean is used to determine the threshold for Kurtosis and
mMSE to identify the blink related components in the ICA decomposed data. The algorithm preserves the persistent neural activity
in the independent components and removes only the artifactual
activity. Results have shown improved performance in the reconstructed EEG signals using the proposed unsupervised algorithm
in terms of mutual information, correlation coefficient, and spectral coherence in comparison with conventional zeroing-ICA and
wavelet enhanced ICA artifact removal techniques. The algorithm
achieves an average sensitivity of 90% and an average specificity
of 98%, with average execution time for the datasets (N = 7)
of 0.06 s (SD = 0.021) compared to the conventional wICA requiring 0.1078 s (SD = 0.004). The proposed algorithm neither
requires manual identification for artifactual components nor additional electrooculographic channel. The algorithm was tested for
12 channels, but might be useful for dense EEG systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
EURONAL activities along the cortex can be recorded
noninvasively using scalp electroencephalogram (EEG).
EEG recordings can be related to certain mental states, audiovisual cues, attention, cognitive loads, and various disorders.
This is of recent interest to monitor patients in practical settings with complex neurological disorders including epilepsy,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and Alzheimer’s

disease. In the practical settings, EEG recordings are often affected by the extrinsic artifacts due to power line interferences
and intrinsic physiological artifacts due to ocular activities (eye
blink, saccades, and fixations), muscle activity, and cardiac activity. Power line interferences can be filtered by using high Q
notch filter. The subject may also be asked to avoid the excessive movements to reduce muscle related artifacts. However, it
is challenging for the subjects to avoid their ocular activities.
Specifically, eye blinks are the common biological phenomenon
with average blink duration between 100–400 milliseconds. It
is very crucial therefore to remove the blink related activities as
these high amplitude signals (can reach up to 800 μV) might
mislead the analysis [1]. One of the common practices to remove ocular artifacts is to use regression-based methods [2].
But, these methods need the recordings of the electrooculographic channel (EOG) [3]. It is also difficult to design an optimal regression model suitable for all types of artifacts. Another
conventional method to remove the eye blinks is using the linear filters with the cut-off frequency with respect to artifact
range [4]. However, the time-domain or frequency domain filtering can give substantial loss of the cerebral activity because
of spectral overlap between neurological and artifactual events
[5]. There is also consensus among researchers for using statistical techniques like independent component analysis (ICA)
[6], principal component analysis (PCA) [7], multiresolution
denoising [8]–[10], and wavelet with higher order statistics [11]
for artifact correction. Among these methods, ICA is perceived
to be a very robust method for ocular artifact removal, but its
procedure requires manually identifying the artifactual independent components. Though Kurtosis, data improbability, linear
trends, and spectral temporal maps [12] are proposed for component identification, most of these methods either need the
recording of an additional EOG signal for reference or expertise
intervention to mark the noisy components, hence making it a
time consuming and arduous process.
Higher order statistics such as modified multiscale sample
entropy (mMSE) along with Kurtosis to identify the eye blink
distributions in EEG has been mostly unexplored. This study
indicates that mMSE is a strong identifier of the blink related
artifactual components, and incorporation of Kurtosis further
strengthens the identification accuracy. Following up our previous study [13], this paper proposes an unsupervised fully automatic statistical threshold based eye blink artifact removal
method using mMSE and Kurtosis to identify the artifactual
blink components and multiresolution wavelet analysis to denoise these components. The algorithm thresholds only the

wavelet coefficients corresponding to the artifactual activity to
zero in the wavelet decomposition, retaining the neural activities persistent in the blink ICs intact, while suppressing the blink
activities. The following sections present this proposed method
with pilot data for comparative evaluation.
II. ICA, MMSE, AND KURTOSIS
This section describes the extended-infomax ICA decomposition method to obtain the statistically independent components
(IC) and the markers for recognizing the artifactual ICs.

predictable in comparison with neural activity. So, mMSE could
be a good statistical measure to recognize ocular activities.
In this paper, mMSE is implemented by first coarse graining
each IC for multiple scales and then computing the sample
entropy for each scale. As the EEG recordings used in this
study have 10 000 data points, we have used a fixed scale factor,
τ = 20, as the minimum length of the grained series, which
in this case will contain 500 data points is sufficient for the
information we seek. The coarse graining of each IC of the
EEG data is computed by averaging the successive data points
of the series in nonoverlapping window as

A. ICA for IC decomposition

(τ )

ICA is the widely accepted tool for decomposing the multivariate EEG data into its statistical independent, nonGaussian
components. The ICA models are applied for EEG analysis with
underlying plausible assumptions:
1) The cerebral and artifactual sources are linearly mixed
and are statistically independent.
2) The number of observed signals, S, are greater than or
equal to the number of ICs, u.
3) Propagation delays through the mixing medium (i.e.,
brain, scalp etc.) are negligible.
The linear ICA model for the observed EEG sources S is
expressed mathematically as
X =A×S

(1)

where X is the linear mixture of sources, A is the unknown
mixing matrix [14]–[16]. In this study, we have used extendedInfomax ICA algorithm to calculate the unmixing matrix, W so
that the components, u are as independent as possible and we
get the best approximation of S as
u = W × X ≈ S;

W = A−1 .

represents the coarse grained series, τ is scale factor, u

the original series [20]. The length of each coarse-grained series
is limited to N/τ .

The MSE for each grained series yj is then computed using

where maximum length of epochs for matching templates,
m = 2 and tolerance, r = 0.2 × SD; SD is the standard deviation of the data vectors. B and A are the counters to track
the m and (m + 1) template matches within the tolerance value
r, respectively. As the entropy for the blink related artifacts is
expected to be low, we can use the mMSE to detect the artifact
related components with low entropy values. The threshold for
the automatic identification algorithm to find the noisy components is explained in the Section III.

(2)

The extended-infomax ICA method, an extension of the Infomax decomposition [17] separates the sub-Gaussian and superGaussian distribution of the sources by minimizing the mutual
information between the components and maximizing their joint
entropy. The Infomax algorithm in this paper is implemented
using the runica function of the EEGLAB toolbox (MATLAB,
CA, US) with its default settings.
B. mMSE as an Artifact Marker
The concept of using entropy in terms of wavelet entropy,
Shannon’s entropy, Renyi’s entropy, and sample entropy has
been already found useful in identifying the artifact related ICs
[18]. Recently, it has been revealed by Bosl et al. that MSE
gives much more information about the regularity of the EEG
time-series than the aforementioned entropies of the single scale
[19]. Thus, this study explores the use of mMSE to identify eye
blinks in EEG recordings.
The intuition that mMSE can identify the artifact related components lies in the fact that the eye-blinks are concentrated in
the small temporal intervals with high probabilities and low entropy. In other words, the expected value of mMSE for the blink
related component is low because its pattern is more regular and

C. Kurtosis as an Artifact Marker
Kurtosis is the fourth-order cumulant to measure the peaked
distributions of the random variables and is mathematically
computed using the following equations:
k = m4 − 3m22
mn = E {(x − m1 )n }

(5)
(6)

where mn , m1 , and E are the nth order central moment of
the variable, mean, and the expectation function, respectively
[16]. In the practical settings of continuous EEG recordings,
the components with cardiac and eye blink activities have typically peak distributions with highly positive Kurtosis, whereas
noise induced by line currents and loose electrode connections
have flat distribution with negative Kurtosis [12]. So, measuring Kurtosis of the ICA decomposed EEG data, we can find
the components related to eye blink activities. In this paper,
an inbuilt MATLAB function kurtosis is used to compute the
Kurtosis for each IC.
III. PROPOSED UNSUPERVISED AUTOMATIC ALGORITHM

automatic algorithm to identify the artifacts, and the denoising

procedure to remove the artifact related components. The block
diagram of the proposed algorithm is given in Fig. 1.
A. Data Acquisition
A wireless 14-channel referential montage EPOC headset
(Emotiv, Eveleigh, NSW, Australia) is used to continuously
record the brain activities from the subjects at the sampling rate
of 128 sps. The headset has bandwidth of 0.2–45 Hz and digital
notch filters to ensure elimination of power line interferences.
Data is collected from four subjects (two males and two females)
based on the International 10–20 electrode locations at AF3,
AF4, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC5, FC6, P7, P8, T7, T8, O1, and O2. The
data acquisition has been conducted in an enclosed room with
dim light for 1 min 45 s. As per the protocol, at the beginning of
the recording session, the subject is asked to close the eyes for
30 s, then open the eyes and blink nine times with a 5-s hiatus. At
the end of the session, the subject is again instructed to close eyes
for 30 s. The experiment is repeated twice with all the subjects
except one subject, resulting in seven datasets to evaluate the
proposed blink artifact removal algorithm. The EEG recordings
from the subjects in this paper are labeled as Dataset X (where
X = 1 . . . 7). Because of poor recording quality in FC5 and
FC6 channels from Subject 1 (due to loose electrode contacts),
these channels were discarded. For uniform analysis, only the
best 12-channel recordings were selected from all datasets (discarded channels: Subject 2: T8, F4; Subject 3: F7, T7; and
Subject 4: P7, P8). Discarding poor recordings is not expected
to alter performance comparison.
B. Procedure for Identifying the Artifactual ICs
In the proposed algorithm, after ICA decomposition of the
EEG data, mMSE is computed for all the ICs. As blink artifacts
are notable outlier data representing the typical transient events,
they can be detected using thresholds after normalized distribution (Mean = 0 and Standard Deviation, SD = 1) of the data
[22]. In the current study, the sample size of the ICs (N = 12)
is small, so instead of classical threshold with 95% confidence
interval (CI) for normalized Z-distribution, we have used twosided 95% CI of the mean for Student’s t-distribution to detect
the blink artifact ICs. As explained previously, the expected
value of mMSE for the blink related artifactual IC is less in
comparison with neural activity related IC thus, the proposed
fully automatic algorithm uses the lower limit of the 95% CI
of the mean for thresholding the IC based on the mMSE. All
the ICs with their entropy values higher than the threshold are

expected to be belonging to the cerebral signal; while other ICs
are marked for wavelet correction. The lower limit of 95% CI
of the mean is calculated as
s
(7)
Lower limit = x̄ − √ × tN −1
N
where x̄ is the sample mean, s is the sample standard deviation,
and (N-1) is the degrees of freedom. At 95% significance level,
α = 0.05 and tn −1 = 2.201 for two-tailed test with 11 degrees
of freedom.
To enhance the efficacy of the algorithm, Kurtosis is also
used to determine eye blink activity distributions in the IC signal.
Kurtosis is zero for Gaussian distribution, positive for the peaked
activities (which mimics eye blink signal) and negative for the
flat distributions. So, in this study, the upper bound of the 95%
CI of the mean [calculated using (8)] is used as the threshold.
s
(8)
Upper limit = x̄ + √ × tN −1 .
N
All the ICs having Kurtosis higher than the upper limit of CI
are supposed to be blink artifacts and are marked for denoising.
The calculated statistics: mean, standard deviation (SD), and
standard error of the mean (SEM) for all the datasets with their
95% CI of the mean threshold are tabulated in Table I. Thresholds for the mMSE (0.890) and Kurtosis (29.76) for the Dataset
1 are marked with the dotted lines in the Fig. 2. All the components falling below the threshold for mMSE and above threshold
for Kurtosis are marked as eye blink artifact components and
are further processed for wavelet denoising. Similarly, on the
basis of the thresholds computed in the Table I, the components
selected for denoising are marked with the sign + in the Fig. 3.
Most of the blink artifact ICs are identified itself by the mMSE
but the fourth-order cumulant Kurtosis offers an additional advantage to the detection method by finding the super Gaussian
and subGaussian artifact distribution in the ICs.
C. Procedure for Denoising the Artifactual ICs
Once the artifactual ICs are identified, they are processed
for artifact suppression. It has been propounded by Castellanos
et al. [23] that the ICs with artifactual activities should not be
simply replaced with zero as they might have the leaked neural
signal in it and discarding the entire component will lead to
loss of meaningful data. So, in the proposed method, instead
of replacing the entire component with zero, we denoise only
the contaminated components with biorthogonal wavelets. It
differs from this conventional wavelet enhanced ICA (wICA)

on all the ICs. The components which are identified as artifacts
are only decomposed with wavelet transform which saves the
computation time and complexity. Discrete wavelet transform
(DWT), a fast, nonredundant transform performs better on the
already digitally sampled data (with finite duration) in contrast
with Continuous Wavelet Transform [24], [25], so in this study
multiresolution based DWT decomposition is employed. Occurrence of blink artifact in the IC is significantly detected at fourthlevel of decomposition with Biorthogonal mother wavelet bior

blink artifact IC.

The algorithm has been realized in MATLAB (MathWorks,

any manual visual inspection for the detection and suppression
of the artifacts.
IV. RESULTS
The 12-channel preprocessed EEG signals of the Dataset 1
for 78 s duration is plotted using MATLAB in Fig. 4. The
eye blinks can be conspicuously seen in the prefrontal cortex
region AF3, F7, F3, F4, F8, and AF4. This was also verified
with the spectral and temporal plots in EEGLAB software (not
included in the paper due to space constraint). After the ICA
decomposition of the data, 12 ICs are obtained as plotted in the
Fig. 5. The proposed algorithm is applied to all the ICs, then
using the markers: mMSE and Kurtosis, the eye blink related ICs
are identified and suppressed using the Wavelet transformation.
The blink artifact clean EEG data of the same dataset is plotted
in Fig. 6. It can be observed in Fig. 6 that the blink related
amplitude for frontal lobe electrode locations is significantly
attenuated in contrast to Fig. 4.
For comparison with the proposed technique, the ICs obtained
from the ICA decomposition are also visually classified as the
eye blink artifact ICs and other ICs based on their the scalp
map projection, component activity and the power spectrum
plots in EEGLAB. The spectral and temporal properties of the
components are evaluated as per the guidelines in EEGLAB
tutorial [31]. A comparison plot of the proposed method with
Zeroing- ICA method is shown in Fig. 7 for a section of EEG
data from Dataset 1 AF3 location. It is evident from the plot that
manual zeroing-ICA corrected data is deviated more from the

the algorithm and visual inspection check), False Positive (IC

The concordance between the automatic identification process and the visual identification process is found to be 95.2%.
The performance of the discussed method is also evaluated
using the statistical metrics—correlation coefficient and mutual
information over the conventional methods: zeroing ICA and
wICA. Correlation coefficient determines the correlation between the reconstructed artifact free EEG data and the raw EEG
data; more positive is the coefficient value, stronger is the correlation [33]. We have used an inbuilt MATLAB function corrcoef
to compute this parameter. As suggested in [34], we have also
calculated mutual information (a nonparametric measure of relevance between the two random variables) to find how much information artifact free EEG signal “a” shares with the raw EEG
signal “b”. Mathematically, it is found using Kullback–Leibler
divergence between the probability distribution functions as
 ∞ ∞
f (a, b)
dadb
(14)
f (a, b) log
MI =
f
(a)f (b)
∞
∞

where f(a, b) is the joint pdf and f(a) and f(b) are the
marginal pdfs. If the mutual information1 is larger, the resemblance of the reconstructed artifact free signal with the
raw signal is closer. The average respective values of correlation coefficient (0.7771/0.5767/0.5817) and mutual information (1.231/0.5750/0.4230) for all the datasets, enumerated in
Table III, demonstrate improved performance of the proposed
method over conventional methods. In addition to statistical
analysis, execution time of the proposed artifact removal technique is also compared with the standard wavelet ICA and is
plotted in Fig. 8. The figure depicts that denoising only required
artifact related components (as proposed in this study) significantly reduces mean execution time from 0.1078 s (SD = 0.004)
to 0.060 s (SD = 0.021) in contrast to the conventional wICA
technique. It is to be noted that the execution time for the
zeroing-ICA method depends upon the how quickly and accurately an expert mark the noisy ICs for denoising.
In order to further analyze over frequency domain, magnitude
squared spectral coherence measure between reconstructed artifact free data and the raw EEG data is computed (AF3 electrode
location of Dataset 1) for all three methods and is plotted in

where Pxy (f ) is the cross power spectral densities of signal,
Pxx (f ) is power spectral density of raw EEG signal, and Pyy (f )
is power spectral density of artifact-free EEG signal. Power
spectral densities are calculated over FFT length of 256 with
50% overlapped Hamming window using MATLAB mscohere
function. Fig. 9 shows that the coherence between signals is
strongest for frequencies above 10 Hz with the proposed method
in comparison to other methods.
V. DISCUSSION
We envision that wearable ambulatory EEG systems in future will be minimalistic and pervasive beyond clinical settings.
There is copious research on artifact removal in higher density EEG systems [1], [12], [18], [34]; the challenge still lies
when we have small number of channels. This study explores

a fully automatic and computationally fast algorithm to remove
eye-blink artifacts from an EEG system with few channels.
Extended-Infomax ICA decomposition employed in this
study is used for 12 channels, but is effective on large number of EEG channels as well [35], [36]. Eye blinks are typically
found to dominate 2–3 channels in high-dimension EEG data,
so we speculate that our method can be used for dense EEG systems; however, it needs to be experimentally tested. It should
be noted that for EEG systems, the quality of ICA relies on
preprocessing (e.g., dimensional reduction in dense EEG) and
sufficient number of time points used for decomposition [37].
For identification of eye blink artifact related ICs, we have
used two-pronged approach by using two conservative thresholds so as to minimize type I and type II error. The first threshold:
lower limit of 95% CI of mean for mMSE identify ICs on the
basis of data regularity, while the second threshold: upper limit
of 95% CI of mean for Kurtosis detect ICs on the basis of their
shape of probability distribution. For the given datasets, 95%
CI threshold limits were found to be the most robust limits in
order to identify blink ICs in comparison with 90% CI and 98%
CI limits. As a result, with the given thresholds, we expect least
type 1 and type II error. However, to account for peculiarities of
other artifacts (e.g., muscle movement, cardiac activities), the
algorithm can be modified to different threshold strategies.
This study employs mMSE for a typical artifactual activity,
i.e., eye-blink detection as it provides information regarding the
regularity of EEG data, however it might be useful for identifying rhythmic cardiac activities in EEG.
For wavelet decomposition, we also compared biorthogonal wavelet with fast, orthogonal Haar wavelet which
resulted in better overall reconstruction [correlation coefficient (0.8223/0.6573/0.6737) and mutual information
(1.609/0.7670/0.7910)]. However, biorthogonal wavelet has
shown much better reconstruction specifically over the blinking zone (see Fig. 7).
VI. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presents a new unsupervised, fast algorithm for
fully automatic identification and suppression of the eye blink
related ICs by using mMSE and Kurtosis as markers and wavelet
decomposition as denoising tool. mMSE fetches the regularity
information from the ICs over multiple temporal scales and can
efficiently identify the ICs with eye blink characteristics. Kurtosis enhances the performance by identifying the ICs with superGaussian ‘peaked’ probability distributions, which imitates the
eye blink distributions. Using lower and upper bounds of 95%
CI for the mean as threshold, the blink related artifactual ICs
identified (jointly by the markers) are then denoised using DWT
with Biorthogonal wavelet as the basis function. The statistical metrics: Sensitivity (90%), Specificity (98%) demonstrates
that the proposed method can denoise the eye blink artifacts effectively. The method offers the advantage of neither requiring
manual intervention for IC identification nor additional EOG
channel for reference. The results in terms of mutual information, correlation coefficient, and spectral coherence also show
better EEG signal reconstruction (with neural activity related

ICs intact) over the commonly used zeroing-ICA and wICA
methods. The algorithm discussed in this paper is intended for
eye blink correction, but can be applied to other ocular artifacts,
i.e., saccades and fixations and even cardiac artifacts with minor
modifications in thresholds. To confirm our hypothesis that our
method will work in higher dimensions, we need to apply our
method to a higher dimension EEG system.
