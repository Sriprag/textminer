Abstract—A new setup for exposure of human cells in vitro at
37 ◦ C to pulse-modulated 300 and 500 MHz signals of future magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems is designed, built up, and
characterized. Two dipole antennas, specifically designed for ultrahigh field MRI, are used as radiating structures. The electromagnetic (EM) field distribution inside the incubator containing
the cells is computed, and it is shown to be in a good agreement
with measurements. The electric field at the cell level is quantified numerically. Local, 1-g average, and averaged over the culture
medium volume SAR are provided along with the standard deviation values for each well. Temperature increments are measured
inside the culture medium during the exposure using an optical
fiber thermometer. Then, we identify the pulse parameters corresponding to the thermal threshold of 1 ◦ C, usually considered
as a threshold for thermally induced biological effects. For these
parameters, the induction of heat shock proteins is assessed to biologically verify a potential thermal response of cells. The data
demonstrate that, under the considered experimental conditions,
exposure to pulse-modulated radiations emulating typical ultrahigh field MRI signals, corresponding to temperature increments
below 1 ◦ C, does not trigger any heat shock response in human
brain cells.

biomedical diagnostics [1], [2], and new systems with improved
image resolution are now under development by several research centers worldwide. In particular, one of the world first
whole-body 11.7 T MRI scanners for preclinical imaging studies on humans is now under construction at NeuroSpin, Saclay,
France [3], [4]. In addition to the high-intensity magnetic field,
these emerging imaging systems operate with pulse-modulated
radiofrequency (RF) signals. The carrier frequency of the RF
signal, called Larmor frequency, equals 42.6 MHz/T for the
proton imaging. By increasing the magnetic field to 11.72 T,
the Larmor frequency reaches about 500 MHz. Moreover, peak
powers up to several kilowatts are expected to be used in practice. Such signal features allow overcoming the current limitations of existing MRI systems in terms of spatial resolution and
will open new opportunities for more accurate diagnostics [5].
However, biological and health impacts of MRI-generated
electromagnetic (EM) fields have been [6] and remain [7] an
important issue, in particular for emerging ultrahigh field systems. In 2004, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing
Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) made a summary of published
results and issued a statement [8], amended in 2009 [9], with the
aim to provide: 1) the information about the exposure levels and
possible health effects from magnetic and RF fields associated
with the use of MRI systems, and 2) precautions to be taken to
minimize health hazards and risks.
Several recent studies have addressed some aspects related
to the MRI safety. First, the interactions between static magnetic field of MRI and living systems have been investigated
numerically and experimentally [10]–[13]. A large-scale study
on subjective perception of discomfort during 7 T examinations has been recently performed [14]. The interference and
heating issues due to the presence of metallic electrodes and
implants during MRI examinations have been extensively studied [15]–[17]. The specific absorption rate (SAR) and heating
induced in the human body by the RF signals have been assessed
in detail for 1.5 and 7 T MRI [18]–[23]. It is worthwhile to note
that most of the studies have been focused on the macroscopic
physical and physiological aspects of the MRI safety so far, and
only very few have been carried out at the cellular level [5].
To the best of our knowledge, the biocompatibility issues
of high-peak-power pulse-modulated RF signals to be used in
11.7 T MRI scanners have never been investigated. Given the
increasing number of patients passing through the MRI exams,
these aspects must be carefully addressed before implementing new MRI systems into the clinical practice. Compared to

existing MRI devices operating at lower RF frequencies (see
Table I), at higher Larmor frequencies (i.e., 298 and 498 MHz),
the energy absorption in the tissues is more localized [25], [26].
In this study, we focus on the design and characterization,
from the EM and thermal viewpoints, of an experimental setup
developed to investigate potential biological effects of pulsemodulated 300 and 500 MHz signals with a peak power up to
several kilowatts. Such signals are expected to be used in future
MRI systems. Dipole antennas designed specifically for ultrahigh field MRI are used as radiating structures. In particular,
we define the exposure conditions for which the temperature
increment in the culture medium remains below 1 ◦ C and investigate (under these experimental conditions) whether such
signals could result in a heat shock response at the cellular
level.
Note that investigating the bioelectromagnetic issues related
to the high static magnetic fields of MRI is out of scope of this
study and should be considered separately.
The paper is organized as follows. The experimental setup
is described in Section II. Numerical and experimental EM
dosimetry data, as well as temperature measurement results,
are provided in Sections III and IV. Potential induction of a heat
shock response in cells exposed to pulse-modulated RF signals
is studied in Section V. Finally, the conclusions and perspectives
are discussed in Section VI.
II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
An ad hoc experimental setup has been built up for the exposure of human cells in culture to pulse-modulated RF radiations
(see Fig. 1). This setup consists of four main elements:
1) signal generation unit;
2) dipole antenna of ultrahigh field MRI;
3) thermostatic exposure chamber with biological samples;
and
4) temperature control unit (used only at 500 MHz, refer to
Section II-D).
Cell monolayers located in a tissue culture plate within the
temperature-controlled incubator are exposed by a dipole antenna to a pulse-modulated RF signal. The main subunits of this
setup are detailed hereafter.
A. Signal Generation Unit
The RF signal is generated at 300 or 500 MHz by a Rohde
& Schwarz SMB100 A generator (operating range: 9 kHz–

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the experimental setup (proportions are
not to scale).

1.1 GHz). The amplitude is modulated by square-wave pulses
using a Philips PM5786B pulse generator (repetition rate range:
1 Hz–125 MHz, pulse duration range: 2 ns–0.1 s). The pulse
duration considered in this study is 1 ms, and the duty cycle is 0.1%. These parameters are of the order of magnitude
of typical ultrahigh field MRI sequences [27]. The generated
low-power amplitude-modulated signal is then amplified by a
Bruker BLAH1000E 60-dB linear amplifier (operating range:
200 MHz–600 MHz). The peak output powers considered in
this study are 1 kW (at 500 MHz) and 1.7 kW (at 300 MHz)
(refer to Section IV).
B. Dipole Antennas
We used two shortened capacitor-terminated dipole antennas
matched at 300 MHz or 500 MHz (see Fig. 2). These dipoles
constitute Rx/Tx elements of an eight-channel transceiver array
designed for 7 T and 11.7 MRI scanners with the parallel transmission capability [28]. In particular, the 300 MHz dipole is
currently used in 7 T MRI systems at NeuroSpin for the human
brain imaging. The radiating element (260 × 30 × 2 mm3 ) is
placed above the ground plane of a buried balun circuit (370 ×
70 × 15 mm3 ).
At 300 and 500 MHz, standard dipoles measure 500 and
300 mm, respectively. To comply with the constraints related to
the dimension of the scanner, the antenna length is shortened
by loading both antenna extremities by a capacitor made of
a 3-mm-thick disc of ultra-pure alumina sandwiched between
two discs of copper. The radius of these capacitors, determined

by simulations, allows a rough tuning of the dipole to the desired frequencies: a 15 mm radius corresponds to 300 MHz,
and a 2 mm radius corresponds to 500 MHz. The principle of
this technique is explained in detail in [29]. This is the only
difference between the two dipoles.
As in practice MRI antennas can be mismatched due to the
presence of the human body, a tuning/matching LC circuit made
of two adjustable capacitors in parallel (1–10 pF) connected by
an inductance (22 nH) is placed between the SubMiniature version A (SMA) port and balun input to tune precisely the antennas
in presence of a load (e.g., human head). This fine tuning circuit allows in practice obtaining the reflection coefficient S11
below –15 dB. The reflection coefficients simulated at 300 and
500 MHz equal –11.6 and –12.3 dB, respectively. Note that the
fine tuning circuit is not modeled in simulations because it has
only negligible effect on the radiated fields.
The antenna efficiencies simulated in free space on a semiinfinite ground plane equal 39% and 76% at 300 and 500 MHz,
respectively. It is very challenging to validate these values by
direct measurements. Therefore, a specific calibration procedure
allowing to account for possible underestimated losses has been
performed, as explained in Section III.
C. Exposure Chamber and Biological Samples
The antenna and biological samples are located in a thermostatic incubator Memmert 400 (see Fig. 3) whose internal
dimensions are 400 (w) × 400 (h) × 330 (d) mm3 . The inner
walls of the incubator are made of stainless steel. A metallic
plate, made of the same material, with 36 holes of 8 mm in
diameter, is placed at a distance of 10 cm from the top of the
incubator (see Fig. 1) in order to reduce the total volume of the
exposure chamber. This allows shifting the minimal resonance
frequency of the incubator (588 MHz for the incubator with the
metallic plate inside) above the operating frequency of the dipole
(300 and 500 MHz) and reduces the computational volume in
the modeling. This plate is also used for the thermoregulation
as explained in Section II-D.
The tissue culture plate containing the human cells is placed
at 3 cm above the dipole (see Fig. 1). This represents a typical
distance between the RF antenna and the head of a patient in
a RF coil of an ultrahigh field MRI. The cell monolayers are

located at the bottom of the six-well tissue culture plate made
of polystyrene (BD Bioscience, Le Pont De Claix, France). The
human astrocytoma cell line (U-251 MG) used in this study,
as well as the culture medium (8.5 mL per well) and tissue
culture plate have been described previously in detail [30], [31].
A holder made of polyvinyl chloride is fabricated to maintain
the tissue culture plate and optical fibers during temperature
measurements.
D. Thermoregulation of the Incubator
At 300 MHz, thermoregulation is ensured by the incubator itself, and the temperature is regulated at 37 ◦ C. At 500 MHz,
the functioning of the incubator is disrupted by the highpower pulse-modulated signals. Therefore, for the experiments
at 500 MHz, we implemented an autonomous heating system
based on a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller for
the thermoregulation inside the incubator. This enables: 1) to
control precisely the temperature inside the exposure chamber
(the resulting precision of the temperature control is ±0.05 ◦ C)
and 2) to avoid the EM compatibility problems related to the
perturbation of the incubator electronics by the RF pulses.
To this end, six 70 W resistors connected in series to a
dc power supply (Convergie SDL/G1 HR6018) are used for
heating. The power delivered by the power supply is automatically adjusted through the PID controller (implemented in LabView) as a function of the temperature measured close to the
cell layer. The temperature is monitored using a FISO EVOLUTION optical fiber thermometer with FOT-L probe (FISO,
Quebec, Canada) with ±0.25 ◦ C accuracy (see Fig. 1). The tip
of the optical fiber is placed in a cylindrical holder made of
plexiglas and located just above the tissue culture plate. The use
of optical fiber thermometers ensures minimum perturbation of
the RF field inside the incubator.
III. ELECTROMAGNETIC DOSIMETRY
Due to the small dimensions of the wells of the tissue culture plates, it is not possible in practice to measure the EM
field directly in the cell monolayers. Therefore, we adopted

the following strategy to quantify the EM field. First, the incubator interior containing the antenna and samples was simulated numerically to obtain the field distribution in the incubator
(see Section III-A). Then, the magnetic field inside the incubator was measured and compared to the numerical data (see
Section III-B). Finally, the EM field and SAR distributions
inside the tissue culture plate are deduced and analyzed (see
Section III-C).
A. Computation of the EM Field Inside the Incubator
The relative distribution of the EM field inside the incubator
is computed using High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS,
Ansys Inc., Canonsburg, PA, USA) software based on the finite element method. The full-wave approach implemented in
HFSS in combination with a nonuniform adaptive tetrahedral
mesh is well adapted for solving complex EM problems. The
computer-aided design (CAD) model is represented in Fig. 4.
The total computational volume contains 550 000 tetrahedrons,
corresponding to about 38 GB of RAM memory.
The dielectric properties of the materials used in the simulations are summarized in Table II. For most of the materials, their
properties are extracted from the HFSS materials database. The

dielectric properties of the culture medium at 300 and 500 MHz
are measured using an Agilent 85070C 200 MHz–20 GHz coaxial dielectric probe at 37 ◦ C. The mass density of the culture
medium equals 1.16 g/cm3 .
The magnetic field distributions at z = 12.5 cm (the coordinate system is indicated in Fig. 1) is shown in Fig. 5 at 300
and 500 MHz. This height corresponds to one of the planes in
which the measurements have been carried out (numerical data
are compared to the measured H-field values in Section III-B).
These distributions remain the same for variations of ±5%
around the central frequency.
B. Measurements of EM Field Inside the Incubator
As in practice it is not possible to measure the field directly
at the location of cell monolayers (3 cm above the antenna), the
magnetic field has been measured in two horizontal planes at z =
9 cm and z = 12.5 cm using H3DV7 isotropic H-field probes
operated by an EASY4 system (SPEAG, Switzerland). Each
probe contains three concentric loop sensors of 3.8 mm in diameter. The accuracy of the probe announced by the manufacturer

is of ±6.0%. Twelve measurements per plane have been performed corresponding to all possible (x, y) combinations of the
following coordinates: x [mm] = (−105, −35, 35, 105) and y
[mm] = (0, −35, −70). For these measurements, the door of the
incubator is replaced by a 1-cm-thick dielectric plate, covered
by the 0.04-mm-thick adhesive copper tape. Six holes in the
plate allow positioning the H-field probes inside the incubator.
All measurements were performed in presence of the tissue culture plate containing the cells and culture medium positioned as
explained in Section II-C and illustrated in Figs. 1, 3, and 4. In
measurements, the antenna input power was 1 W, and the fine
tuning LC circuit is tuned to reach a reflection coefficient below
−15 dB.
Fig. 6 presents the comparison between numerical and experimental results at 300 MHz normalized to 1 kW antenna input
power for the z = 12.5 cm plane (for the sake of brevity, the data
at 500 MHz are not presented). The magnitude of the magnetic
field is overestimated in simulations, and therefore, a correction
coefficient is applied to the numerical data presented in Fig. 6 to
fit them to the experimental results. This difference can be explained by an underestimation of losses in the numerical model
due to: 1) the uncertainty in the values of the dielectric and
metallic losses; 2) relatively high losses in the epoxy glue (not
modeled in simulations) used to fix the capacitances to the radiating element from the top side and to the ground plane from the
bottom [see Fig. 2(a)]; and 3) radiated field due to the leakage,
which is not taken into account in simulations as the incubator
is considered to be ideally shielded. The correction coefficients
are: Hm easured = 0.57 Hsimulated (at 300 MHz); Hm easured =
0.75 Hsimulated (at 500 MHz). Application of these coefficients
leads to a very satisfactory agreement (the average and maximum relative deviations are of 5.4% and 15.8%, respectively)
between computed and measured H field distributions both at
300 and 500 MHz.
The larger diameter of the capacitances at 300 MHz (see
Section II-B) resulting in more losses in the epoxy glue partly
explains stronger correction at this frequency compared to
500 MHz. For the sake of brevity, the data for z = 9 cm are
not shown; they lead to the same correction coefficients within
the measurement accuracy.

Fig. 7. Peak E field distributions at the bottom of the culture medium for an
antenna input power of 1 kW. 1 and 2 correspond to two positions of the optical
fiber probes for the temperature measurements.

These coefficients are applied to all results provided hereafter
for the E field, H field, and SAR.
C. EM Field and SAR Inside the Culture Medium
Finally, the electric field is computed in the culture medium as
described in Section III-A. Because of its very small thickness
(typically 5–15 μm), the presence of the cell monolayer does
not change the EM field and temperature distribution within a
well. Therefore, it is not included in the numerical model.
Surface distributions of the E field and SAR at the bottom
of the culture medium (z = 6.5 cm) are represented in Figs. 7
and 8(a) and (b), respectively. They are quite similar at 300
and 500 MHz. However, the E field and SAR values are higher
at 500 MHz because of the higher radiation efficiency of the
500 MHz dipole (see Sections II-B and III-B), difference in
the near-field distributions at 300 and 500 MHz, and slightly
higher power transmission to the culture medium at 500 MHz
explained by the power transmission coefficient that increases
with frequency (see Table I) [32]. Fig. 8(c) and (d) shows SAR
in vertical cutting planes in each well providing a deeper insight
into the SAR distribution in the culture medium volume.
The local peak, 1-g average, and averaged over the culture
medium volume SAR, as well as standard deviation for each
well, are summarized in Table III for an antenna input power of
1 kW. Note that the culture medium mass per well is close to
10 g, and therefore, the SAR averaged over the culture medium

as those in wells 3 and 6. This is explained by the fact that
the tissue culture plate is slightly shifted from the center of the
dipole along x axis.
IV. THERMAL DOSIMETRY
Here, we define the exposure parameters for which the maximum temperature increase in the cells and culture medium does
not exceed 1 ◦ C for 45 min of exposure. This temperature increment is usually considered as a threshold for thermally induced
biological effects [33]. The exposure duration is chosen as a
typical duration of a MRI examination.

volume almost coincides with 10-g average SAR. These data
are consistent with the data for the power budget presented in
Table IV, demonstrating that the total power absorbed in the
culture medium is higher at 500 MHz compared to 300 MHz.
As can be seen in Figs. 7 and 8(a) and (b), the E field and
SAR values in wells 1, 2, 4, and 5 are almost identical, as well

We use a REFLEX-4 optical fiber thermometer with a T1 S-5
probe (NEOPTIX, Canada) to monitor the temperature at different locations inside the culture medium at 1 mm from the bottom
of the well. In contrast to the FISO system (see Section II-D),
this thermometer allows measuring the temperature very locally
(in a region of 0.4 mm in diameter). The temperature stability inside the culture medium is verified before each exposure
during 3–5 h and remains within ±0.06 ◦ C.
We consider here square-wave pulses whose characteristics
are provided in Section II-A and vary the RF power to reach 1 ◦ C
increment after 45 min of exposure. The temperature dynamics
for a peak power of 1.7 kW is plotted in Fig. 9 for 2 h of exposure
demonstrating 0.9–1 ◦ C and 1.4–1.5 ◦ C temperature increases
after 45 min and 2 h of exposure, respectively. The steady state
is reached after approximately 3 h 30 min of exposure.
B. Temperature Measurements at 500 MHz
At 500 MHz, the peak input power is decreased to 1 kW
to obtain 1 ◦ C temperature increment after 45 min of exposure. The fact that the similar temperature rises are observed for

different SAR could be explained by: 1) different thermoregulation systems at 300 and 500 MHz (see Section II-D) and 2)
different SAR distributions within the culture medium at 300
and 500 MHz leading to the difference in convection and, therefore, to the different temperature exchange rates between the
culture medium and surrounding plastic/air.
The measured temperature dynamics for positions 1 and 2
[indicated in Fig. 7(b)] are shown in Fig. 10. While the temperature increment is slightly higher at location corresponding to the
higher SAR (position 1), the temperature difference is relatively
small. It is of the same order as the measurement reproducibility
(±0.15 ◦ C). This may be explained by the thermal conductivity
and convection currents that significantly reduce temperature
gradients in the culture medium.
Table V summarizes the characteristics of pulses corresponding to the 1 ◦ C thresholds. They are used for the cells exposure
experiments described in Section V.

V. BIOLOGICAL RESULTS OF CELL CULTURE EXPOSURE
We investigate here the induction of heat shock proteins
(HSP) after exposure to pulse-modulated RF signals to biologically evaluate a potential thermal response of cells under
exposure conditions selected in Section IV.
HSP are cytoprotective factors that play an important role in
many cellular functions. Induction of HSP synthesis is often
associated with cellular responses to stressful conditions. These
proteins are therefore relevant biomarkers to monitor the impact
of environmental factors on cells or organisms. In particular,
expression of the endogenous HSP70 is the most commonly
used test for monitoring heat shock response and other cellular
stress [34].
A. Exposure at 300 MHz
U-251 MG glial cell line was sham-exposed or exposed to
the pulse-modulated radiation for 45 min (exposure parameters
are provided in Table V). As gene expression is a multiple- step
process, we analyzed HSP70 induction at different levels. The
experimental procedures have been described in detail elsewhere
[30], [35].
First, using a luciferase reporter gene (pHSE-TATA-Luc), we
investigated potential activation of heat shock transcription factors and gene promoter activity [see Fig. 11(a)]. Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),
we verified whether exposure could alter RNA accumulation

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

exposure experiments.

[see Fig. 11(b)]. Then, we performed a Western blot assay to
determine HSP70 protein concentration in order to assess the
impact on translation and protein stability [see Fig. 11(c)]. These
results demonstrate that the exposure has no significant effect
compared to sham-exposed samples.
For each assay, systematic positive controls were performed
to verify the sensitivity of our experimental procedures. Depending on the applied test (transfection, RT-PCR, or Western blot),
a heat shock control (41 ◦ C, 45 min) induced HSP70 overexpression by a factor 6 to 60 (data not shown). This directly rules
out the possibility that absence of positive data after exposure
can be due to some technical problems.

B. Exposure at 500 MHz
In contrast to exposure at 300 MHz, we used here only
RT-PCR for monitoring potential cellular stress after exposure
to pulse-modulated radiation at 500 MHz (exposure parameters are summarized in Table V) since it is the most sensitive
method. Moreover, we have measured the expression of a set of
HSP genes using a PCR array kit (human stress & toxicity pathway finder, SABiosciences, QIAGEN, Courtaboeuf, France),
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. These HSP
genes have been reported in literature to respond to many cellular stresses at the transcriptional level. PCRs were normalized
using a set of five housekeeping genes (ACTb, B2M, GAPDH,
HPRT-1, RPL3 a) as internal control. The results were analyzed with the dedicated software Opticon Monitor 3 (Bio-Rad,
Marnes-la-Coquette, France).
In parallel, a positive control was run. Cells were treated
overnight with MG132 (1 μM), a drug known to trigger proteotoxic stress. Depending on the HSP gene, this treatment induces their expression by a factor 3 to 100 (data not shown).
This control validates the utilization of this PCR array kit for
monitoring the level of cellular stress after exposure.
The experimental data (see Fig. 12) demonstrate the absence
of significant modifications in gene transcription and mRNA
concentration after 45 min of exposure to pulse-modulated radiation. Furthermore, no changes were also observed for 2 h of
exposure.

In this study, we built up an exposure system to assess in vitro
the biocompatibility of pulse-modulated RF signal of future
ultrahigh field MRI scanners. The system is designed using two
dipole antennas, matched at 300 or 500 MHz, to be used in 7
and 11.7 T MRI, respectively.
The magnetic field distributions are computed and measured
in several horizontal planes inside the incubator. Numerical results, normalized using a correction coefficient accounting for
the underestimated losses, are in a good agreement with measurements. The electric field at the cell level is quantified numerically. Local, 1-g average, and averaged over the culture
medium volume SAR are provided along with the standard deviation values for each well.
The use of dipole antennas designed for the ultrahigh field
MRI results in a certain level of nonuniformity of the EM field
distributions at the cellular level, which should be taken into
account when interpreting the biological results obtained using
this system. In particular, the ratio of the standard deviation to
the average SAR is equal to 62% and 66% at 300 and 500 MHz,
respectively. It is worthwhile to note that the nonuniformity
of SAR in MRI is typically of the same order or can be even
higher [36], [37]. The uniformity can be improved by designing,
optimizing, and implementing a specific radiating stricture for
the presented setup. This optimization problem is out of the
scope of this study, but constitutes one of its perspectives.
The temperature dynamics have been locally measured inside
the culture medium at several locations. Based on these results,
the exposure parameters have been chosen so as they do not induce a temperature increase in the culture medium higher than
1 ◦ C for 45 min of exposure. It was demonstrated that the temperature dynamics changes only slightly at different locations
within a well (the difference is of the order of the measurement
reproducibility equal to ±0.15 ◦ C) mainly because of the convection and thermal conductivity. It is worthwhile to note that
the peak electric field of pulse-modulated radiations considered
here are one-two orders of magnitude below compared to that
of electric pulses used for the electroporation [38].
For the selected exposure parameters, we have examined in
vitro potential modifications of HSP gene expression to investigate possible thermal effects at the cellular level. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate that pulsed-modulated radiations
at 300 and 500 MHz, corresponding to temperature increments
slightly below 1 ◦ C, do not trigger any heat shock response in
human brain cells. As EM pulses can also lead to biological consequences without any significant heating [39], additional stress
markers are now analyzed to complete biological results of this
study; they will be reported in a separate paper. In particular,
further immunofluorescence analysis (data not shown) confirms
that, under the considered exposure conditions, the nonuniformity of exposure does not lead to any local effects at the cellular
level.
