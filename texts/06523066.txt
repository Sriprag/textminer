Abstract—Prognosis and diagnosis of cardiac diseases frequently
require quantitative evaluation of the ventricle volume, mass, and
ejection fraction. The delineation of the myocardial wall is involved
in all of these evaluations, which is a challenging task due to large
variations in myocardial shapes and image quality. In this paper, we
present an automatic method for extracting the myocardial wall of
the left and right ventricles from cardiac CT images. In the method,
the left and right ventricles are located sequentially, in which each
ventricle is detected by first identifying the endocardium and then
segmenting the epicardium. To this end, the endocardium is localized by utilizing its geometric features obtained on-line from a
CT image. After that, a variational region-growing model is employed to extract the epicardium of the ventricles. In particular,
the location of the endocardium of the left ventricle is determined
via using an active contour model on the blood-pool surface. To
localize the right ventricle, the active contour model is applied on
a heart surface extracted based on the left ventricle segmentation
result. The robustness and accuracy of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by experimental results from 33 human and 12 pig
CT images.

I. INTRODUCTION
ELINEATING the myocardial wall of the left (LV) and
right (RV) ventricles is an important step in the prognosis and diagnosis of cardiac diseases. This topic has been
investigated for decades [1], and it is still an active research
field [2]–[4]. The main challenges include wide shape variability between different cardiac cycles and between different
patients, weak edges between epicardium and heart fat or soft
tissues, and thin thickness of the RV wall.
Model-based methods have become dominant in this research [1] to get an accurate and robust segmentation. Typically,
a heart model is built by learning the geometric or intensity features of the heart from cardiac images. While in segmentation, a
commonly used framework is first globally aligning the model
to an image and then deforming this model to fit image content.
Global localization is achieved by detecting the geometric or intensity features of the heart. Local deformations are performed
by optimizing an objective function defined between the model
parameters and image features. In particular, the model-based
methods can be roughly categorized based on whether these
models are applied explicitly or implicitly for segmentation. In
the first type of methods, typically a heart surface model is fitted
to images for segmentation. For example, in active shape models (ASMs) [5], [6], a statistical shape model called the point
distribution model is learned from a set of aligned shapes using the principal component analysis (PCA) technique, which is
then iteratively aligned to image boundaries. Active appearance
models (AAMs) extend this idea by incorporating gray level
information [7] and were used in segmenting the left and right
ventricles from MR images [8]. The deformations allowed in
the parametric models such as ASMs and AAMs are restricted
to the shape space where the heart models are embedded. A
more sophisticated way of representing the shape space is by
using 3-D diffusion wavelets [9], which encode shape variations
hierarchically. Using deformable models, the authors in [10]
and [11] provided a way to incorporate shape priors that allows
adaptivity for local variations. In these methods, an annotated
heart surface model is deformed to match image content by optimizing affine or similarity transformations defined between the
model parameters and image features. In particular, landmark

points on the interventricular septum were used to guide the
segmentation in [11]. Instead of deforming a prealigned model,
atlas-based methods use shape information implicitly by directly
registering atlas image to a target image. Then, either the labels
from multiple atlases are fused [12] or registered atlases are
deformed [13] to extract the heart chambers. However, the segmentation of the myocardial wall of the RV has been neglected
in these state-of-the-art model-based methods [10], [11], [13].
Model-free methods are also widely used to explore the characteristics of heart geometry or intensity distribution from other
perspectives. For example, the random forests method was used
to model the geometric and intensity features in the myocardial
region for delineating the myocardium [14]. For a comprehensive literature review of heart segmentation, see [1] and [2] and
references therein.
How to localize the model initially is a less studied topic,
especially for these methods using deformable models, which
tend to get stuck in undesirable local extrema when started
without a good initialization. Typically, the geometric features
of the heart are used for localization. For example, in [15],
the LV endocardium was initialized by searching for a circular
structure in a blood pool mask obtained via thresholding. A
similar empirical rule was used in identifying the left ventricle
cavity [16]. Examples of more advanced localization methods
include the generalized Hough transform [10] and optimization
of similarity transformation for a heart model [11]. Atlas-based
registration has also been used for coarse initialization [9], [13].
One observation that may be utilized for the localization is
that the ventricles are salient components on the heart surface.
This is where the shape decomposition/segmentation technique
can be utilized to cluster the surface into meaningful components
based on some given criteria as in computer graphics and geometric modeling [17], [18]. For example, a surface may be hierarchically decomposed into regions of deep concavities by using
fuzzy clustering and graph partition techniques [19]. Applications of shape segmentation in medical imaging can be found in
heart modeling from images [20] and aneurysm neck detection
on vessel surfaces [21]. Active contour models have also been
applied on surfaces to refine coarse segmentations [22] or extract objects of interest [23]. The Shape segmentation technique
would be a powerful tool for ventricle localization because ventricles are prominent components on the heart surface. Among
the few applications of this technique in cardiac image segmentation, the narrowing of vessels around the left atrium was
detected by merging local features based on given criteria to
extract the left atrium [24].
In this paper, we propose a method for automatically extracting the myocardial wall from cardiac CT images, which
integrates region growing with shape segmentation in a natural
way. In this framework, the shape segmentation provides seed
regions for region growing while the latter reconstructs a heart
surface for the shape segmentation. Specifically, the segmentation process starts by localizing the LV endocardium. Unlike the
localization methods described so far, our method is based on
the observation that the LV is a salient component on the blood
pool surface, which can be identified on the surface by utilizing
shape segmentation techniques. After that, a variational region-

growing method [25], driven by the robust statistics of a seed
region around the endocardium is applied to localize the epicardium. Once the LV is determined, the RV is localized based
on the segmentation of the LV. The RV epicardium is initialized
in the same way as in localizing the LV epicardium. Finally,
these myocardial surfaces are refined by employing an active
contour model using the initial segmentations as a constraint.
The contributions of the proposed method are as follows:
1) we present an automatic localization method for both ventricles with high accuracy. Unlike other methods that only
use low level information from voxels, our method captures a global geometric characteristic of the ventricles.
Hence, it is not sensitive to such issues as variability in
ventricle shapes and volume coverages. Note that, as an
initialization step, this localization method can be easily
incorporated into other model-based frameworks.
2) The proposed method is able to segment thin-layer structures like the myocardium of the RV, which has been
neglected by some of these latest methods [10], [11], [13].
3) The overall system is complete in that all the active contour
models involved are initialized automatically and robustly,
other than in those systems where active contours are either used as a single component or initialized manually.
In addition, no training image is required in our method,
which works in the cases where the number of images
available is limited.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we describe the details of the overall framework, including the
localization of the ventricles and wall structure extraction. In
Section III, we provide some experimental results to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method. Finally, in Section IV, we draw some conclusions and outline
some future research directions.
II. PROPOSED METHOD
The flowchart of the proposed method is shown in Fig. 1. The
overall segmentation process consists of ventricle localization
and myocardial wall extraction. First, the LV is localized by using shape segmentation techniques. Then, the RV is identified on
a heart surface constructed based on the segmentation of the LV.
Finally, the myocardial wall, lying between the epicardial and
endocardial surfaces of the ventricles, is refined by employing
an active contour model with a constraint based on the localization results. The main steps are described in the following
sections.
A. Localize the LV
Assume that the orientation of a CT image is given and there
is sufficient contrast between blood pool and myocardium. The
localization of the LV is determined via searching for a deep
concave boundary on the blood pool surface as follows.
1) Extract Blood Pool Surface: Since CT images have calibrated gray levels, the source image is thresholded to highlight
the blood pool region. Then, a morphological opening operator
is applied to remove noisy arteries and cut spines that may be
residing in the same connected component of the heart. The

largest connected component is chosen and triangulated as the
blood pool surface.
2) Detect Apex Point: Suppose the coordinate system of the
source image is left–posterior–inferior (LPI) as shown in Fig. 2.
The anatomy of the pig heart is almost identical to human’s
but with a different long-axis orientation [26]. As shown in
the figure, the long axis of the human heart is pointing toward
the anterior plane, while the pig’s is tilted in the inferior direction. Thus, to narrow down the search space, the left-most
point in a predefined region of interest (ROI) is first determined.
Then, a neighborhood of this point is explored so that it is large
enough to cover the apex point. After that, the most anterior
and inferior points within the neighborhood N (plv ) are selected
as the human and pig apex points, respectively. See Fig. 3. A
human data point will be used to demonstrate the rest of the
steps.
3) Find an Initial Cut Contour: An initial cut contour, de0
, can be found by analyzing the distance field
noted by Clv
starting from the apex point. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the
lengths of isocontours on the distance field increase gradually,
and then drop slightly. After a certain point, they are growing
rapidly followed by sharp reductions. An explanation of this
pattern is that the LV has an overall ellipsoid-like shape, which
is concave around the base area. Thus, the total length of an

example of papillary muscle removal is shown in Fig. 6.

by choosing voxels within a certain distance range to the I˜endo

uniform thickness. Here, another way is proposed to initialize

I˜epi
by utilizing a variational region-growing method that is
driven by the robust statistics of image intensities. Similar to
lv

dilation-based methods, a distance field from I˜endo
and a small strip region lying between din and dout is chosen as
the seed region for the epicardium mask. Typically, the values are
set to din = 2 mm and dout = 4 mm. The blood pool voxels are
excluded from this region. Once the seed region is determined,
the robust-statistics-based energy functional [25] is then defined
as

where δ(U ) is the Dirac delta function. The energy E(U ) evaluates a weighted contour length. Gradient descent technique is
employed to solve (4). See the Appendix for details.
To reduce the effect of local noise, the contour evolution
process described previously may be applied twice. In the first
round, set g = 1 so that it shortens the initial contour by the
geodesic curvature flow. Then, the feature function defined in
(3) is utilized to refine the contour so that it stops at expected
locations. An illustration of the LV localization process is shown
in Fig. 5.

x ∈ Ω. This probability function p(f (x)) can be learned from
the intensities inside the seed region via kernel regression. The
first term in this equation measures the intensity homogeneity
inside the contour, and the second term is the length of the contour that controls the smoothness of the final result. In practice,

B. Localize the RV
The same strategy is used to localize the RV as follows.
1) Reconstruct the Heart Surface: The intensity inside the
RV blood pool may not be as homogeneous as the LV. To identify
the RV, a smooth heart surface is first reconstructed by taking

the LV endocardium as a seed region to start the variational
region-growing process defined in (5). In implementation, the
parameter λRS was set as λRS = 0.9 so that the intensity homogeneity force term plays a leading role while competing with
the smoothing force to explore the entire heart region. The surface is represented as a triangulated surface, denoted by Mht .
An example of the region-growing process is shown in Fig. 7.
Since the blood pool occupies the majority of the LV endocardial
mask, the growing process shows a higher tendency to expand
brighter regions than the darker ones. Combining the effect of
the smoothing term, the growing process gradually captures a
smooth heart region.
2) Find an Initial Cut Contour: The closest point from Mht
to the LV apex papx is used as a starting point to reconstruct the
distance field on Mht . Then, the distance field is sampled evenly
at an interval of 2 mm. Let {p̃i }, i = 1 · · · m, be the points of
a given isocontour C. The distance between the isocontour and
the cut contour Clv of Mbp is approximated by

where Nlv and pc are the unit normal of the best fitting plane
and centroid of Clv , respectively. Then, the isocontour with the
minimal distance to Clv is selected as the initial contour that
identifies the ventricles on Mht .

3) Segment the RV Endocardium: The initial cut contour Cvs
is refined by using the geometric active contour model described
in Section II-A4. The surface determined by Cvs includes both
the LV and RV, which is rasterized to get a mask for the ventricles, denoted by I˜vs . The RV endocardium mask is obtained by
removing the LV and blood pool voxels from I˜vs . Fig. 8 shows
the process of segmenting the RV endocardium.

C. Extract the Myocardial Wall
To extract the myocardial wall, the mask images of the ventricles are refined by employing an active contour method with
a shape constraint that allows local variations around the segmented masks. After that, the outlier voxels are excluded to get
a complete wall structure.

Here, dm in and dm ax control the range of the signed distance,

set α = 1, β = 5, dm in = 0.02 mm and dm ax = 1.0 mm. The
first term in (7) is a localized region-based energy [29]. In this
study, the Chan–Vese energy [30] is used for F (I(y), φ(y)). The
second term is essentially the geometric active contour energy
[27], [28] using the feature image g̃ to allow local deformations
around the initial contour.
2) Extract the Myocardial Wall: The myocardial wall is defined as the volume between the endocardium and epicardium
masks. The majority of the wall can be determined by performing the logic XOR operation between the endocardium and
epicardium masks of the LV and RV, respectively. Note that

the contour evolution process returns closed surfaces. Thus, the
voxels inside the blood pool are excluded to extract a complete
myocardial wall. An example of extracting the myocardial wall
is given in Fig. 9.
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.
We tested the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method
using 33 human and 12 pig cardiac CT images. The data include
anomaly cases (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aneurysm)
and volumes with different scanning quality.
A. Implementation
The overall framework was implemented in C++. Open
source packages ITK [31] and VTK [32] were used for basic
image processing tasks and 3-D visualization, respectively.
In extracting the blood pool, the source image was downsampled to a voxel resolution of 2.0 mm × 2.0 mm × 2.0 mm.
The shape of the LV is well preserved at this resolution. The
thresholds of 180 and 350 in Hounsfield units were used for the
human and pig datasets, respectively, so that the ventricles can
be separated after thresholding.
In detecting the apex point, the ROI for the human data was set
as a rectangular box located at the left–anterior–inferior corner,
which is one-eighth of the size of its corresponding bounding
box of Mbp . The ROI for the pig data was defined similarly but
centered in the left-to-right direction. The neighborhood size
N (plv ) is controlled by a threshold, which was empirically set
as 50 mm.
To find the isocontour length model, the distance field was
sampled evenly at an interval of 2 mm. In refining the cut contour, the size of the narrow band is controlled by a threshold
φm ax , which is typically set as φm ax = min(10, 4lm ax ) mm,
where lm ax is the length of the longest edge on Mbp . The time
step dt = 1 was used in implementation.
To remove the papillary muscles, the structure element size
depends on that of the papillary muscles, which was empirically set as 3 mm. To extract the LV epicardium, a parameter
dw is used to control the maximum distance allowed in the
region-growing process. The value of this parameter is related
to the maximal thickness of the myocardial wall, which typically
ranges from 6 to 16 mm [2]. Thus, dw was set as dw = 16 mm.
For the RV epicardium, typically, the seed region is controlled
by dout = 2 mm and dout = 3 mm, and set dw = 5 mm.

points.

Evolution of cut contours generated from ten randomly sampled apex

The sparse level set method [33] was utilized to implement
gradient descent flows derived from the active contour models
in (5) and (7) for its efficiency. In particular, the upwind scheme
was used in discretizing |∇(·)| (see [34] for details). The endocardium and epicardium masks were refined separately. The
radius of the ball B(x, y) was set as r = 4 mm.
B. Robustness Test
Locating the LV is a key step in the overall framework. To
test the robustness of this step, sample points randomly selected
from a neighborhood within 30 mm of the apex point were used
as trial apex points to start the localization process. To quantify
errors, the distance between the cut contours obtained using
different sample points and the original contour was measured
as
	
C̃ (s) D(C)ds
	
.
(9)
Dist(C, C̃) =
C̃ (s) ds
Here, C, C̃, and D are the original cut contour, the cut contour
obtained from a sample point, and the distance between them,
respectively. In our implementation, D(C) was evaluated at
triangle vertices. The evolution process of Dist(C, C̃) for 10
sample points is shown in Fig. 10. All of the curves converge
to the original C within a tolerable numerical error. In addition,
the averages of the turning point d˜ are 94 ± 9 mm and 76 ±
6 mm for the human and pig data, respectively. This shows that
the feature used for identifying the cut contour is stable despite
of the variability in heart shapes.
Our method succeeded in localizing the LV and RV for all
of the testing data with wide shape variations and different
volume coverages. Typical segmentation results returned by the
proposed method are shown in Fig. 11 displayed with manual
segmentations. The first row is a normal human case with small
field of view (FOV) and the second is a pig case with wide FOV.

the second is for a pig case with large papillary muscles and

from these results, the papillary muscles and soft tissues were
successfully excluded from the myocardium.

C. Quantitative Analysis
The segmentation results from the proposed method were validated by two doctors who were blind to the method. One doctor delineated the human dataset, the other did the pig dataset.
To make a fair comparison, all testing datasets were resampled to the same resolution of the manual segmentations at

detected by first identifying the endocardium and then segmenting the epicardium. In addition, the LV segmentation results
are used to localize the RV. The local variations of the heart
are naturally handled by utilizing features obtained online. Its
performance has been evaluated by measuring the errors between automatic and manual segmentations. In these tests, the
proposed method achieves high accuracy as well as strong robustness for segmenting the myocardial wall from both human
and pig datasets with large shape variabilities and different volume coverages. In future work, we plan to apply the segmentations from the proposed approach to clinical applications such
as evaluating the myocardial mass at risk caused by stenoses.
APPENDIX

1.0 mm × 1.0 mm × 1.0 mm. The mean and standard deviation
of the point-to-surface errors for the human and pig datasets
at the localization and refinement steps are summarized in Table I. These results demonstrate that the localization step locates
the endocardium and epicardium masks with high precision as
compared to the manual segmentations, which are further refined by applying the active contour model with the shape constraint. Note that the accuracy of the endocardium segmentation
is better than the epicardium segmentation as the former is better defined due to the higher contrast between the blood pool
and the myocardium, while in the latter case, poor contrast and
weak edges are present between the epicardium and background
tissues.
In addition, the proposed method was compared to a stateof-the-art active contour method, i.e., the localized PCA-based
method [35], [36], for segmenting pig ventricles using the same
dataset. The point-to-surface errors are summarized in Table II.
In addition, the statistical differences between these two methods were analyzed by utilizing the two-sample t-test, with null
hypothesis as “the PCA-based method has a smaller mean error
than the proposed method,” for LV-Endo, LV-Epi, RV-Endo, and
RV-Epi. The test rejects the null hypothesis at the 1% significance level for all of the four cases. As indicated by these results,
the proposed method statistically has a higher accuracy for segmenting both ventricles as it captures more local image content
than the PCA-based method, which relies on the subspace where
the heart shape is embedded.
Though it is hard to make a fair comparison between different methods for human ventricle segmentation by using different datasets, the accuracy of the proposed method seems
to be competitive with some latest results: 1.13 ± 0.55 and
1.21 ± 0.41 mm [11], 0.98 ± 1.32 and 0.82 ± 1.07 mm [10] for
LV endocardium and epicardium, respectively. Note that, the
comparison was only made to the LV segmentation because the
approaches being compared model the RV endocardium and
epicardium as a single component.

A narrow band method is applied to implement the gradient
flow. Specifically, U is realized as the signed distance function

of U is positive in the region that contains the apex point.

The key step is to numerically approximate the gradient and
divergence operators on a surface. The discretization schemes
of [23] were adopted as they naturally capture the geometric
properties of surfaces.

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH
We have presented an automatic method for segmenting the
ventricles from cardiac CT images. The method sequentially
segments the LV and RV via integrating shape segmentation
with region-growing techniques. In particular, each ventricle is

We especially wish to acknowledge our deep gratitude to Dr.
Faber who had helped to push this research forward and devoted
her life to cardiac image analysis. We would also like to thank
Dr. Ernest Garcia of Emory from some useful discussions about
the topic of this paper.
