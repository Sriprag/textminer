Hypoxic-State Estimation of Brain Cells by Using
Wireless Near-Infrared Spectroscopy
Jinn-Rung Kuo, Bor-Shyh Lin, Member, IEEE, Chih-Lun Cheng, and Chung-Ching Chio

Abstract—Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a modern measuring technology in neuroscience. It can be used to noninvasively
measure the relative concentrations of oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb)
and deoxyhemoglobin (DeoHb), which can reflect information related to cerebral blood volume and cerebral oxygen saturation.
Therefore, it has the potential for noninvasive monitoring of cerebral ischemia. However, there is still a lack of reliable physiological information on the relationship between the concentrations
of OxyHb and DeoHb in cerebral blood and the exact hypoxic
state of brain cells under cerebral ischemia. In this study, we describe a wireless multichannel NIRS system, which we designed
to noninvasively monitor the relative concentrations of OxyHb
and DeoHb in bilateral cerebral blood before, during, and after
middle cerebral artery occlusion. By comparing the results with
the lactate/pyruvate ratio measured by microdialysis, we investigated the correlation between the relative concentrations of OxyHb
and DeoHb in cerebral blood and the hypoxic state of brain cells.
The results showed that the relationship between the concentration
changes of DeoHb in cerebral blood and the hypoxic state of brain
cells was significant. Therefore, by monitoring the changes in concentrations of DeoHb, the wireless NIRS can be used to estimate
the hypoxic state of brain cells indirectly.

I. INTRODUCTION
TROKE (brain attack) ranks as the third leading cause of
disability and death worldwide. It can be classified into two
major states: cerebral ischemia and hemorrhagic state [1], [2].
Previous studies have indicated that up to 80% of strokes result
from cerebral ischemia due to occlusion of an artery (ischemia

stroke), typically by blood clots in the middle cerebral artery
(MCA) [3]. Cerebral ischemia results in low oxygen and glucose supply due to the decrease of blood flow, and it also causes
a decrease in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
due to a decrease of the acid cycle [4]–[6]. A lack of oxygen
and glucose supply to the brain may lead to failure of energydependent processes and cause irreversible brain cell injury and
death [7], [8]. Therefore, in order to prevent or diagnose ischemic strokes, it is important to monitor and understand the
pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia.
In order to monitor ischemic strokes, several physiological
information retrieval techniques have been developed [9], [10].
For example, microdialysis is a useful neuromedical technique
used to monitor brain ischemia, hyperemia, hemorrhage, and
even various kinds of physiological parameters in the brain.
Microdialysis is a minimally invasive technique for sampling
the chemistry of the interstitial fluid of organs and tissues. In
1990, Hillered et al. [11] first used microdialysis to monitor the
chemistry in the brain tissue during surgical operations for tumors. By measuring glucose and glycerol metabolites, changes
in the lactate/pyruvate ratio (L/P ratio) can provide physiological information related to the lack of oxygen in brain cells.
Pyruvate in the cell is converted to acetyl-CoA via a pyruvate
dehydrogenase reaction under aerobic condition or lactate under anaerobic condition. Therefore, the L/P ratio has become an
important parameter in diagnose of ischemic strokes. Although
microdialysis can be applied to monitor ischemic strokes effectively, it also has the main disadvantages of being invasive and
only being able to provide nonreal-time measurements.
Several noninvasive techniques such as magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), X-ray computed tomography (CT), and positron
emission tomography (PET) have also been widely used to monitor variations in cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism
in brain ischemia [10], [12], [13]. However, CT uses ionizing radiation and PET requires radioactive tracers to produce
the images. Even though MRI is safer than CT and PET, its
temporal resolution is obviously poorer and it is a more expensive procedure [14]. Moreover, none of these techniques is suitable for long-term monitoring of cerebral ischemia. Recently,
near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been applied in cerebral
science and neuroscience [15]. For near-infrared light, oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) and deoxyhemoglobin (DeoHb) exhibit the
most significant absorbance in the blood. Since blood delivers
oxygen to tissue by local conversion of OxyHb and DeoHb,
the relative concentrations of OxyHb and DeoHb can reflect
information related to cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume (CBV), and cerebral oxygen saturation [16]. Compared to
PET, CT, and MRI, NIRS has the advantages of biochemical

specificity, low cost, high temporal resolution, and the
potential to measure intracellular and intravascular events
simultaneously.
In 1993, Hirtz [17] first hypothesized that NIRS could be
used to monitor stroke patients. Subsequent studies then started
to investigate the application of NIRS systems on focal cerebral ischemia in rats [18]–[22]. In 1997, Wolf et al. [18] used
NIRS to identify peri-infarct depolarizations from the concentration changes of OxyHb, DeoHb, and the oxidized form of
cytochrome aa3. Vernieri et al. [19] performed NIRS and transcranial Doppler simultaneously to evaluate the effects of hypercapnia by monitoring the change of backscattered light intensity
related to blood volume. Culver et al. [20] used a diffuse optical
tomography device to concurrently obtain coregistered images
of relative CBV, tissue-averaged hemoglobin oxygen saturation,
and relative cerebral blood flow under rat MCA occlusion. Xia
et al. [21] used NIRS to assess the concentration changes of
OxyHb and total-hemoglobin concentration (HbT) during acute
focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. In 2010, Li et al. [22]
developed a noninvasive electrooptical method using the peak
changes in the relative absorption of pulsed near-infrared light
to quantify brain oxygenation during ischemia and hypoxia in
anesthetized rabbits. Most previous studies have focused on
changes of CBV, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and cerebral
blood flow under cerebral ischemia. However, there is still a
lack of data on the relationship between the concentrations of
OxyHb and DeoHb in cerebral blood and the hypoxic state of
brain cells under cerebral ischemia.
In this study, we describe a wireless multichannel NIRS system that we designed to noninvasively monitor the relative concentrations of OxyHb and DeoHb in bilateral cerebral blood in
real time, before, during, and after MCA occlusion. By comparing the results with the L/P ratio measured by microdialysis, we investigated the correlation between variations in the
concentration of OxyHb and DeoHb in cerebral blood and the
hypoxic state of brain cells. Rat brain slices were stained with
triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) to confirm the irreversibly
infarcted regions of the brain caused by MCA occlusion. The
total hemoglobin concentration (HbT) for cerebral ischemia was
investigated. This paper is organized as follows. The theoretical
models of tissue optics and the implementation of the proposed
wireless multichannel NIRS system are introduced in Section
II. In Section III, the experiment design for the focal cerebral
ischemia rat model is introduced. In Section IV, the correlations
between DeoHb, OxyHb, and L/P ratio before, during, and after MCA occlusion are investigated, and the total hemoglobin
concentration for cerebral ischemia is also investigated. Finally,
the conclusion is drawn in Section V.

II. METHODS
A. Implementation of the Wireless Multichannel NIRS System
We designed a wireless multichannel NIRS system to continuously monitor concentration variations of DeoHb and OxyHb
under MCA occlusion, the system architecture of which is
shown in Fig. 1, consisting of a light emitting-detecting probe

system.

and a wireless signal acquisition module. The light emittingdetecting probe was designed to make contact with subjects
or animals, provide a near-infrared light source, and detect
diffusely reflected near-infrared light. The backboard of light
emitting-detecting probe was made of rubber to provide high
flexibility to adapt the head shape of the animal. And a disposable twin-adhesive plate is used to firmly bind the rat head and
the contact side of the light emitting-detecting probe. The wireless signal acquisition module was designed to drive the nearinfrared light-emitting diode (SMT735/850, EPITEX, Japan),
and amplify and acquire the near-infrared signal detected by the
photodiode (PD15-22 C/TR8, EVERLIGHT, Taiwan). And each
light source can provide about 0.3 mW. The sampling rate is set
to 20 Hz, and the time-series diagram of dual-wavelength illumination and acquisition is shown in Fig. 2. The light emittingdetecting probe can be firmly attached to subjects or animals,
and then the near-infrared light will penetrate through biological
tissues where the light will be scattered and absorbed, and some
pass through the tissues. The photodiode on the light emittingdetecting probe receives the diffusely reflected light on the same
side of the light source, and this diffusely reflected light contains physiological information related to the biological tissues
through which it penetrates. In general, the penetration depth is
about half of the distance between the light source and detector.
Therefore, the target location of where to monitor the concentration changes of OxyHb and DeoHb can be set accordingly [23].
Our multichannel NIRS system acquires and amplifies the intensity of diffusely reflected light, converts it from an analog signal
to a digital signal and then transmits the signal wirelessly to a

in OxyHb and DeoHb concentrations are calculated using the
modified Beer–Lambert law (MBLL). Photographs of the light
emitting-detecting probe and wireless signal acquisition module
are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively.
B. Theoretical Models of Tissue Optics
The variations in the concentrations of OxyHb and DeoHb can
be quantified by using the modified Beer–Lambert law. Previous
studies have proven that the MBLL is an empirical description of
optical attenuation in biological tissues. The variation of diffuse
reflectance caused by variations in the concentrations of OxyHb
or DeoHb [24], [25] can be expressed as
ΔOD = −log

If
= εΔCLB
I0

(1)

where ΔOD is the variation of diffuse reflectance, and If and
I0 are the final and initial intensities of diffusely reflected light,
respectively. ε and ΔC denote the extinction coefficient and the
concentration change corresponding to specific chromophore,
respectively. L is the distance between emitting LED and PD,
and B is the differential path-length factor (DPF), which is
a scaling factor relating to the light source–detector distance
to the true optical path-length traveled by the scattered light.
Absorption coefficient μa can be expressed as
μa =



εi Ci .

i

In the near-infrared wavelength range, the absorptions of water and lard are far less than those of OxyHb and DeoHb [26].
Therefore, the absorptions of OxyHb and DeoHb are mainly
considered in the absorption model. Equation (1) then can be
rewritten as follows:
ΔODλ = (ελOxyHb Δ[OxyHb] + ελDeoHb Δ[DeoHb])B λ L.
(3)
Here, λ denotes the wavelength of the emitted light, and
Δ[OxyHb] and Δ[DeoHb] are the concentration changes
of OxyHb and DeoHb, respectively. In order to calculate
Δ[OxyHb] and Δ[DeoHb], at least two different wavelengths

The wavelengths of λ1 and λ2 have to straddle the isosbestic
point, which is the superposition of the absorption spectra of
OxyHb and DeoHb, and they were set as 735 and 850 nm,
respectively, in this study. Under the assumption that all biological tissues are a semi-infinite medium [25], the parameter B
can then be expressed by,

(6)
where μs is the transport scattering coefficient. Equation (6)
shows that B depends on the tissue scattering coefficient and
initial chromophore concentration. The parameter B can be
regarded as being independent to μa due to that the parameter
B is empirically determined and the influence of μa is actually
small [25]. Finally, the change Δ[HbT] in HbT can be obtained
by
Δ[HbT] = Δ[OxyHb] + Δ[DeoHb].

III. EXPERIMENTS FOR FOCAL CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA
RAT MODELS
A. Animals Preparation
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (weight: 325 ± 25 g) were
used in this experiment. All of the rats were kept under a 12h light/12-h dark cycle, and allowed access to food and water
freely. All experimental procedures conformed to the guidelines
of the National Institute of Health, Taiwan, and were approved
by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Chi Mei Medical
Center to minimize discomfort to the rats during surgery and
the recovery period. The rats were randomly assigned to two
groups: Group 1 (n = 6) was monitored using the proposed
NIRS system under MCA occlusion; and Group 2 (n = 6) was
monitored using microdialysis. All of the animals were anesthetized with sodium pentothal (25 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.);
Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO) and a mixture containing
ketamine (44 mg/kg, intramuscular (i.m.); Nan Kuang Pharmaceutical, Tainan, Taiwan), atropine (0.02633 mg/kg, i.m.;
Sintong Chemical Industrial Co. Ltd., Taoyuan, Taiwan), and
xylazine (6.77 mg/kg, i.m.; Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). All
of the rats were sacrificed on the third day postsurgery, and rat
brain slices were stained with TTC solution.
B. Experiment Design for Ischemic Stroke
In order to research human stroke, several models of focal
cerebral ischemia have been developed, and it has been found

the rats were then monitored continuously for 60 min under
MCA occlusion. Next, we removed the monofilament suture
to produce MCA reperfusion. The rats were still monitored
continuously for 60 min after reperfusion. After all experimental
procedures, all incisions on the rats were sutured with surgical
wound sutures. Fig. 5(a) and (b) shows the photographs of a rat
monitored by microdialysis and our NIRS system, respectively,
under MCA occlusion.

anterior–posterior −0.5 mm and lateral +3.5 mm from the bregma, under the
top of the rat brain by 7 mm (includes 1 mm rat skull). Microdialysis catheter

that up to 80% of strokes result from ischemic damage in the
MCA area [3]. Therefore, MCA occlusion has become the main
prototype in focal cerebral ischemic rat models. In this study,
we also used MCA occlusion as the focal cerebral ischemic rat
model. Before MCA occlusion, the rats were first anesthetized,
and then the head was placed in a stereotaxic frame, and inserted
and tightened by the ear bars. Next, a rectal temperature probe
attached to the thermostatic controller was inserted into the
colon of the rat to maintain the core temperature at 37 ◦ C.
The locations that the light emitting-detecting probe and the
microdialysis catheter were placed are shown in Fig. 4(a).
The experimental procedure of cerebral ischemia followed the
experimental design of Belayev et al. [27]. For MCA occlusion,
the rat was reversed, and a 25-mm surgical midline incision
was made to expose the right common carotid artery (CCA),
external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery (ICA),
and a 4–0 nylon suture was used to dissect the artery from
surrounding nerves and fascia under an operating microscope.
Two knots of 4–0 nylon suture were tied around the right CCA
and ECA to obstruct blood flow, and then a small puncture was
opened in the right ECA, and a 23 mm monofilament suture
was inserted from the right ECA through the ICA until the
tip occluded the MCA [see Fig. 4(b)]. Before MCA occlusion
was performed, microdialysis and the proposed wireless NIRS
system recorded 60 and 10 min of baseline data, respectively.
MCA occlusion surgery was completed within 5–10 min, and

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The correlations between the changes of OxyHb, DeoHb, and
L/P ratio under MCA occlusion and reperfusion were investigated to determine the exact hypoxic state of brain cells with
regards to the concentration changes of OxyHb and DeoHb in
cerebral blood. Fig. 6(a) and (b) shows the temporal profiles of
Δ[OxyHb] and Δ[DeoHb] obtained from the ischemia side and
contralateral side (nonischemia side), respectively, during the
MCA occlusion. The results showed that Δ[OxyHb] dropped
and Δ[DeoHb] increased immediately during MCA occlusion,
indicating that the cerebral blood of the rats was under extremely low oxygen supply during this period. Δ[OxyHb] and
Δ[DeoHb] still maintained a lower and a higher concentration than their baseline values, respectively, during MCA occlusion. During MCA reperfusion, Δ[OxyHb] and Δ[DeoHb]
gradually increased and decreased, respectively, and the value
of Δ[OxyHb] became higher than that for Δ[DeoHb]. This
indicates that the oxygenated blood was flowing into the brain
through the MCA. However, Δ[OxyHb] dropped at about 6 min
after MCA reperfusion, and Δ[DeoHb] increased at the same
time. Subsequently, Δ[DeoHb] returned to a higher value than
Δ[OxyHb]. Compared to Fig. 6(b), the changes of Δ[OxyHb]
and Δ[DeoHb] in the contralateral side were not significant
during MCA occlusion and reperfusion.
Next, the time courses of average and standard errors of mean
(SEM) of Δ[OxyHb], Δ[DeoHb] and the total hemoglobin concentration Δ[HbT] in the ischemia and contralateral sides were
analyzed and are shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively.
Repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) for differences between time points and groups was used to analyze
experimental data, and significance was set at a value of P
< 0.05. The results showed that the changes of Δ[OxyHb]
and Δ[DeoHb] in the ischemia side were statistically significant. At the beginning of MCA occlusion, Δ[OxyHb] in

the ischemia side dropped from 3.05 ± 1.90 to −16.66 ±
8.48 μM, and Δ[DeoHb] increased from 2.55 ± 1.67 to 25.53
± 8.97 μM. Δ[OxyHb] increased to 9.75 ± 10.17 μM gradually, and Δ[DeoHb] dropped to 3.4 ± 5.46 μM during MCA
reperfusion. However, Δ[OxyHb] then decreased gradually and
became lower than Δ[DeoHb] and its baseline within 10 min.
In the contralateral side, Δ[OxyHb] was slightly lower than
Δ[DeoHb] during MCA occlusion, and then increased slightly
during MCA occlusion [see Fig. 7(b)]. Finally, Δ[OxyHb] remained slightly higher than Δ[DeoHb] during the period of
MCA reperfusion. The total hemoglobin concentration Δ[HbT]
is related to the relative total blood volume in living tissue [28].
The results showed that the variations of Δ[HbT] in the ischemia
side and contralateral side were slight during MCA occlusion
and reperfusion.
The time course of the L/P ratio (n = 6) monitored using microdialysis is shown in Fig. 8. The MCA occlusion control and
sham data were recorded from the ischemia side and contralateral side, respectively. The results showed that the change of L/P
ratio was also statistically significant in the ischemia side. The
L/P ratio increased dramatically from 32.42 ± 16.54 to 323.48
± 118.08 during MCA occlusion, and the difference between
MCA occlusion control and sham data was about 291.06. The

infarcted regions (ischemia side) and normal regions (contralateral side) in the rat brain slices with TTC staining are shown in
Fig. 9, and the striatum regions of the brains have been marked.
This clearly indicates that the low oxygen supply to the striatum
region caused irreversible brain cell injury or death.
The correlations between L/P ratio, Δ[OxyHb] and
Δ[DeoHb] are shown in Fig. 10(a) and (b). The results showed
that the correlation between L/P ratio and Δ[OxyHb] was
−0.60 (p = 0.0005), and the correlation between L/P ratio and
Δ[DeoHb] was 0.82 (p = 0.0000). Although the time courses
of Δ[OxyHb] and Δ[DeoHb] after MCA reperfusion were

due to multiple factors as followings. During the occlusion
period, a reduction in the oxygen supply results in a severe
failure of metabolic energy support, which leads to structure
damage, cell ischemia, even cell death through reperfusion period [30]. Reperfusion and reoxygenation of the ischemia tissue
may provide chemical substrate for further increasing cellular
damage and even cell death [31]. Oxygen supplied by reperfusion was insufficient to meet the oxygen demand of the postischemia hypermetabolic state of cells after ischemia. [32], [33].
Therefore, the value of the Δ[OxyHb] was higher but the L/R
ratio remained high (477 ± 166.76) during the reperfusion
period.

V. CONCLUSION

different from that of L/P ratio, the correlation between L/P
ratio and Δ[DeoHb] was high and the correlation between L/P
ratio, Δ[OxyHb], and Δ[DeoHb] was still significant.
The results of a study by Zaharchunk et al. [28] also indicated
that the reduction of microvascular CBV is more significant than
that of total CBV after MCA reperfusion. In edema, intravascular cell aggregates such as platelets and polymorphonuclear
leukocytes, rheological changes due to hemoconcentration, endothelial microvilli formation, and vasomotion due to the release of vasoactive mediators have all been postulated to lead to
a postischemic decrease in cerebral perfusion [29]. Therefore,
during the main trunk of MCA occlusion period, cells distal to
the occlusion area became ischemia, which would induce blood
flow diverted from the microvasculature bed to thoroughfare
channels, causing a decrease in capillary perfusion and a shift in
blood volume from the microvasculature to this ischemia area.
And it also results in the sight increase of HbT during MCA
occlusion. The stability of Δ[HbT] was maintained after MCA
reperfusion.
Comparing the value of Δ[OxyHb] and L/R ratio during
MCA reperfusion period, it showed that the Δ[OxyHb] became higher; however, the L/R ratio still remained high (477 ±
166.76) during reperfusion period. This discrepancy may be

In this study, we described a wireless multichannel NIRS
system that we designed to noninvasively monitor the relative
concentrations of OxyHb and DeoHb in bilateral cerebral blood
before, during, and after MCA occlusion. By comparing the
results with the L/P ratio measured from microdialysis, the
correlation between the relative concentrations of OxyHb and
DeoHb in cerebral blood and the hypoxic state of brain cells
were also investigated. The results showed that Δ[OxyHb] decreased and Δ[DeoHb] increased in the ischemia area during
MCA occlusion. This indicates that the cerebral blood has an
extremely low oxygen supply during MCA occlusion. The value
of the L/P ratio also increased dramatically during MCA occlusion, indicating the failure of metabolic reactions caused by
the low oxygen and glucose supply to the rat brains. During the
surgical period of MCA reperfusion, Δ[OxyHb] and Δ[DeoHb]
in the ischemia area gradually increased and decreased, respectively, due to oxygenated blood flowing into the brain through
the MCA. However, Δ[OxyHb] dropped within a few minutes
after MCA reperfusion, and became lower than Δ[DeoHb] and
its baseline. In contrast to the time courses of Δ[OxyHb] and
Δ[DeoHb] after MCA reperfusion, the value of the L/P ratio
remained high. However, the correlation between L/P ratio and
Δ[DeoHb] was still high. Therefore, by monitoring the changes
in concentrations of DeoHb, the wireless NIRS can be used to
estimate the hypoxic state of brain cells indirectly.
