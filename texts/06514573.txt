Probability of Severe Adverse Events as a Function
of Hospital Occupancy
Justin Boyle, Kathryn Zeitz, Richard Hoffman, Sankalp Khanna, and John Beltrame

Abstract—A unique application of regression modeling is described to compare hospital bed occupancy with reported severe
adverse events amongst inpatients. The probabilities of the occurrence of adverse events as a function of hospital occupancy are
calculated using logistic and multinomial regression models. All
models indicate that higher occupancy rates lead to an increase
in adverse events. The analysis identified that at an occupancy
level of 100%, there is a 22% chance of one severe event occurring and a 28% chance of at least one severe event occurring. This
modeling contributes evidence toward the management of hospital
occupancy to benefit patient outcomes.
Index Terms—Biomedical informatics, hospitals, prediction algorithms, regression analysis.

I. INTRODUCTION
N many countries, demand for hospital beds has increased
through an increased population, increased elderly numbers,
increased community expectations, increased provision of hospital services, and a higher availability of therapeutic interventions [1]. There are pressures that all hospitals face to match
this demand with available beds in order to get unwell patients
into hospital beds in a timely manner. This activity has become more challenging in that the demand increases have taken
place in finite capacity health systems, where bed stocks and
staff resources have remained fairly constant on a per-capita
basis [1], [2].
The focus of recent policy by many governments has been
to improve access to beds and reduce waiting times for people
requiring hospital care (e.g., [3], [4]). Performance targets related to patient access as well as revenue targets contribute to
pressures on hospitals to maximize the utilization of beds.
An alternate view in the face of such pressures is that patient
safety is compromised when hospital beds are filled to capacity
[5]. However, the evidence around this—specifically whether

higher inpatient occupancy equates to a higher likelihood of an
adverse event, is minimal. There has been a strong articulation
of the need to use patient outcome measures rather than process
measures to judge health system function [6] as well as requests
for evidence-based debate on this issue [5]–[8].
There have been numerous studies assessing the impact of
emergency department, patient safety, and patient flow [2], but
research on the effect of occupancy on the safety of patients
admitted to hospital beds is scant.
Sprivulis et al. [9] looked at the effect that hospital occupancy
has on admission times for people waiting in the emergency
department and their subsequent mortality. The authors found
that increased hospital occupancy led to longer waiting times
within the emergency department and an increase in mortality
at days 2 and 7. An 85% occupancy rate is the suggested target
occupancy by Sprivulis et al. to allow for “efficient inpatient
flow” and minimize access block-related mortality [9].
In a study of four hospitals over 12 months, Weissman
et al. [10] found that the rate of adverse events in one hospital
was affected by the number of admissions for the day and the
patient to nurse ratio. However, the other variables assessed—
occupancy rate, the number of discharges for the day, and diagnosis related groups (to account for case complexity) were not
significantly related to adverse events in any of their study sites.
Schilling et al. [11] analyzed the relationship of high hospital
occupancy, increased nurse staffing levels, weekend admissions,
and seasonal influenza with predicted probability of death versus
actual number of deaths. The study found that each of the factors
had a statistically significant association with in-hospital mortality. Of the four factors, high hospital occupancy, had the third
greatest influence on patient mortality leading to an increase in
0.24% points of actual death versus predicted death (95% CI
0.06–0.43) [11]. Because it is difficult to ascertain when the patient’s illness ultimately becomes fatal, Schilling et al. looked at
hospital occupancy on the day of admission. It may have been
several days after admission, however, with a different level of
hospital occupancy, that the patient became fatally ill. A better
understanding of the consequences of high hospital occupancy
on the occurrence of all severe adverse events (not just mortality)
could help inform capacity management policies.
Understanding the probability of severe adverse events within
the inpatient population as a function of hospital occupancy enables the development of appropriate resources and interventions to minimize these adverse events. By increasing knowledge within this field, it is hoped that hospitals can improve the
management of hospital occupancy to benefit patient outcomes.
In this study, it was desired to apply regression modeling
to examine the effect of occupancy on severe adverse events

using a hospital inpatient cohort. Severe adverse events reported
in a major accredited teaching hospital cross-matched to bed
occupancy across a one-year time period were analyzed using
logistic and multinomial regression models. This resulted in
derivations of the probabilities of the occurrence of such events
as a function of hospital occupancy.

ADVERSE EVENT SEVERITY

II. METHOD
A. Study Site
This study was part of a larger project exploring the relationship between daily hospital occupancy rates and the occurrence of all reported adverse events from an inpatient population
within an Australian public hospital. It was undertaken in South
Australia at the Royal Adelaide Hospital—the state’s largest
teaching hospital with a capacity of approximately 650 acute
care beds and 65 000 emergency presentations per year. Information relating to adverse events and occupancy was collected
from hospital information systems for the year July 2009–June
2010 and analyzed on a daily basis. Occupancy was defined
as the number of patients occupying inpatient beds at midnight
compared with the budgeted fixed total hospital bed base.

III. RESULTS
A. Occupancy and Adverse Event Data

B. Adverse Event Data
Clinical staff at the study site can report an adverse event
using:
1) an incident report form;
2) directly online using a computer software program—the
advanced incident management system (AIMS);
3) a 24-h contact center staffed by nurses.
These reports are then entered into AIMS and reviewed by
the management of the health service. All incidents are assessed
against a safety assessment code or SAC, which allocates a
numeric score to the incident which guides the organization in
appropriate management and action [12].
The SAC matrix categorizes incidents according to four levels based on consequence/severity and likelihood/probability.
SAC1 incidents are adverse events that result in extreme or major harm to patients. Sentinel events are automatically grouped
in this highest acuity level (SAC1) regardless of the outcome
to the patient. Events categorized as SAC1 must be investigated
by means of a root cause analysis (see Table I for examples of
each of the four SAC levels).
The focus of the analysis was on severe (SAC1 and SAC2)
adverse events due to their link with patient outcomes.
C. Probability Modeling
It was desired to determine the probabilities of severe adverse
events occurring as a function of occupancy. The probability of
an adverse event occurring was determined by collapsing daily
counts to a binary outcome representing whether an event occurred or not, and using logistic regression to quantify the relationship with occupancy—see Section III-B. The probabilities
of specific counts of severe events occurring per day (zero, one,
two, etc. events/day) were then determined using multinomial
logistic regression—see Section III-C.

The median bed occupancy (midnight census) across the analysis period was 97.1% (IQR: 93.8–100.2%), and was significantly higher (p < 0.001) on weekdays (median 98.0%, IQR
95.2–100.9%) compared to weekends (median 94.7%, IQR
91.0–97.2%).
Out of 2611 reported adverse events, 20 (1%) were coded
as SAC1 events (most severe) and 94 (4%) as SAC2 events.
Across the 12 month study period, 45% (n = 51) of severe adverse events were related to clinical management, 43%
(n = 49) were related to falls and 12% (n = 14) were related
to medication. Fig. 1 shows that at most there were three SAC1
[see Fig. 1(a)] and SAC2 [see Fig. 1(b)] adverse events reported
each day.
Half of the SAC1 events occurred above an occupancy level
of 99% and half of the SAC2 events occurred above an occupancy level of 98%. This is noteworthy considering that median
hospital occupancy across the whole year was 97%. One capacity management action arising from these observations may be
to use the results to set appropriate thresholds based on historic
patterns.
B. Probability of at Least One Severe Event Per Day
The effect of occupancy on the probability of at least one
severe incident is shown in Fig. 2. The data circles indicate historical daily counts collapsed to binary outcomes (representing
event occurrence or not) and the probability as a function of
occupancy is given by the fitted curve.
The probability P of at least one severe event per day is
log(P/(1 − P )) = −5.49 + 4.55X, where X = occupancy.

and day-of-the-week.

Fig. 2.

Probability of at least one severe (SAC1/SAC2) event/day.

The positive regression coefficient (4.55) means that the occupancy explanatory variable increases the probability of a safety
incident occurring. The modeling determined that for a 1% increase in occupancy, the odds of at least one severe (SAC1
or SAC2) event occurring increases by a factor of 1.05 (95%
CI: 1.00–1.10). Fig. 3 includes 95% confidence bounds for the
predicted values.
From Fig. 3, it can be seen that at 80% occupancy, there is
around 15% probability of at least one severe adverse event,
which increases to 20% probability at 90% occupancy, and
around 28% probability at 100% occupancy.

One measure of model fit is the significance of the overall
model. This test determines whether the model with occupancy
as a predictor fits significantly better than a model with just
an intercept (i.e., a null model). The aforementioned model as
a whole fits significantly better than an empty model (likelihood ratio test: distributed chi-squared value χ2 = 4.1, with one
degree of freedom, and associated p-value = 0.04).
Including days of the week as individual predictor variables
improves the fit significantly (χ2 = 5.2, one-DOF p = 0.02).
The model (see Fig. 4) then becomes:
log(P/(1 − P )) = −7.79 + 6.28X + 0.15W

(3)

where X = occupancy (1 = 100%), and W = day of the week
(Sunday = 1, Saturday = 7).
C. Probability of Zero, One, Two, or Three Severe Events/Day
Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine the
effect of occupancy on the probability of the counts of severe
events occurring per day, i.e., the probability of zero, one, two,
or three severe events occurring each day.

Fig. 5. Probabilities of zero, one, two or three severe adverse events using
“nominal”-type multinomial logistic regression.

Two model types were compared:
1) “nominal” type, where it was assumed there is no ordering
to the categories of daily event counts;
2) “ordinal” type, where there is actually an order to the
categories of daily event counts.
Fig. 5 shows a “nominal” model, where it is assumed there is
no ordering to the categories:
The model intercepts and coefficient terms describe the relationship between ratios of probabilities:
log(P(1 event) /P(no events) ) = −3.39 + 2.15*Occupancy (4)

“ordinal”-type multinomial logistic regression.

3) SAC1/SAC2 adverse events over no adverse events to increase by exp(0.1154) = 1.12.
So, we can say that the relative risk is higher for higher
occupancy. The actual probabilities shown on the curves in Fig. 5
can be determined based on the knowledge that probabilities of
all states have to sum to unity. That is
P(no events) +P(1 event) +P(2 events) +P(3 events) = 1
where
P(1 event) = exp(−3.39 + 2.15∗ Occupancy)∗ P(no events)

log(P(2 events) /P(no events) ) = −20.70 + 18.17*Occupancy
(5)

(8)
P(2 events) = exp(−20.70 + 18.17∗ Occupancy)∗ P(no events)

log(P(3 events) /P(no events) ) = −15.77 + 11.54*Occupancy.
(6)
For a one unit change in the variable occupancy, the log of
the ratio of the two probabilities, P(1 event) /P(no events) , will be
increased by 2.15, the log of the ratio of the two probabilities
P(2 events) /P(no events) will be increased by 18.17, etc. Therefore,
we can say that, the higher the occupancy level, the more chance
of adverse events (one, two or three events per day) compared
to no events per day.
If we consider 1% occupancy intervals, the log of the ratios
of P(1 event) to P(no events) increases by 2.15/100 or 0.0215 for
every 1% increase in occupancy.
The ratio of the probability of one outcome category over
the probability of the reference category is often referred to
as relative risk. So another way of interpreting the regression
results is in terms of relative risk. We can say that for a 1%
increase in occupancy, we expect the relative risk of:
1) SAC1/SAC2 adverse event over no adverse events to increase by exp(0.0215) = 1.02;
2) SAC1/SAC2 adverse events over no adverse events to increase by exp(0.1818) = 1.20;

(7)

(9)
P(3events) = exp(−15.77+11.54∗ Occupancy)∗ P(no events) .
(10)
Fig. 6 shows probabilities derived using an “ordinal” type
of multinomial logistic regression model. Ordinal models do
not include interaction between the multinomial categories and
the coefficients. That is, we fit a model with a common set
of coefficients for the occupancy predictor variable, across all
multinomial categories (parallel regression).
The coefficients for the ordered logit model (α1 = 6.02,
α2 = 7.85, α3 = 9.75, β = −5.11) are used to define the
following probability relationships:
log

P0
= α1 + βX
1 − P0

(11)

where X = hospital occupancy and P0 = the probability of no
severe events/day. Rearranging (11) gives
P0 =

1
1+

e−(α 1 +β X )

.

The probabilities of other states can be found by expanding
the logit terms as follows:
P0 + P1
= α2 + βX
1 − P0 − P1

= α3 + βX, and
1 − P0 − P1 − P2

P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1.

(15)

For a one unit increase in occupancy, we would expect a
5.11 change in the expected log value of the probability of
different severe adverse event daily numbers. Since occupancy
is modeled as 1 = 100%, for every 1% occupancy increment,
we would expect a 5.11/100 = 0.05 decrease on the log scale.
For a 1% increase in occupancy, we expect the relative risk of:
1) SAC1/SAC2 adverse event over no adverse events to increase by exp(5.11/100) = 1.05.
2) SAC1/SAC2 adverse events over 1 adverse events to increase by exp(5.11/100) = 1.05.
3) SAC1/SAC2 adverse events over 2 adverse events to increase by exp(5.11/100) = 1.05.
For an increase of just 1% in hospital occupancy, the odds of
moving to a higher number of severe adverse events reported
daily is 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01–1.1).
When hospital occupancy increases from its low or first quartile (93.8%) to its high or third quartile (100.2%), the odds of
moving from none to one or more severe adverse events, or from
a level of one or more to higher numbers is multiplied by 1.39
(95% CI: 1.04–1.85).
Comparing the multinomial logistic regression methods
(“nominal”-type versus “ordinal”-type), we find that the “common” increase in relative risks across all multinomial categories
with the ordered logit model (1.05) lies between the varying
relative risks obtained using “nominal”-type multinomial logistic regression (1.02–1.12). The proportional odds assumptions
of using an “ordinal”-type model were tested and given that it
could be argued that an ordering does exist between categories
of daily event counts, and noting that the probability curves
depicted in Fig. 6 appear reasonable, the ordered logit model
seems appropriate.
The interpretation of this multinomial regression modeling is
that as hospital occupancy increases, the probability of having
no safety incidents decreases, while the probability of one or
two or three incidents per day increases, although it remains
low (below 50% chance).
At a hospital occupancy level of 80%, there is a 10% chance
of one severe incident, increasing to 20% chance at 95% occupancy, and 30% chance at 110% occupancy. Fig. 7 includes
95% confidence intervals around predicted probabilities using
the ordered logit model.
IV. DISCUSSION
This study has provided insight into understanding the relationship between hospital occupancy and adverse events within
an inpatient population. The analysis covered two modeling
approaches:

Fig. 7. Probabilities of varying daily counts of severe adverse events including
95% confidence intervals (ordered logit model).

1) logistic regression (logit regression)—based on collapsing
daily counts of adverse events to a binary outcome representing whether an event occurred or not; this determined
that at a hospital occupancy level of 100%, there is a 28%
chance of at least one severe event occurring;
2) multinomial logistic regression (multinomial logit)—
allowing more than two discrete outcomes, which was
used to predict the probabilities of the different possible
outcomes (0, 1, 2, or 3 events per day); this determined
that at a hospital occupancy level of 100%, there is a 22%
chance of one severe event occurring.
All modeling resulted in positive regression coefficients, indicating that as hospital occupancy increases, there is a higher
probability of a severe adverse event occurring.
The work demonstrates an application of multinomial logistic regression using the statistical package “R” which has the
advantages of being free and availability of a good user support
base. It is noted that similar modeling can be performed using
other statistical packages, such as SAS, SPSS, Stata, and MPlus,
which were not investigated in this study.
The management action arising from such analysis is to use
the findings to inform capacity management policy within hospitals. It has been stated [13] that although most adverse events
are preventable, some adverse events cannot be predicted—for
example, drug reactions in patients who had not taken the drugs
previously, or postoperative myocardial infarctions in patients
without previous evidence of heart disease. A typical hospitalization may involve many encounters between a patient and
doctors, nurses, hospital staff, and equipment, and unexpected
results or errors can occur with each encounter, perhaps causing an adverse event. A challenge for hospital management is
determining a capacity level corresponding to an “acceptable”
number of adverse events—and identify the corresponding occupancy level from the probability plots.
The limitation of this analysis is that only one hospital and one
year of data were used to generate the results. Midnight bed occupancy was used as opposed to hourly occupancy, and hourly
occupancy may be considered more appropriate for capacity

20

management as it captures the “churn” that occurs throughout
a day [14]. Information was not available regarding age, comorbidity data, or length of stay information for the affected
patients nor the specialty area within the hospital, and these
effects may influence these results. Finally, adverse event data
were dependent upon “self-report” and thus potentially biased.
A reporting culture is crucial in the detection and management
of adverse events and near misses, and the study site has sought
to determine staff barriers to incident reporting and developed
interventions to overcome identified reporting barriers which
are in active use [12].
Appropriate hospital capacity management is one of the many
solutions to help reduce adverse events. Analysis against other
interventions to reduce adverse events is outside the scope of
this study, but such interventions can include scientific advances
(e.g., developing less hazardous chemotherapeutic agents) [13],
education and standards for practice [13], increased health-care
worker hand-hygiene compliance [15], cohorting of patients
(restricting contact with patients to an assigned health-care
worker) [15], automatic “fail-safe” systems such as computerized systems that makes it impossible to order or dispense
a drug to a patient with a known sensitivity [16], computerized surveillance using natural language processing to mine
electronic medical records [17], falls risk assessment and management programs [18], and developing better mechanisms of
identifying negligent behavior.
Awareness of hospital capacity management as an intervention is required and this study informs the debate and provides
evidence that safety within inpatient wards of hospitals is affected as hospital beds are filled to capacity.
V. CONCLUSION
Hospital managers balance a range of competing priorities
on a daily basis including pressures to optimize bed utilization. The evidence generated through regression analysis has
quantified the probabilities of adverse events as a function of
occupancy and links severe adverse events with high occupancy
levels within a hospital. Any effort to reduce inpatient occupancy is thus crucial from a patient safety perspective.
