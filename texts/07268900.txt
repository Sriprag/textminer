Photoplethysmography Revisited: From Contact
to Noncontact, From Point to Imaging
Yu Sun∗ , Member, IEEE, and Nitish Thakor, Fellow, IEEE

Abstract—Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a noninvasive optical technique for detecting microvascular blood volume changes
in tissues. Its ease of use, low cost and convenience make it an
attractive area of research in the biomedical and clinical communities. Nevertheless, its single spot monitoring and the need to
apply a PPG sensor directly to the skin limit its practicality in
situations such as perfusion mapping and healing assessments or
when free movement is required. The introduction of fast digital
cameras into clinical imaging monitoring and diagnosis systems,
the desire to reduce the physical restrictions, and the possible new
insights that might come from perfusion imaging and mapping inspired the evolution of the conventional PPG technology to imaging
PPG (IPPG). IPPG is a noncontact method that can detect heartgenerated pulse waves by means of peripheral blood perfusion
measurements. Since its inception, IPPG has attracted significant
public interest and provided opportunities to improve personal
healthcare. This study presents an overview of the wide range of
IPPG systems currently being introduced along with examples of
their application in various physiological assessments. We believe
that the widespread acceptance of IPPG is happening, and it will
dramatically accelerate the promotion of this healthcare model in
the near future.
Index Terms—Camera, cellphone, imaging photoplethysmography (PPG) (IPPG), motion artifact, noncontact.

I. INTRODUCTION
EMOTE sensing imaging offers additional value regardless of the parameters being used because it is appealing to the general public and facilitates insights that would
otherwise be difficult or even impossible to obtain. Due to
advances in the areas of integrated circuits, microelectronics
and image/signal processing techniques, the past two decades
have witnessed enormous progress in the development of optical
imaging technologies for various biomedical and clinical applications, such as laser Doppler imaging (LDI) [1], laser speckle
imaging (LSI) [2], photoacoustic tomography (PAT) [3], tissue
viability imaging (TiVi) [4], and imaging photoplethysmography (PPG) (IPPG). Many reviews and books have been written
on LDI, LSI, and PAT (for reviews, see [5]–[8]), which will not
be repeated in this paper. Compared to LDI and LSI, IPPG has
a relatively short history [9], [10]. With the recent evolution of

these optical blood perfusion imaging technologies, it was soon
realized that PPG could be extended to imaging as well. The
primary goal of this topical review is to introduce researchers
who are unfamiliar with IPPG to their use, development, and
applications. We hope that this paper will inform and inspire
uninitiated readers to become consumers of IPPG technology.
All the PPG technologies discussed in this review can be
roughly divided into four groups: single-point contact PPG,
multipoint contact PPG, close/contact IPPG, and noncontact
IPPG. This paper will concentrate on the noncontact IPPG technique, which is a noninvasive optical method for sensing the
blood volume pulse, and it has been proven to be superior in its
ease of use, low cost, safety, convenience, and ability to offer
multiple physiological assessments.
Four general topics will be covered in this paper. First, we
will provide a brief review of the contact PPG technology and
its limitations. An introduction to the fundamental biophysical
concepts related to PPG could help to illustrate the principles
of its extension, IPPG. Second, we will briefly introduce the
current research on wearable and noncontact PPG technology,
which is aimed at reducing the constraints of the conventional
PPG and improving comfort for long-term monitoring. Third,
we will present approaches and precautions for IPPG signal
extraction. Various applications of IPPG and the latest developments in the literature, as well as reviews of the contribution
of IPPG techniques various physiological assessments, will be
introduced. Finally, we will discuss the challenges in IPPG and
suggest several future research directions.
II. PPG
PPG is the core technology upon which IPPG is based. Therefore, an introduction of the fundamental concepts related to PPG
could help to illustrate the principles of IPPG and show the development of the IPPG technique.
A. Background of PPG
As the pioneers who helped to establish the PPG technique,
Hertzman et al. first introduced the term “photoplethysmography” in the 1930s and suggested that it represented the volumetric changes (“plethysmo” means “enlargement” in Greek) in the
dermal vasculature [11], [12]. PPG is a simple and low-cost
optical biomonitoring technique used to noninvasively measure
the blood volume changes that occur in the microvascular tissue bed beneath the skin, which are due to the pulsatile nature
of the circulatory system [13], [14]. Despite its simplicity, our
understanding of the origins of different components of the
PPG signal are still rudimentary. It is generally accepted that
these components could provide valuable information about the

cardiovascular system [14]. Over the last 20 years, there has
been a significant increase in the number of published articles
on PPG (see Fig. 1). The popularity of this topic can be attributed
to the realization that PPG has important implications for a wide
range of applications in cardiovascular system assessment, vital
sign monitoring and blood oxygen detection. For example, in the
early 1990s, pulse oximetry became a mandated international
standard for monitoring during anesthesia [15].
As an optical technique, PPG requires a light source and
a photodetector to function. The light source illuminates the
tissue, and the photodetector senses the small variations in reflected or transmitted light intensity associated with changes in
perfusion in the catchment volume. The fundamental principle
of PPG relies on the differences in sensitivity of different optical wavelengths for blood and other tissue components [16].
Given that the interaction of light with biological tissue can be
complex (including scattering, absorption, reflection, etc.) [17],
the choice of the light source wavelength is very important.
The ideal wavelength(s) for PPG should have greater absorption for blood compared to other tissue components, as this
would allow for accurate monitoring of blood volume changes
in the microvascular tissue bed [18]. It is known that shorter
wavelengths of light are strongly absorbed by melanin, while
water absorbs light in the ultraviolet and longer infrared (IR)
ranges. Therefore, red and near IR light are typically utilized as
light sources in PPG sensors (for a review, see [18]). Recently,
green-wavelength PPG devices are becoming increasingly popular for their large intensity variations in modulation that are observed during the cardiac cycle [19]–[21]. Compared to red/IR
light, green LED has much greater absorptivity for both oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin [22], thus resulting in a better
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Several studies have compared the
performance of IR and green light PPG and found that the green
light achieved higher accuracy of pulse rate detection than did
the IR light [20], [21].
When the heart pumps blood to the body and the lungs during systole, the amount of blood that reaches the capillaries in
the skin surface increases, resulting in more light absorption.

Variation in light attenuation by tissue (modified from [23]).

The blood then travels back to the heart through the venous
network, leading to a decrease of blood volume in the capillaries and less light absorption. The measured PPG waveform,
therefore, comprises a pulsatile (often called “ac”) physiological waveform that reflects cardiac synchronous changes in the
blood volume with each heartbeat, which is superimposed on
a much larger slowly varying quasi-static (“dc”) baseline (see
Fig. 2). The dc component contains valuable information about
respiration, venous flow, sympathetic nervous system activities, and thermoregulation [13]. PPG has been widely used in
the clinical community and has proven its usefulness not only
for real-time monitoring of various physiological parameters
(i.e., oxygen saturation, heart rate (HR), blood pressure, respiration, and cardiac output), but also for vascular assessment
(i.e., arterial diseases, stiffness, and aging) and autonomic function assessment [i.e., HR variability (HRV)/pulse rate variability
(PRV)]. Recently, Allen presented a thorough review pertaining
to the clinical applications of PPG [13], and this paper will not
attempt to elaborate on that work.
There are two main PPG operational configurations, the transmission and reflection modes, that depend on the geometric
arrangements of the light source and the photodetector. Specifically, in the transmission mode, a tissue sample is placed between the light source and the photodetector, while in the refection mode, the source and detector are placed side by side.
In the transmission mode, the photodetector has to detect the
light transmitted through the tissue, and thus, the measurement
site may be limited to tissues where the transmitted light can
be readily detected, e.g., fingertips and earlobes [33]. However, these measurement sites are more susceptible to environment extremes (i.e., low ambient temperature) and the PPG
sensor may interfere with daily activities. Conceptually, in the
reflection mode, the photodetector measures light that is backscattered or reflected from tissue, bone, and/or blood vessels. An
opaque shield is usually positioned between the optoelectronics
to prevent any direct illumination from the light source to the
photodetector that has not first passed through the tissue. This
configuration enables measurements from virtually any point

SUN AND THAKOR: PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAPHY REVISITED: FROM CONTACT TO NONCONTACT

on the skin surface, including those that may be hard to access
with the transmission mode. Nevertheless, the sensor should be
attached firmly to the skin for an accurate measurement, and
therefore, the measurement site normally requires a flat skin
surface. Webster has written an excellent review of optical sensor technology for PPG and its application in pulse oximetry
monitoring [18].
B. Limitations of PPG
Despite PPG’s wide range of applications, there are several
significant drawbacks that may limit the usefulness and evolution of the conventional PPG: 1)Spot measurement: A PPG
sensor can only monitor the dynamic change of the blood volume at one site/point per probe. Multisensor PPG systems have
been developed to monitor blood volume changes at different
sites simultaneously [34]–[36]. With the emphasis on detecting the right-to-left side physiological differences in clinical
applications, these multisensor systems typically require electronic and optical matching of each PPG sensor as well as high
temporal synchronization and anatomically symmetric wearing locations (e.g., both earlobes, both index fingers, or both
legs) [35]. However, multiple sensing locations significantly
constrain the daily activities of the subject. Moreover, the use of
multiple sensors will make the subject uncomfortable and constrain the feasibility for everyday use. An imaging PPG (IPPG)
technology is, therefore, needed to offer detailed spatial information simultaneously from multiple sites of arbitrary sizes and
locations, thus, allowing the derivation and mapping of physiological parameters, and ultimately, facilitating insights that
would otherwise be difficult or even impossible to obtain from
single-point measurements [37]. 2) Contact measurement: For
accurate measurements, the conventional PPG sensor should
be attached firmly to the skin, which constrains its practicality in situations such as wound diagnostics (burn/ulcer/trauma)
and skin healing evaluation or when free movement is required.
Recent studies have investigated the effect of contact force on
the amplitude and timing of the PPG signal using spring-loaded
conventional PPG probes and have shown that this force must be
carefully controlled to obtain high-quality clinical data from the
signals [38]–[41]. In addition, direct contact can easily cause
discomfort for the subjects during continuous monitoring. To
date, no general standards have been established for clinical or
fundamental PPG measurements of contact pressure. The contact measurement configuration might lead to the deformation
of the arterial wall at the detecting site or even block microcirculation in the capillaries. Therefore, from the perspective of
patient comfort, the conventional PPG technique is not suitable
for ambulatory monitoring. Recent “fixed in the environment”
and “wearable” PPG systems have been introduced to address
this issue and will be discussed in great details in the following
section. Nonetheless, drawbacks still remain regarding the lack
of perfusion information and the accuracy needed for clinical assessments. 3) Motion artifact corruption: PPG is susceptible to
motion-induced signal corruption. It has been clinically demonstrated that motion artifacts may cause errors in pulse oximeters
response [42]. Moreover, its single-spot measurement modality

465

makes motion artifact removal or attenuation one of the most
challenging issues in PPG signal processing. This drawback
partially limits the physiological monitoring capabilities of the
technique in real-world environments, such as homecare, ambulances, and sports performance assessment.
III. WEARABLE AND NONCONTACT PPG
To facilitate long-term recordings and to increase the comfort
of subjects, a great effort has been made to develop wearable
PPG systems [24]–[32], [43]–[51]. Attempts have also been
made for noncontact PPG techniques to overcome the drawback of contact with the skin [52]–[55]. In Table I, we provide
several representative studies of wearable and noncontact PPG
techniques.
Ideally, for long-term recording, the wearable PPG device should not interfere with daily activities and should be
lightweight, robust, low cost, and comfortable to wear, while
still maintaining the quality of the signal under various conditions. Similar to the conventional PPG, the measurement sites
for wearable PPG sensing also target the finger, forehead, wrist,
and ear. Among these different measurement sites, the ear and
finger remain of comparative interest because they have a rich
arterial supply and are relatively easy to affix sensors to (e.g.,
finger-ring and earphone). Several types of wearable PPG sensors are shown in Fig. 3. Over the course of a variety of daily
activities, the motion artifacts could be very complex. To address
this issue, an accelerometer has typically been embedded in the
system to provide motion reference for further artifact removal.
Several research groups have assessed their wearable PPG systems in simulated and real conditions and found comparable
capability in monitoring vital signs, such as HR. It is noteworthy mentioning that the newly launched Apple Watch also
provides HR measurements [32]. Great detail about wearable
PPG systems could be found in reviews of this topic [23], [56].
Shi et al., first introduced a noncontact PPG prototype and
demonstrated its feasibility for physiological monitoring [54].
In this setup, one single-channel IR LED was used as the illumination source and was positioned to illuminate the tissue area at
a changeable angle. A high-speed silicon PIN photodiode was
used to detect the reflected light intensity and was positioned
perpendicular to the tissue surface at a distance of 5 cm. Later,
Hu et al. introduced an opto-physiological model based upon the
Beer–Lambert law [57], [58] to show the relationship between
the light incident on a biological tissue and the light received
after transmission through that tissue [59], [60]. However, in
these pioneering studies, motion artifacts were not carefully account for, and the systems operated in still conditions. Cennini
et al. further expanded on this study, introduced a dual-channel
(blue and IR) noncontact PPG prototype together with a motion artifact reduction technique and proved its feasibility for
the assessment of vital signs from a distance of a few centimeters to several meters [55]. Nonetheless, success in addressing
the issue of contact measurement was achieved with the sacrifice of limited motion range, i.e., tilt and translation of the
hand at ±5ºaround the normal position relative to the detector.
It is generally known that remote sensing approaches are more

vulnerable to motion artifacts than the corresponding sensors in
ordinary contact PPG devices [55], [61]. Moreover, the valuable
blood perfusion information is still missing. Therefore, a remote
imaging technique that overcomes these drawbacks is needed.
Indeed, driven by the desire of remote sensing, as well as the dramatic developments of imaging techniques and achievements in
imaging instrumentation, there has been a resurgence of interest
in PPG in recent years.

(CCD)-based IPPG system and proved its feasibility in assessing local changes of dermal blood volume [9]. Since
then, there has been rapid growth in the literature pertaining to IPPG techniques. In June 2015, using the keywords
“PPG/photoplethysmographic and camera,” we found 51 relevant studies in the Web of Science database. The main part
of this topic review was based on 69 IPPG-related studies [9],
[21], [37], [59], [60], [62]–[125]. A summary of several recent
representative IPPG studies is presented in Table II.

An IPPG system can provide an alternative functional imaging solution to clinical situations, which are currently addressed
via magnetic imaging and LDI. This technique brings new insights by providing hemodynamic imaging and mapping capability. Indeed, IPPG has many similarities with the conventional
PPG because both operate on similar physiological systems and
optical principles. For instance, IPPG also requires a light source
and a photo detector to function, although the capability and the
functionality of both are different. The basic concept of IPPG is

to illuminate the specific tissue with a light source, and then, to
measure the light leaving the tissue with an imaging sensor. A
schematic setup of an IPPG system is shown in Fig. 4.
As a noninvasive imaging technique, IPPG enables remote
large-area sensing and reduces the physical restrictions and
cabling associated with patient monitoring. Specifically, IPPG
avoids the deformation of the arterial wall, which is typically
caused by the compression of spring-loaded clips in the conventional contact PPG finger probes or by varying contact forces in
handheld probes, and therefore, provides more reliable signals
for clinical applications. The use of an imaging sensor provides
additional functionality with respect to a point sensor, particularly, for motion artifact attenuation and region of interest (ROI)
selection, both of which enable a robust and flexible noncontact
PPG system.
B. IPPG Instrumentation
The key part of an IPPG system is the camera, which collects
the reflected or transmitted photons from the skin. The camera’s
characteristics significantly influence the recorded images, and
consequently, the physiological parameters. For instance, observations of measured intensity in conventional contact PPG
sensors indicate that the ac component accounts for only a small
proportion of the total intensity (approximately 1% of the dc
level). Therefore, the camera should have a high sensitivity over
the chosen light source spectral range and the flexibility to select
variable readout speeds and exposure time for different applications. With the advances in semiconductor technology, we have
observed a revolutionary development in IPPG instrumentation.
Based upon the camera characteristics, IPPG systems can be categorized into three groups: high-definition (HD)-camera-based
IPPG systems, consumer-level digital-camera-based IPPG systems and cellphone-based IPPG systems.
1) HD-Camera-Based IPPG System: In the pioneering exploratory studies, a CCD or complimentary metal–oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-chip-based HD camera was utilized as the
imaging sensor (see Table II). A customized light source was
typically coupled with the HD camera. Due to the historical
emphasis of PPG on pulse oximetry monitoring and the need
to sample the relatively deep microvascular tissue bed, a red/IR
wavelength light source was repeatedly introduced in the HD-

camera-based IPPG. To illuminate an area of skin tissue, the
light intensity should be large and relatively uniform. Several arrangements have been proposed. Among them, two light source
configurations have been widely used, namely, the ring-shape
and the LED array. For instance, a dual wavelength array of
LED light source has been adopted for pulse oximetry and HR
measurements [88], [90], while in our previous study, a singlewavelength ringlight was introduced for HR monitoring [73].
Of note, the effect of motion artifact was not carefully addressed
in these pioneering studies, and most of the IPPG systems still
operated in a motionless condition.
2) Consumer-Level Digital-Camera-Based IPPG System:
Recently, several attempts have been made to obtain IPPG signals using simple consumer-level digital cameras with normal
ambient light as the light source. Compared to the HD-camerabased IPPG system, these systems have the advantages of simplicity and low cost. Takano and Ohta initially introduced this
system and proved the feasibility of ambient light as the illumination source in an IPPG system [87]. Using a similar system
configuration, Verkruysse et al. not only obtained plethysmographic signals but also found that, among the three recorded
channels (red, green, and blue), the strongest plethysmographic
signal was in the green channel, which is consistent with the fact
that (oxy-) hemoglobin absorbs green light better than red [85].
In addition, they extended the IPPG application to characterize
vascular skin lesions (e.g., port wine stains). It was soon realized
that a webcam was also capable of extracting IPPG signals. For
instance, Poh et al. were the first to demonstrate the feasibility
of a motion-tolerant webcam-based IPPG system and show the
ability of this approach to monitor the vital signs (i.e., HR) of
multiple subjects simultaneously [80].
Regardless of how successful these systems has been in acquiring physiological parameters, e.g., HR/respiration rate (RR)
and HRV, a number of key questions still remain regarding IPPG
systems that utilize ambient light as the illumination source,
such as the practical issue of how variations in ambient light
intensity could influence the performance of the system during physiological assessment. In one of our recent studies, we
found an independent relationship between the ambient light intensity and the normalized plethysmographic signals [37]. This
suggests that, under various external weather conditions, information contained in the ac component of the IPPG signal is
not corrupted by the changes in ambient light intensity, thus
providing solid support for the ambient-light-based IPPG technique as a method for practical, noncontact physiological assessment with clear applications in several domains, including
telemedicine and homecare. To further verify the robustness
of IPPG under various illumination conditions, further study is
needed to assess its performance using artificial illumination in
the evening condition.
3) Cellphone-Based IPPG System: Driven by the desire
for simple personal healthcare evaluation techniques, research
that moves away from the traditional, sophisticated IPPG system design and toward the everyday environment is becoming
increasingly important. It is worth noting that the great effort
on the cellphone-based IPPG technique has witnessed fruitful
achievements. For instance, Jonathan and Leahy successfully
demonstrated the feasibility of a cellphone-based IPPG tech-

Compared to the conventional contact PPG system, which
presents the plethysmographic waveform in a straightforward
way, the signals captured by IPPG are embedded in a sequence
of raw image frames. To obtain the IPPG signals for further
analysis, several (pre-)processing steps have to be carefully conducted, e.g., ROI selection and tracking, color channel selection,
signal denoising, and physiological signal extraction. To the best
of our knowledge, there is no standard processing procedure for
all IPPG applications. We believe that an ideal procedure for
IPPG signal processing should consider the application as well
as maintain the balance between computational complexity and
efficiency. In this section, we provide a brief review of the various methods for each step. Detailed information on formal
procedures and introductions of the methods is available in the
cited original research articles.
1) Spatial ROI Selection and Tracking: ROI selection and
tracking, which aims to locate and/or adjust the ROI with the
subject’s motion, is an indispensable first step to obtain reliable
IPPG signals. In previous IPPG studies, the subject’s face was
typically used as the ROI for pulse measurement. Therefore, it
is very important to reliably select and track the facial region.
Several approaches have been introduced for ROI selection and
tracking. a) Manual selection: Once the videos of the human
face are recorded, one can manually select the ROI, which typically has a fixed frame size for the whole video [37], [70],

[73], [85], [96]. Although this is convenient for ROI selection,
subjects are typically instructed to remain motionless during the
recording [96]. b) Automatic detection based upon Viola–Jones
(VJ) face detector: Poh et al. later introduced an automated
ROI selection method based upon a face tracker (VJ face detector [129]) to detect faces within the video frames and localize
the ROI for each video frame [75], [80]. Of note, this method
has been trained mainly with frontal-face samples, which may
lead to discontinuous face localization across subsequent video
frames when the face position deviates from the frontal position.
c) Automatic detection based upon speeded-up robust features
(SURF): To further improve the accuracy, Feng et al., introduced an ROI selection method integrating the VJ face detector
and a SURF detector [63]. Interestingly, instead of selecting
the whole face, they selected two ROIs on the cheeks region
(0.12×width by 0.15×height of the facial region detected by
the VJ method) because of its higher SNR compared to other
skin regions on the face. d) Skin/nonskin pixel classification:
More recently, Wang et al., developed a skin/nonskin pixel classification method [97], in which a “tracking-by-detection” with
kernels (CSK) method [130] is utilized for face detection on
various skin types (i.e., light, intermediate, and dark). The CSK
method has been proven superior to others in tracking speed
(hundreds of frames per second) and reliability in side-view
face detection. Conceptually, every pixel of the recorded images can be considered as a discrete reflective PPG sensor. To
extract parallel pulse signals from these spatial-redundant pixels
and to concatenate the same skin pixels, they further introduced
a skin/nonskin pixel classification method based upon the one
class support vector machine technique.
2) Spatial Information Synthesis: According to Wang
et al., [97], once the ROI has been successfully selected for
each frame, there are two alternatives to use the spatially pruned
IPPG pixel sensors. a) Spatial averaging: Verkruysse et al. introduced a spatial ROI averaging approach [85]. Although it
compromises the spatial resolution, this most widely used approach has shown its ability to significantly improve the SNR in
the presence of minor motion artifacts. Of note, when assessing
blood perfusion information, there is a tradeoff in the subwindow size and the spatial resolution of the perfusion. Based upon
previous research results and our previous experience, a range
of 8 − 16 pixels is practically suitable for maintaining the balance between the spatial resolution and SNR [73], [85], [89].
b) Spatial concatenation: To further reduce the effect of motion
residual errors, Wang et al. introduced a spatial concatenation
approach [97]. Briefly, independent pulse signals from the sensors within the ROI are extracted and sorted based upon their
deviations from the mean pulse. Those sensors with similar rank
orders (similar quality of pulse estimation) are concatenated.
Therefore, the pulse signals and noise within the whole ROI
could be further separated.
3) Color Channel Selection: Generally, a digital camera sensor has red, green, and blue (RGB) color channels. As mentioned
previously, the optical absorption of hemoglobin varies across
the light spectrum, and therefore, different approaches have been

1 For cellphone-based IPPG system, which typically employed fingertip as
ROI and operated in a contact fashion, ROI tracking is not needed.

nique in HR assessment [77], [82]. Specifically, in the cellphonebased IPPG system, the embedded digital camera was configured in video imaging mode using the white LED (the flash
light) as the light source (see Fig. 5). The plethysmographic
signal could then be extracted from a color movie of the volunteer’s finger covering both the LED and the camera. Given the
huge population of smartphone users (the number of smartphone
users worldwide reached 1 billion in 2012 [128]), such an application will provide potentially revolutionary approaches for
personal healthcare. It is important to note that in these aforementioned studies, subjects were typically instructed to place
their finger on the camera lens without pressing down with
additional force [67]. More recently, cellphone-based noncontact IPPG applications have been introduced and translated to
commercial products (e.g., Philips Vital signs camera, Cardiio,
What’s My Heart Rate, Cardio Buddy, etc.).
C. Data Preprocessing and IPPG Signal Extraction

470

proposed for color channel selection. a) Green channel: In 2008,
Verkruysse et al., found that in an ambient light condition, the
PPG signals have different relative strengths in the three color
channels of an RGB camera, i.e., although the red and blue channels also contact the pulse signal, the green channel has stronger
pulse amplitude and decreased noise [85]. Since then, several
studies of pulse signal dynamics have employed the green channel [67], [77], [82], [121]. b) RGB channels: Based upon this
finding, Poh et al. proposed a linear combination of RGB channels using independent component analysis (ICA). By maximizing the non-Gaussianity of ICA output components, the linear
combination coefficients could be estimated [75], [80]. Because
pulse signals in different color channels undergo a similar motion modulation, the inclusion of three channels and the ICA
approach could further attenuate the motion artifact and improve the estimation accuracy of pulse signals. Lewandowska
et al. varied this concept and defined three independent linear
combinations of the color channels using principle component
analysis (PCA) [70]. Both methods could be summarized as:
S = c1 R + c2 G + c3 B, where S is the pulse signal. However,
with both blind source separation (BSS) techniques, the component that carries the pulse signal is a priori unknown. de Hann
and Jeanne later introduced a chrominance-based method and
showed that it is superior in SNR and motion robustness [99].
Briefly, they built two orthogonal chrominance signals from
three color channels via linear combination: X and Y . The
variations due to the blood volume changes in the skin will
likely be different in each channel while the motion affects both
chrominance signals identically. Thus ,the pulse signal could be
estimated by S = Xs − αYs , where α = σ(Xs )/σ(Ys ) (σ(Xs )
is the standard deviation of Xs ). c) RGBCO channels: For BSS
methods, such as ICA and PCA, the number of source signals
cannot exceed the number of observations. More recently, McDuff et al. moved a step forward through employing a novel
digital single-lens reflex camera with five color channels [red,
green, blue, cyan, and orange, (RGBCO)] [98]. Considering
that there may be many sources of noise, such a color selection
would allow for more observations, which would provide higher
flexibility in the number of source signals.
4) Denoising: Prior to physiological signal extraction, a filtering step was typically employed to further reduce the noise
effect. Essentially, the pulse rate of a healthy subject falls within
the frequency range of 40–240 beats per minute (bpm). The parts
of the signal that are not in this range can be safely blocked.
Several filter designs have been introduced and successfully
implemented for IPPG signal denoising, including a moving
average filter [75], a band-pass filter [70], [85], an adaptive
band-pass filter [97], and wavelet denoising [108]. Many books
have been written on digital signal processing, and, therefore, a
detailed description of the filter design will not be presented in
this paper.
5) Physiological Signal Extraction: After signal denoising,
there are two approaches for physiological signal extraction.
a) Heuristic methods: McDuff et al., introduced a time-domain
pulse peak detection method [98], [115] based upon local maximum detection in a moving window, e.g., within the moving
window, if the signal maximum is greater than that in the previ-

ous window, the next window will be considered; if the maximum within the window is less than that in the previous window,
then the previous maximum will be selected as a peak and the
process will repeat [98]. However, this method only leverages
the amplitude properties of pulse peaks and ignores the temporal
regularity of pulse waveforms and therefore is more vulnerable
to motion-induced residual noises. Another widely used heuristic method is transferring the pulse signal into frequency domain,
which can straightforwardly provide fundamental physiological
information, such as HR and RR. Considering that a robust
pulse signal is a periodic signal, a dominant frequency peak
corresponding to the HR could be detected within the range of
pulse frequency bands (40–240 bpm). To obtain a potentially
more revealing picture of the temporal localization of a signal’s
spectral components, one can use the joint time–frequency analysis [73], [90]. b) Learning-based methods: More recently, Hsu
et al. introduced a support vector regression technique for pulse
rate detection [109]. Briefly, three frequency-domain features
were initially estimated, including the spectrum amplitude for
the spatially averaged R, G, B channels, the spectrum amplitude for the ICA processed independent components, and the
spectrum amplitude for the chrominance-based pulse signals.
Through multiple feature fusion and support vector regression,
they achieved a relative higher estimation accuracy compared to
the heuristic methods. Based upon an adaptive hidden Markov
model, Fan et al. developed a probabilistic approach named
BayesHeart for HR monitoring [110]. Through multiple comparisons with other state-of-the-art algorithms, they found that
BayesHeart outperformed existing algorithms in both accuracy
and processing speed for noisy, intermittent signals.
V. RECENT ADVANCES IN IPPG
A. Scope of Recent IPPG Activities
Although the research of remote IPPG techniques is relatively
recent, it has rapidly spread from the laboratory to everyday
use. In this section, we will discuss the scope of current IPPG
research activities.
1) System Development: In the past decade, a significant
number of IPPG studies have been published, and different IPPG
systems have been developed for various biomedical and clinical applications (see Table II). In the pioneering exploratory
setups, a major effort has focused on light source design as well
as control circuit development for synchronization between the
light source and the camera. Specifically, the wavelength of
the light source should be suited to the quantum efficiency of
the camera and should maintain good tissue optical properties.
Uniformity is another feature that can verify the effectiveness
of the light source design, and it will influence the evaluation
and interpretation of the perfusion results. The complexity of
the system design has, to some degree, constrained the evolution of IPPG techniques. Recently, several attempts have been
made to develop an ambient-light-based IPPG system as well as
cellphone-based IPPG systems. Such systems, typically coupled

SUN AND THAKOR: PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAPHY REVISITED: FROM CONTACT TO NONCONTACT

with a simple light source (ambient light or embedded flash light
in cellphones), soon attract intensive research interest. Actually,
we could observe a shift in research interest from a sophisticated
IPPG system to plain and portable IPPG setups.
It is also noteworthy that Estepp et al. introduced another
possible solution to further mitigate the unavoidable motion
artifacts. Briefly, they developed a multiimager array, which
includes nine synchronized digital cameras coupling with ten
full-spectrum bulbs [105], [107]. Through increasing the dimensionality of the imager channel space prior to the BSS, they
achieved satisfactory HR readings compared to the motionless
fingertip references, showing a promising trend for the development and transition of IPPG for everyday use.
2) Data Processing: Along with system development, the
IPPG signal processing technique has evolved dramatically. 1)
Motion artifact attenuation: Given its remote monitoring configuration, IPPG lacks resistance to motion-induced signal corruption. Researchers from different groups have proposed various motion attenuation methods, such as image registration [73],
spatial averaging [85], a radiance model [63], ROI tracking [63],
[75], [80], [97], and BSS [70], [73], [75], [80]. Through utilizing
one or a combination would significantly enhance the accuracy
of the physiological assessments. 2) Signal processing: Fourier
transformation is widely applied in the conventional PPG/IPPG
signal processing because it can provide fundamental physiological information, such as HR and RR (the peak frequency
at certain spectrum regions). However, it assumes that signals
are in a steady state when physiological signals are transient
in nature. To obtain a potentially more revealing picture of the
temporal localization of a signal’s spectral components, several time–frequency analysis methods have been successfully
adopted for IPPG signal processing [73], [85], [90]. In addition,
Kamshilin et al. have introduced a patent pending method for
monitoring blood perfusion [76]. This method shows a great
advantage in the high resolution visualization of the blood pulsative flow using video recordings, which may provide supportive cardiovascular information to assist in the diagnosis of
various diseases related to blood perfusion. More recently, several learning-based physiological extraction methods have been
developed and proven to be superior in their processing speed
and estimation accuracy [109], [110]. 3) Application area extension: The various biomedical/clinical applications of IPPG
have been extensively researched. As a substitute for the conventional contact PPG techniques, IPPG will be able to assess
almost all the physiological measurements that contact PPG currently provides. Among them, heart/respiration rate and blood
perfusion were the first attempts to evaluate the feasibility of the
IPPG technique. With recent developments in signal processing,
current IPPG systems normally can provide multiple physiological parameters with a single recording. Several recent achievements and applications of IPPG techniques are recounted in the
following section. 4) Physiological signal visualization: Based
upon Eulerian video magnification, an important study by Wu
et al., introduced a novel visualization technique for real-time
detection of physiological signals in videos of human subjects
with ambient light [126]. Through detecting and magnifying the
subtle color variations (0.5 intensity units in an 8-bit scale) of hu-

471

man skin due to blood flow, HR could be reliably extracted from
a standard RGB video. Of particular note, this study inspired
many new applications of IPPG, e.g., vital signs monitoring in
the neonatal ICU. Details of this method and its implementation
in detecting vital signs could be found in [127].
B. Progress of IPPG Applications
In this section, some typical applications of IPPG are drawn
from the selected studies (see Table II). Of note, the applications
listed here may not cover all aspects of current IPPG applications; however, they provide some insights into the progress of
IPPG applications. More importantly, the applications of IPPG
discussed in this study are not intended to diagnose, monitor,
alleviate, prevent, or treat any medical/clinical conditions or
diseases.
1) Heart/Respiration Rate: The heart and respiration rate
are simple yet clinically important physiological measurements.
They are routine assessments in a wide range of clinical settings,
i.e., hospital-based and ambulatory patient monitoring. As seen
in Table II, HR and RR were successfully assessed via different IPPG system setups. Particularly, the achievement of the
cellphone-based IPPG technique has already attracted significant attention. Considering that the current lifestyle is also a
mobile lifestyle [131], it is possible to introduce mobile healthcare, which we believe will lead to a more healthy lifestyle in the
near future. In addition, cellphone-based healthcare technology
could easily extend beyond simply monitoring and measuring
and could also be used to relay information to medical professionals. It is noteworthy that one smartphone app, “Instant
Heart Rate” has attracted more than 25-million customers since
2010 [132]. In June 2015, using key words “heart rate monitor,”
we found 173 relevant apps in the App store.
2) Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO2): The same principle,
utilized in contact pulse oximetry sensors, i.e., that hemoglobin
(Hb) and oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) have different absorption coefficients in the red and IR range, could be employed for remote
blood oxygen saturation measurements using IPPG. In 2005,
Wieringa et al. first introduced the idea of contactless imaging
of arterial oxygen saturation distribution within tissue (SpO2
camera) [89]. In that feasibility study, HR and RR were successfully extracted from plethysmographic signals simultaneously
recorded at three wavelengths (λ = 660, 810, and 940 nm),
therefore, indicating the potential of IPPG for noncontact SpO2
assessment. Immediately after this study, Humphreys et al. presented a transmission IPPG system and proved the practicality
of IPPG in appraising SpO2 [88], [133]. The ability to remotely
assess SpO2 information could benefit research areas such as
intensive care and sleep studies. Of note, an HD camera coupled
with a customized light source was employed in these pioneering
studies. Scully et al. later showed that multiple physiological parameters, including SpO2, could be assessed using a cellphone
with certain calibrations [67]. More recently, the embedded app
“S Health” in the Sumsung Galaxy S6 also demonstrated the
capacity to monitor SpO2 [134].

3) PRV: Fluctuations in the interval between heartbeats, attributed to continuous changes in the sympathetic parasympathetic balance of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), are a
sign of healthy cardiac function and a valuable tool for investigating the neural control of the heart. The quantification
of these fluctuations to determine HRV has proven its effectiveness in various research and clinical studies (for a review,
see [135] and[136]). A number of recent studies have shown that
the functional characteristics of PRV are comparable to those of
HRV [137]–[139], where the former can be easily acquired from
PPG. Recently, Poh et al. introduced a remote PRV assessment
technique based on a webcam IPPG system [75]. This feasibility study was further supported by one of our recent studies,
which verified the reliability of IPPG in PRV assessments [64].
Furthermore, recent advances in hardware development have
provided a sufficient initial sample rate (including, but not limited to, the iPhone 6: 1080p HD at 60 ft/s; the Samsung Galaxy
S6: 1080p HD at 60 ft/s; the LG G4: 1080p HD at 30 ft/s; and the
HTC One M9: 1080p at 60 ft/s) for further investigation of the
feasibility of smart-phone based PRV assessment. More importantly, the necessity for an interpolation approach when a low
sample frequency IPPG system is employed for assessing PRV
information has been addressed [64]. The last two decades have
witnessed the recognition of a significant relationship between
the ANS and cardiovascular mortality, including sudden cardiac
death. One study of 763 elderly subjects reported on the relationship between HRV measurements and all-cause mortality
during a four-year follow-up period [140]. However, the normal
HRV standards for various age and gender subsets are still missing, and larger prospective population studies with longitudinal
follow up are needed [141]. Such studies may be significantly
facilitated by IPPG technology.
4) Blood Perfusion: Compared to the conventional PPG
techniques, IPPG holds a significant advantage in offering detailed spatial information from multiple sites simultaneously,
thus allowing the derivation and mapping of physiological parameters. Verkruysse et al. demonstrated the capability of IPPG
in the characterization of vascular skin lesions (e.g., port wine
stains, a syndrome of cutaneous capillary malformations) [85].
Other areas that stand to benefit from blood perfusion monitoring are skin damage assessment and healing evaluation. For
instance, high perfusion corresponds to superficial dermal damage that may require only clinical dressing and conservative
management, while low perfusion areas might require surgical
treatment [142]. Hulsbusch and Blazek demonstrated the practicability of IPPG for wound assessment [90] and the evaluation
of allergic skin reactions and antihistamines inhibition [92].
More recently, Aarts et al. demonstrated, for the first time, the
feasibility of IPPG in the neonatal intensive care unit for vital
sign monitoring [93]. Interestingly, they found that PPG signal
amplitudes in Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome affected
skin were larger than in the unaffected skin area. In addition,
Kamshilin et al. introduced a novel method for extracting high
spatial resolution photoplethysmographic images [76]. Based
on the lock-in amplification of the recorded video frames, the
method could achieve a resolution of 1 × 1 pixel. A better understanding of hemodynamics is of great interest to improve the

diagnosis of various vascular malformations and skin damage
as well as to evaluate the therapeutic outcomes, which could be
easily achieved via an IPPG technique.
5) Pulse Transit Time/Pulse Wave Velocity: The assessment
of arterial stiffness is clinically important due to its strong
connection with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [143],
[144]. An objective assessment of vascular aging could also provide valuable information about hypertension, which is a risk
factor for stroke and heart disease [145]. From the available
methods to assess arterial stiffness, pulse wave velocity (PWV)
has emerged as the gold standard because of its relative ease
in determination and perceived reliability. Pulse transit time
(PTT), the time it takes a pulse wave to travel between arterial
sites, is inversely related to the PWV [146] and is more convenient to obtain. Several feasibility studies have proven the effectiveness of the conventional contact PPG techniques in assessing PTT information [147]–[149]. Recently, Anchan reported
some preliminary results of PWV information extracted from a
cellphone-based IPPG system [91]. Shao et al. later presented a
digital-camera-based PTT estimation method through measuring the time delay between the simultaneously recorded pulse
signals from the mouth area and the palm area [116]. However,
a number of key questions still remain in these interesting studies. For instance, as a time-domain estimation, PTT measurements need a relatively fast sample frequency for accurate timedomain resolution (i.e., > 200 Hz). The sample rate for a mobile
phone camera could only reach approximately 30 ft/s and less
than 80 ft/s for the digital camera in [116], which makes the results less convincing. The obtained PWV measurements, therefore, required further verification against the standard readings.
6) Blood Pressure: For people suffering from chronic cardiovascular diseases, blood pressure is one of the most important
pieces of information for doctors to conduct a diagnosis. The
traditional noninvasive digital blood pressure assessment system typically includes an inflatable cuff, a signal processing
unit, a controller, and a display. Although generally successful,
several key drawbacks limit its use in certain clinical situations,
e.g., continuous blood pressure measurement [150]. With recent advances in remote sensing, it has been realized that blood
pressure could be assessed in a “cuff-less” manner [150]–[153].
Most recently, Huang et al. developed a blood pressure transport theory for noninvasively monitoring systolic and diastolic
blood pressures (SBPs and DBPs). Through simple calibration,
this method could be implemented with any IPPG systems (e.g.,
smartphone-based IPPG) for blood pressure assessment [106].
Compared to the commercial Omron sphygmomanometer, this
method achieved satisfactory levels of accuracy in determining both SBPs and DBPs based upon the standards (mean
< ±5 mmHg, S.D. <8 mmHg) set by the Association for the
Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. We believe that this
method move a step forward for blood pressure monitoring.
7) Atrial Fibrillation: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most
commonly sustained arrhythmia and affects approximately
5-million Americans [154]. Its strong association with an increased risk for heart failure and stroke makes it an important clinical indicator [155]. However, compared to the wellestablished treatment strategies, accurate AF detection and

SUN AND THAKOR: PHOTOPLETHYSMOGRAPHY REVISITED: FROM CONTACT TO NONCONTACT

monitoring are still major challenges for clinicians and researchers due to its paroxysmal nature, particularly in the early
stages [156]. The gold-standard diagnostic test for AF is electrocardiogram (ECG). Several recent studies have shown that more
frequent monitoring can improve AF detection [157]. Given
that ECG recording is burdensome and costly, a more effective
paroxysmal AF detection technique that is readily accessible,
inexpensive, and simple to operate is needed to increase the
frequency of monitoring [158]. Most recently, McManus et al.
introduced a cellphone-based real-time AF detection technique
and assessed its performance in distinguishing an irregular pulse
from AF using pulse waveforms obtained during a normal sinus rhythm [100]–[102]. Considering the prevalent nature of
smartphones and acceptance by the general public for monitoring their health, we think that this technique could lead to
better acceptance and more widespread use of out-of-hospital
arrhythmia detection.
8) Systolic and Diastolic Peaks: The pulse shape characteristics can provide valuable diagnostic information about the
cardiovascular system [159]. For instance, independent studies
have shown that the point of inflection [the time delay between
the systolic and diastolic peaks (see Fig. 2)] decreases in older
individuals and in those with various cardiovascular diseases as
a consequence of increased large artery stiffness and increased
PWV of pressure waves in the aorta and large arteries [160]–
[162]. Based upon a PPG waveform recorded from a finger,
Millasseau et al. introduced an objective index (units m/s) to
assess artery stiffness, which is calculated from the body height
divided by the time delay between the systolic and diastolic
peaks [160]. Of note, to achieve better estimation accuracy, a
high sampling frequency is typically needed (i.e., >100 Hz).
More recently, McDuff et al. showed that the pulse waveform
morphology (e.g., systolic and diastolic peaks) can be reliably
and accurately recovered through integrating IPPG technique
with advanced signal processing methods, thence providing new
insights into arterial stiffness assessment [115].
VI. PROSPECTIVE OF IPPG RESEARCH
A. Standardized System Design for Clinical Applications
Eventually, the effectiveness and usefulness of IPPG technology will need to be verified with clinical applications. As a
recently introduced technique, the IPPG system design lacks an
established standard, which is an area that requires additional
effort. Among those existing IPPG setups, some adopt ambient light as the light source. Though convenient and successful
in some physiological assessments, ambient light is arguably
not recommended for clinical applications. For instance, unstable light intensity during the recording would pose a significant engineering issue and even prevent successful measurements [93]. To become a clinically mature technique, several
aspects of IPPG deserve attention: 1) The selection of optimum
wavelengths is a matter of importance in the design of IPPGs
for clinical applications, e.g., a minimum of two wavelengths
together with a light source control circuit are necessary for the
acquisition of the oxygen saturation information. 2) More sophisticated light source designs should be employed to achieve
the high uniformity of the light source while maintaining light

473

intensity. This approach will significantly improve the measurement accuracy of blood perfusion. 3) Integration with other
imaging technologies could provide more comprehensive physiological assessments. In our recent study, we developed a multimodal imaging technique that includes an IPPG system and
a laser speckle contrast imaging system [163]. In an animal
model, we demonstrated its usefulness in real-time monitoring
of the cortical cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen.
B. Engineering Model
The quantification of the optical propagation in tissue is a
question of growing concern for biomedical and clinical applications. Optical biomonitoring modalities can be described in
general terms as systems that modify a specific light intensity,
where the transfer function of the system is determined by a
number of anatomical and physiological parameters. Compared
to the major research activities in the application area extension, only a few studies have been published pertaining to an
efficient opto-physiological model of the IPPG technique [60],
[164]. Considering the complexity of the interaction of light
with biological tissues and the geometry differences of skin
tissue at various anatomical regions, the slow development of
the modeling is understandable. A proper opto-physiological
model requires information on the light propagation in the skin
related to the optical properties of the individual skin layers.
This involves a solution for the radiation transfer function in
a multilayer skin model that represents skin geometry, as well
as experimental methods to determine the optical properties
of each skin layer [165]. The Monte Carlo radiation transport
techniques, which are based on the stochastic nature of radiation interactions, provide a practical solution for the radiation
transfer function [164].
Another possible and complementary route to build an efficient opto-physiological model is through interpreting experimental results. Most recently, based upon observations of IPPG
experiments, Kamshilin et al. introduced a new model in which
pulse oscillations of the arterial transmural pressure deform the
connective-tissue components of the dermis. These deformations may include changes in the orientation or structure of
the connective tissue. Consequently, elastic deformations of the
dermis will result in variations of the back-reflected light intensity due to both local changes in scattering and the absorption
coefficient of the light [104].
We believe that with a better understanding of the existing
engineering model for the conventional contact PPG [166], an
increasing availability and accuracy of tissue optical properties in the literature [167] and the use of numerical solutions of
light propagation in human tissue, an optimal opto-physiological
model for IPPG could be achieved. Such a model would also
provide new insights for revealing the origins of different components of the PPG signal.
C. Personal Health Assistant and Telemedicine
Telemedicine involves the delivery of healthcare and related information over long distances by combining biomedical
signals with information technology and means of communication [168]. Due to rapid developments in information tech-

474

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 63, NO. 3, MARCH 2016

nology, the last decade has witnessed the advent of mobile
telemedicine, in which physiological assessments are delivered anytime from anywhere via the latest generation of smartphones. The measured physiological parameters can be sent
to a remote healthcare server through wireless communication network for further clinical diagnosis. Recently introduced
smartphone-based IPPG systems are revolutionizing the efficiency and convenience of personal healthcare with simple system requirements (without additional hardware setup) and the
capability to simultaneously monitor multiple vital signs (see
Table II). Moreover, taking into consideration the increasing
needs of the aging society for medical assistance, the emerging
field of the low-cost IPPG systems seems to be a promising solution to enable elderly people to monitor their health conditions
on a daily basis independently. With advancements in hardware,
e.g., on-board computing capability, large memories, large touch
screens, and open operating systems, a multifunctionality and
compact ubiquitous personal health monitoring system would
be feasible and would dramatically accelerate the promotion of
the preventive healthcare model.

VII. SUMMARY
This review has introduced the nascent technique of IPPG
and has demonstrated its great potential for use in a wide range
of clinical assessments, such as homecare, telemedicine, and
personal healthcare. The emerging field of IPPG has offered
some of the first quantitative insights into an effective and comprehensive interpretation of remote physiological assessments
and has significantly contributed to the resurgence of research
interest in PPG techniques. We started with a brief introduction
of the conventional contact PPG technique, its principles of implementation and its limitations. From a biomedical engineering
research perspective, we surveyed a large body of the literature
pertaining to IPPG, tried our best to cover those most representative IPPG studies, provided insights into the fundamental
basis of IPPG techniques, and highlighted important considerations for its various applications. We hope that this paper will
help those who are interested in using or developing IPPG techniques. While obstacles to developing a clinically useful IPPG
device remain, the allure of remote physiological assessments
and the desire for personal healthcare are strong. As a rapidly
expanding field, the development of IPPG is continuously growing and evolving to embrace new technologies. We believe that
the extensive acceptance of IPPG is irresistibly happening and
will dramatically change our lifestyle in the near future.
