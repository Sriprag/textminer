Abstract—Sleepiness and fatigue can reach particularly high
levels during long-haul overnight flights. Under these conditions,
voluntary or even involuntary sleep periods may occur, increasing the risk of accidents. The aim of this study was to assess the
performance of an in-flight automatic detection system of lowvigilance states using a single electroencephalogram channel. Fourteen healthy pilots voluntarily wore a miniaturized brain electrical
activity recording device during long-haul flights (10 ± 2.0 h, Atlantic 2 and Falcon 50 M, French naval aviation). No subject was
disturbed by the equipment. Seven pilots experienced at least a
period of voluntary (26.8 ± 8.0 min, n = 4) or involuntary sleep
(N1 sleep stage, 26.6 ± 18.7 s, n = 7) during the flight. Automatic classification (wake/sleep) by the algorithm was made for
10-s epochs (O1-M2 or C3-M2 channel), based on comparison of
means to detect changes in α, β, and θ relative power, or ratio
[(α + θ)/β], or fuzzy logic fusion (α, β). Pertinence and prognostic of the algorithm were determined using epoch-by-epoch comparison with visual-scoring (two blinded readers, AASM rules).
The best concordance between automatic detection and visualscoring was observed within the O1-M2 channel, using the ratio
[(α + θ)/β] (98.3 ± 4.1% of good detection, K = 0.94 ± 0.07,
with a 0.04 ± 0.04 false positive rate and a 0.87 ± 0.10 true
positive rate). Our results confirm the efficiency of a miniaturized
single electroencephalographic channel recording device, associated with an automatic detection algorithm, in order to detect
low-vigilance states during real flights.

I. INTRODUCTION
ITHIN air operations, low states of vigilance are the
main human factor implicated in fatal accidents [1].
Fatigue, which is induced by increasing duration of duty, and
sleepiness modulated by the time previously spent awake and
by circadian rhythmicity can both impair vigilance [1]–[3].
In-flight fatigue occurs in about 20% of medium-haul flights
and 40% of long-haul flights [2]. Moreover, between 41%
and 54% of the pilots reported that “fatigue severely impairs flight security, at least once” during their carrier [1].
In particular, long-haul flights requiring pilots and aircrews
to be alert during the circadian low of vigilance (2–6 A.M.)
are particularly at risk [4]–[6].
Fatigue and sleepiness sometimes reach so elevated levels that involuntary sleep periods are also observed during flights [4]. Even in the U.S. Air Force, half of the
pilots admitted having felt asleep at least once during a
mission [7]. Actually, despite the efforts made for fatigue
and alertness management programs, pilots still remain concerned by fatigue and sleepiness. Detecting pilot’s involuntary sleep periods has become a challenging objective to
further improve flight safety.
To confirm the prevalence of low states of vigilance during
flights, polysomnographic recordings have been conducted in
various studies [3], [6], [8]. Although numerous physiological indicators (ocular movements, heart rate, activity/rest periods, etc . . . ) have been recorded to evaluate the level of vigilance, the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal has been considered as the most sensitive, predictive, and reliable [9]–[11].
It has been observed that performance decrement was associated with a decrease in the level of vigilance, represented
by an increase in theta (θ) and alpha (α) bands activity [12]–
[14], in contrast with a decrease in beta (β) band activity from
the EEG power spectra [15]. During the transition period from
wake to sleep, these changes are predominant in the posterior
regions of the brain (i.e., cortical, parietal, and occipital scalp
localization) [6], [16]–[18].
Recently, different works have shown the pertinence of using
a single EEG channel for visual scoring of sleep stages [19],
automatic classification of sleep stages [20], and automatic detection of driver’s drowsiness [16].
The aim of this study was to assess the performance of an
algorithm for automatic detection of low states of vigilance
based on recordings obtained from a single EEG channel during
real long-haul flights and to compare algorithm results from
occipital and cortical channels.

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Subjects
Fourteen healthy voluntary pilots (aged 33.2 ± 7.2 years, all
men) from the maritime patrol squadrons (Lann Bihoue French
naval aviation) were enrolled in the study through local advertising. They were previously administered the Epworth sleepiness
questionnaire (ESS), a French version of the sleep disorders
questionnaire (SDQ-FV) [21], and interviewed about their medical history, sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness. Subjects had
to be devoid of any significant medical event, to have a good
sleep quality and a normal Epworth sleepiness score (<10), and
not to present any night symptom. All the subjects signed an informed consent before being included in this experiment, which
respected the principle of the Declaration of Helsinki (1975,
revised in 2000).
B. Protocol
The study was carried out during 15 operational real flights
of more than 8 h (Breguet Atlantic 2 or Dassault Falcon 50
marine aircrafts), with take-off and landing at Lann Bihoué
military airport (France, International Civil Aviation organization code: LFRH). Recordings were carried out mainly during
overnight flights.
After preflight briefing, 30 min before the flight, electrodes
and recording devices were installed by a medic for each pilot.
The quality of the signal was visually checked after a 2 min
recording period (1 min with opened eyes and 1 min with closed
eyes), using a software developed on MATLAB. This period was
considered as an awake and artifact free period and was then
used as a reference period. Data were recorded continuously
for each subject from before take-off to after landing, while
they performed their regular activities. Recording devices were
removed after landing and data were stored and transferred to be
analyzed. Subjective sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale,
KSS) and device tolerance were assessed after the flight using a
questionnaire. Subjects were also asked to report sleep periods
that occurred during the flight.
C. Recordings
A miniaturized multichannel ambulatory recording device
(Actiwave, CamNtech Ltd England) was used to collect two
EEG derivations (C3-M2 and O1-M2) and a transversal EOG
channel (E1-M2 and E2-M2) [19]. Bioelectrical signals were
digitized at a sampling frequency of 200 Hz with a 16 bit
quantization between −500 and 500 μV, within a bandwidth of
0–48 Hz. All the data were stored into computer files using
the standard .EDF data format. EEG cup-electrodes (Ag-AgCl)
were attached onto the scalp of the subjects (EC2 electrode
cream, Grass Technologies, An Astro-Med, West Warwick,
USA), according to the international 10–20 system for electrodes placement. Auto-adhesive electrodes (Neuroline 720,
Ambu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark) were used for EOG recordings. The recording device was fixed on the pilots’ head using
EC2. This method was adapted to headphone wearing and to
decrease the length of the cables.

D. Automatic Analysis
The EEG power spectrum was used to detect offline bursts
in EEG activity, for each EEG channel and then, to estimate if
the pilot was sleepy or not (awake) using a personnel MATLAB
script, using EEGLAB software [22]. The analysis and classification algorithm used in our study has already been described
elsewhere [16], [23]. In brief, the automatic procedure included
three steps (see Fig. 1): artifacts rejection, analysis, and classification. For all steps, the fixed reference period was the first
60 s of the recording, i.e., before the flight, during which subject
was asked to say seated, quiet and awake with the eyes opened.
We controlled using a KSS scale that he was not sleepy at the
beginning of the recording (KSS < 5).
1) Step 1: Artifact Rejection: Artifacts periods were detected using a variance comparison between a 10-s moving
window (s2i ) compared to the 60-s fix reference window (s2ref ),
using a Fisher bilateral test (1) [24]. The threshold for assuming
the presence of artifact (F1 -λart/2 < F < F1 -λart/2 ) was set to
λart = 2 [24].

2) Step 2: Analysis: First, the nonfiltered EEG signal was
computed using a short time fourier transform (STFT) every 2 s (50% overlap) by the Welch periodograms method
(Hamming windows) [25]. The spectral power was calculated
for each following frequency: θ (4–8 Hz), α (8–12 Hz), and
β (16–26 Hz). Then, the relative power (i.e., αrel , βrel , and θrel )
for each band was calculated as a ratio of the total EEG spectral power (EEGp ower ). Then, in order to smooth the αrel , βrel
and θrel signals and to reject abnormal values, the energy was
filtered every second using a median filter in a sliding window.
The ratio (α + θ)/β was also calculated from filtered values.
3) Step 3: Classification: Comparisons of means [16] were
computed for the αrel , βrel and θrel bands in order to compare
the mean relative power of moving windows (Mi, 30 periods of
1 s) with the mean relative power of the fix reference window
(Mref , 60 periods of 1 s) using a bilateral Student T-test.
The test was performed with the variable Ui , which followed
a centered reduced normal law:
M̄i − M̄ref
.
Ui = 

(2)

The means equality was then tested (-U1 -λ/2 < U < U1 -λ/2 )
with a confidence threshold λ fixed at 2 for each EEG channel
[12], [16], [23]. When the normalized value of relative power
was greater (for αrel and θrel ), or less than the threshold (for
βrel ), then the condition was considered as a “sleepy” state. Otherwise, the condition was considered as “awake”. This method
did not need any training or testing dataset. The threshold was
set automatically from the fixed window’s mean relative power.
The test was computed on the relative power signals calculated
every second (i.e., 30-s windows, with a 29-s overlap). The
same method was used for the ratio (α + θ)/β with threshold λ
fixed at 4.

Third, for each second window, αrel and βrel were merged
using a fuzzy logic fusion, which is based on the theory of
fuzzy sets [26]. For that, μDr(αrel ) and μDr(βrel ) were defined
as membership functions (3), which represented the membership degree of αrel and -βrel (independently considered), to
the “sleepy” state using the equation with a = −5, b = −1.5,
a = 1.5, and b = 5 [12], [23].

The final decision Dr(αrel , βrel) was made using the following (4):
μDr (αrel )μDr (βrel )
.
μDr (αrel )μDr (βrel ) + μAw (αrel )μAw (βrel )
(4)
In this equation, μAw (x) was the membership function of
the “awake” state and was the complementary of μDr (x) [i.e.,
μAw (x) = 1 – μDr (x)]. This denominator was used to normalize
Dr(αβ rel , βrel) between 0 and 1. If the denominator is zero, the
value of Dr(αrel , βrel) is set to 0.5. The pilot was considered as
“sleepy” if Dr(αrel , βrel) was larger than 0.5 [12].
The overlapping algorithm generated an elementary decision
every second for each analyzed frequency band. A simple majority vote, among 300 consecutive tests on elementary outputs
scores, ensured a final scoring resolution comparable to the one
from the experts. If during the 300-s interval, the system classified at least 156 times as “sleepy,” then the decision for the
epoch was “sleepy.” Else, “awake” was applied. In addition to
temporal flexibility, this decisional layer was supposed to compensate for the effect of abrupt changes in successive classifier
outputs [27].

E. Statistical Analysis
1) Interexpert Reliability: A comparison between the two
experts was made for each subject. Epoch-by-epoch agree-

ment was defined as the epoch percentage that was assigned
to the same state between the two experts. A Kappa (κ) test
was computed to study the level of agreement [28], and corrected for the probability of agreement due to hazard. Interpretation was made using Landis and Koch levels: κ > 0.80
(Agreement), 0.60 < κ ≤ 0.80 (Good), 0.41 < κ ≤ 0.60 (Reasonable), 0.21 < κ ≤ 0.60 (Poor), κ ≤ 0.20 (Bad) [28].
2) Algorithm Versus Expert Scoring Comparison: The
method proposed in this paper provided a binary decision
(“awake”; “sleepy”) while the database was analyzed using five
levels (Awake, NonREM stage 1, 2, 3 [N1, N2, N3] and REM
sleep). Moreover, the expert classified nonoverlapping intervals
of 30 s (epoch) while the automatic system made a decision
every second. To compare the results obtained with the expert’s visual consensual decision, the five decision levels used
by the experts were converted into a binary decision (“awake”
or “sleepy” if any sleep stage N1, N2, N3, or REM was observed). Furthermore, each 30-s epoch classified by the experts
was directly compared to the system automatic decision.
The performance level of the algorithm was compared with
the results obtained by the two experts (consensual sleep stage
scoring) in order to determine the possible use of a single EEG
channel for automatic analysis [20]. Epochs were then compared one by one and classified according to a contingency table. The true positive rate (TPrate), reflecting the sensitivity of
the method and corresponding to the ratio between the number
of “sleepy” expert decisions and the number of true “sleepy”
automatic decisions (TP), was calculated. The false positive
rate (FPrate) was considered as the ratio between the number
of “awake” expert decisions and the number of false “sleepy”
automatic decisions (FP). FPrate was equal to 1 – specificity
[29]. The results were displayed as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, plotting TPrate in a function of FPrate.
The purpose was to obtain the highest TPrate with the lowest
FPrate [29]. Then, accuracy of the classifier was evaluated by
the assessment of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) plotting
TPrate in function of FPrate for 1000 different λ values (from
−50 to 50) [30], [31].
Finally, the percentage of good classification was determined
as the percentage of epochs that were assigned to the same
state between the automatic algorithm and the consensual visual
classification from the two experts. The quality of this agreement

kappa (κ) test [28]. In the end, the mean global κ and standard
error were calculated for each power band and compared using
a nonparametric Wilcoxon test. The level of significance was
fixed with p < 0.05.
III. RESULTS
One recording could not be interpreted (electrode default).
Low vigilance states were detected in a dataset of 14 long-haul
flights (10 ± 2.0 h) representing 168 h of flight (Table I). The
sleep stage classifications, as well as the comparisons between
scorers and algorithm, have been computed based on a total of
20 160 epochs (30 s). The agreement between the 2 scorers was
97.2% (κ = 0.83) and qualified as “Agreement.”
A. Hypovigilance States During Flights
Involuntary sleep periods (31.7 ± 17.2 s) were observed in
seven subjects. This represented a cumulative duration of 221 s
of sleep (Table I). These sleep periods occurred between 00:30
and 03:00 (n = 5) and between 14:00 and 15:30 (n = 2). Furthermore, four of these subjects reported having also slept voluntarily (26.8 ± 8.0 min) during the flight. All these voluntary naps were observed during the last hour of the flight (8 h
of flight). No difference between KSS scores recorded before
(2.6 ± 0.9 points) and after the flight (3.2 ± 1.7 points) was
observed. Only one pilot had a KSS score > 7 after the flight,
considered as “sleepiness.”
B. Tolerance
One subject reported to be disrupted by the system, in particular by the auto-adhesive EOG electrodes, which induced
a local irritation. Another subject recognized that the system
was not comfortable enough and disagreed to wear it another
time if asked. However, the system did not decrease opera-

C. Automatic Classification
FPrate (1 – specificity) and TPrate values, percentage of true
classifications, Kappa agreement, and AUC values for each of
the five methods of comparison were reported in Table III.
Using the O1-M2 channel, the best FPrate was observed using θ, (α + θ)/β ratio and fuzzy fusion methods (i.e., between
0.02 and 0.04). FPrate was upper (5%) for α and β indices.
The best TPrate was observed using β, ratio and fuzzy fusion
(i.e., between 0.87 to 0.92). Moreover, using β, (α + θ)/β ratio
and fuzzy fusion, the percentage of good classification (sensitivity) was > 90, κ > 0.80, and AUC > 0.9 which confirmed the
agreement between the automatic classification and the experts
scoring and the accuracy of the classifier. Using C3-M2, the lowest FPrate was observed using θ and (α + θ)/β ratio, whereas
it was upper (1%) for α, β, and fuzzy fusion. The best TPrate
and percentage of good classification were observed using β,
(α + θ)/β ratio and fuzzy fusion. However, a correct agreement
(κ > 0.80) between the automatic classification and the visual
scoring was observed, only by using the (α + θ)/β ratio method.
The TPrate (see Fig. 2), the percentage of good classification,
AUC, and κ were all higher for the (α + θ)/β ratio method
using the O1-M2 channel than the C3-M2 channel (p < 0.05).
No significant differences were observed for the other methods.
IV. DISCUSSION
This study is the first using a miniaturized single EEG channel
recording device, associated to an automatic algorithm, in order to detect low-vigilance states during real flights. Our device
provided highly reliable low-vigilance states detection when
confronted versus visual experts scoring (i.e., 98% of good classification). Best results between lowest FPrate, highest TPrate,
and agreement level were observed using the ratio (α + θ)/β.
The O1-M2 channel provided the best classification, using a
detection threshold that was completely independent and which
did not need to be tuned for each subject.
A. Low-Vigilance States During Flights
Half of the subjects recorded in this study involuntarily felt
asleep during the flight. These periods seem to be mainly related

to the level of sleepiness as they were observed during the
circadian periods of low vigilance (i.e., 01:00–05:00 and 14:00–
15:00). This high rate of involuntary sleep during long-haul
flights was previously observed during civilian flights [3], [6],
[8], [32].
Four of the subjects that experienced involuntary sleep also
had a voluntary nap after 8 h on duty. These results confirmed
that mental fatigue and sleepiness may rise to unacceptably high
levels during air operations as a result of relatively long duty
periods that may coincide with the lowering of alertness and the
disruption of the circadian rhythmicity [6].
B. Tolerance
The system developed and used in this study induced very few
secondary effects. Despite the long duty-time (i.e., >8 h) most

of the pilots felt comfortable with the device. Our results are not
easily comparable to other studies because tolerance is never
or rarely evaluated, in particular in ecological situations. Based
on EEG measurements, some authors used portable devices
(i.e., baseball cap) with dry electrodes for real time alertness
(79.1% of good classification) and drowsiness (90.9% good
classification) detection [33]. However, the efficiency of these
systems has not been evaluated in-flight, in particular regarding
the consequences of nonprecise electrodes location [33].
Using noninvasive measurements such as actigraphy, similar
results considering classification have been reported [6]. In a
previous study, we also have shown a significant relationship
between vigilance impairment and changes in heart rate or heart
rate variability, during a 2 h 30 min recovery period following a multileg 4 h cross country flight [34]. Nevertheless, the

SAUVET et al.: IN-FLIGHT AUTOMATIC DETECTION OF VIGILANCE STATES USING A SINGLE EEG CHANNEL

resolution of these systems worn like a watch or a chest belt
is low and it was not possible to detect sleep periods lasting
less than 5 min [3], [8]. Actually, the decision provided by our
algorithm is only delayed by 20 s from the signal acquisition
(5 s due to the sliding window of 10 s for median filtering, and
15 s induced by the sliding window of 30 s used for MCT).
Other vigilance monitoring systems, based on eye movements
detection [35], heart rate variability changes [29], or even on vehicle characteristics [36]–[38], have been proposed, in particular
for drivers. Systems based on vehicle characteristics measuring
parameters such as time to line-crossing, lateral position have
very good practicality but poor extendibility as additional devices have to be connected to the vehicle, which raises integrity
and liability issues [10]. Moreover, none reliable device measuring aircraft characteristics has been proposed as an index of
low-vigilance states at present.

C. Automatic Classification
As for the position of the EEG electrodes, better results were
observed using O1-M2 than C3-M2. Indeed, all brain regions
did not exhibit the same EEG patterns during the transition from
wake to sleep. As previously observed, low-vigilance states were
characterized by more important changes in sites closer to the
midline (e.g., F4, C4, P4, O2) than in sites located more laterally
(e.g., Fp2, F8, T4) [17]. In this study, no frontal channel was
used because of the incompatibility with headphone wearing
onboard. Nevertheless, low-vigilance states are well characterized by changes in EEG activity, in the posterior region of the
brain [16]. More precisely, as confirmed by our results, occipital derivations are the most efficient for low-vigilance states
detection [17].
As for the algorithm formula, the correct classification of
low-vigilance states using the automatic detection based on a
single EEG channel, in comparison with experts’ scoring is
particularly high (more than 90% and κ > 0.80). This kind of
automatic classification can be compared to the automatic classification of two sleep stages (wake/sleepy) based on a fuzzy-logic
method (Cz-Pz, Oz-Pz) previously used in laboratory [20], or
for drivers [16]. Such a high accuracy of classification has also
been observed with devices using more EEG channels and a
sophisticated offline signal processing [10], [33], [39]–[41].
Various studies indicated the crucial role of α waves during mental fatigue or drowsiness episodes [11], [42], especially
in the occipital cortex [43]. Systems for drowsiness detection,
validated versus drivers performance (line-crossing, vehicle deviations, lack of steering corrections, etc.), showed a high agreement with changes in α power [10], [12], [16], [38], even by
using a single EEG channel [16]. The algorithm based exclusively on α relative power did not allow acceptable detection
levels in our study. However, as previously observed for drivers,
the ratio (α + θ)/β was the best indicator for low-vigilance states
detection [44], [45]. An increase in α and θ activity accompanied by a decrease of the brain activity in the β band has already
been associated to vigilance level impairment [16], [38], and
also to performance decrement during simulated and real flights
[38], [46].

2845

The main concern with detecting α or θ changes in the EEG
signal is the difficulty to adjust the algorithm to each subject
characteristics because of large interindividual differences [16].
Most of the previous works used algorithms which needed customized thresholds and frequency band-widths, in particular
concerning α, in order to increase the algorithm performance
because each subject exhibit different patterns [47], [48]. However, the main challenge of our study was to find a common
algorithm that works for all subjects. Here, only the levels of
α, β, and θ relative power in the “awake” state are learned for
each pilot from the reference window at the beginning. During
the following recording, the output of MCT is a variable which
follows a centered reduced normal law and the threshold used
in the bilateral test has statistical meaning and is the same for all
pilots. Picot et al. [12], [16] demonstrated that this method is not
sensitive to threshold value changes and individuals differences.
In this study, the algorithm classification has been compared
to hypovigilance occurrences but not to pilot’s performances
and errors which is not possible to set up during real operational
flights. Various studies have shown changes in α waveforms with
mental fatigue and also in association with driving errors [11] or
sleepiness [12], [16]. Futures directions of our works should be
to develop online hypovigilance during simulated flights, and
altered performance prediction. In particular, changes in alpha
power band activity, burst, and nonlinear chaotic analysis of
EEG changes, could be pertinent to predict pilots performance,
as observed in driving protocols [11], [49], [50].
V. CONCLUSION
Preventing accidents in aviation caused by low-vigilance
states has become a major focus of safety. The (α + θ)/β ratio, in particular from the O1-M2 EEG channel, offers the best
compromise between high TPrate and low FPrate compared
to experts scoring. The simplicity of the method proposed in
this study (i.e., a single EEG channel, no customization of the
algorithm) and its temporal resolution suggest its potential application for online automatic detection of low-vigilance states
during real flights.
