Epsilon-Tube Filtering: Reduction of
High-Amplitude Motion Artifacts From
Impedance Plethysmography Signal
Sardar Ansari, Member, IEEE, Kevin Ward, and Kayvan Najarian, Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—The impedance plethysmography (IP) has long been
used to monitor respiration. The IP signal is also suitable for
portable monitoring of respiration due to its simplicity. However,
this signal is very susceptible to motion artifact (MA). As a result, MA reduction is an indispensable part of portable acquisition
of the IP signal. Often, the amplitude of the MA is much larger
than the amplitude of the respiratory component in the IP signal.
This study proposes a novel filtering method to remove the highamplitude MA’s from the IP signal. The proposed method combines
the idea of ε-tube loss function and an autoregressive exogenous
model to estimate the MA while leaving the periodic respiratory
component of the IP signal intact. Also, a regularization method is
used to find the best filter coefficients that maximize the regularity
of the output signal. The results indicate that the proposed method
can effectively remove the MA, outperforming the popular MA reduction methods. Several different performance measures are used
for the comparison and the differences are found to be statistically
significant.
Index Terms—Autoregressive exogenous model, epsilon-tube,
impedance plethysmography, motion artifact reduction, portable
monitoring of respiration.

I. INTRODUCTION
OTION artifact (MA) reduction is one of the most challenging problems encountered during filtering and processing of physiological signals, especially those that are collected using portable monitoring devices. The main difficulty
in dealing with MA is its dynamic nature and the fact that the
amplitude of such artifacts is often much larger than the amplitude of the signal of interest. The previous studies that address
this problem can be broadly divided into three groups. The first
group is focused on instrumentation. The aim of these studies
is to provide alternative instruments for signal recording, such
as electrodes, sensors, or wires, as well as different electrode

placements that are less susceptible to MA [1], [2]. Such improvements are outside the scope of this paper.
The second group uses independent component analysis
(ICA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to estimate the
MA as an independent source of variation in the signal [3]–[6].
The goal of ICA is to estimate the set of linear coefficients
through which the signal of interest and the MA have been
mixed. It requires multichannel recordings of the signal which
are often available for the electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalography signals. However, the IP signal is typically
measured through a single channel recording. The multichannel
recording of the IP signal will require excessive instrumentation
and hardware which is not desirable when designing a portable
device. Therefore, ICA is not an appropriate candidate for MA
reduction from the IP signal here. Another disadvantage of using ICA is that the assumption of linear mixing process is not
guaranteed to hold.
The third group of MA reduction methods uses adaptive filters to estimate the MA. Different varieties of adaptive filters
have been applied to this problem including least mean squares
(LMS) [7]–[9], recursive least squares (RLS), [10], [11], normalized LMS (NLMS) [12], and normalized signed regressor
LMS [13]. Despite the popularity of adaptive filters, there is a
disadvantage associated with them. Adaptive filters tend to not
only model the MA, but they can also adapt to the signal of interest. In particular, the MA in the IP signal is similar in shape and
frequency bandwidth to the respiratory component of the signal.
Therefore, an adaptive filter that successfully models the MA
will also model the respiratory component in the calm (not contaminated by MA) sections of the signal. This is due to the fact
that adaptive filters do not have a mechanism to distinguish between the MA and the component of interest when they are similar. However, the ε-tube filtering method that is proposed in this
paper focuses only on the MA and is not affected by the semisinusoidal pattern of the respiratory component of the IP signal.
The proposed filtering method is applied to the IP signal to
eliminate the MA. The main component of this signal is highly
correlated with respiration which has a regular periodic pattern
with an amplitude that is almost constant within a short window
of time. The amplitude of the interfering MA is often larger
than the amplitude of the respiratory component. Therefore,
the proposed filtering method can be applied to this signal to
remove the MA. The end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2 ) signal is used as the
reference signal in this study to compare the filter output to the
actual respiration waveform. The EtCO2 signal is considered the
gold standard in monitoring the respiration. In order to show that

the ε-tube filtering, in fact, has a better performance compared
to the currently existing methods, it is compared to the ICA
algorithm, and the RLS and NLMS filtering methods in the
results section.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Next
section will introduce the IP signal and the respiratory rate. Section III introduces the proposed filtering method. The regularization term is discussed in Section IV, and the gradients of the
objective function and the constrains are derived in Section V.
The nonrecursive version of the gradients for fast computing
are presented in Section VI. Finally, Section IX discusses the
conclusions and the future work.

II. IMPEDANCE PLETHYSMOGRAPHY
AND RESPIRATORY RATE
Measuring electrical impedance of different segments of the
body, a.k.a. IP, has been widely used in different fields of
medicine for decades. Examples of applications of plethysmography in medicine are measuring lung volume, blood volume
variations, blood flow, muscle contraction, eye movement, autonomic nervous system activity, and activity of brain cells [14].
Plethysmography is performed by injecting a high-frequency
low-amplitude sinusoidal current into the segment of interest
using a pair of skin electrodes (current electrodes) and measuring the imposed voltage difference between the injection points
using another pair of skin electrodes (voltage electrodes) [15].
Electrical resistance of the tissue of interest is then calculated
using the injected current and the measured voltage difference
between the electrodes, which is caused by the passage of current through the tissue. The result is the IP signal, whose main
component is highly correlated with respiration [16], [17]. The
respiratory signal and the respiratory rate could be easily extracted from the IP signal acquired from the thorax and abdomen
area when the subject is motionless. However, motion is another
main source of blood volume variation. Motion can create drastic variations in the measured IP signal [18]–[22], resulting in
artifacts whose amplitudes are much larger than the amplitude
of the respiratory component in many cases [23]. As a result, it
is necessary to use filtering methods to eliminate MA’s before
the signal can be used to monitor respiration. The IP signals
used in this study are measured on the subject’s back between
the third and tenth ribs. This setting has been used instead of the
traditional transthoracic electrode placement, since it is suitable
for portable acquisition of the IP signal.
III. ε-TUBE AND AUTOREGRESSIVE EXOGENOUS MODELS
The idea of using ε-tube along with the tangent sigmoid (TS)
activation functions (AF) was first introduced in our previous
paper [24]. However, the TS functions have a predetermined and
rigid structure that prevents it from modeling complex MA’s effectively. In particular, the derivative of the TS function does
not change sign. Therefore, a new TS function is required every time the derivative of the MA changes sign. Instead, we
use an autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model here in order
to increase the flexibility of the model. The concept of ε-tube
was first introduced in the context of support vector machines

and support vector regression in the form of Vapnik’s loss function [25]. Unlike the conventional Euclidean norms, Vapnik’s
loss function allows for a margin, called the tube, where the
error that is assigned to the points that fall inside the tube is
zero. In mathematical terms,
|gt − yt (U, w)|ε = max(0, |gt − yt (U, w)| − ε)

where gt is the value of the signal at time t, yt is the output of the
filter at t, U is a matrix whose rows are the accelerometer signals,
w is the vector of filter coefficients, and ε is the width of the
tube. In other words, the points for which the distance between
the model output and the target value is less than ε (points that
fall within the tube) will be assigned a zero error. Moreover, the
error increases in a linear fashion outside the tube. Therefore,
the ε-tube filtering seems to be a natural fit for removing MA’s
with high amplitude from periodic signals. The assumptions
made here are that the amplitude of the periodic signal does not
change rapidly in a short period of time and that the signal has
a regular recurring pattern. For example, the main component
of the IP signal is respiration which is periodic with an almost
constant amplitude within short windows of time. Therefore,
ε-tube can be used to estimate the MA while it refrains from
modeling the respiratory component of the signal by forming a
tube around it that only encompasses the respiratory component.
The ε-tube filter is formulated as a constrained optimization
problem which can be expressed as

(5)

yt (U, w) − gt ≤ ε +
ζt ≥ 0,

ζt ≥ 0,

where ζt and ζt are slack variables and N is the length of the
signal.
In our previous work, yt (U, w) was a combination of TS
functions that modeled the MA. However, the TS functions are
too rigid and are not flexible enough to model complex MA’s.
As a result, an ARX model is used in this paper enabling the
filter to model MA’s with generic shapes. The ARX model is
defined as

where na , the number of poles, and nb , the number of zeros plus
1, are design parameters. Also, ai is the ith feedback coefficient,
ut is the vector of accelerometer readings at time t (the column
of U associated with t), and bi is the corresponding vector
of the ith feedforward coefficients. Hence, the vector w in (1)
is composed of ai ’s and the elements of bi ’s. Therefore, the
problem reduces to finding the vector w that minimizes (2)
subject to (3), (4), and (5). The solution to this optimization
problem is unique only if the signal of interest is exactly periodic
with a constant amplitude and a regular pattern, and the MA is

generated through an ARX process. However, none of these
assumptions hold in reality; thus, the optimal solution is not
unique. Instead, there is a set of filter coefficients all of which
minimize the objective function in (2). This set includes the
coefficients by which the MA has been generated. Fig. 1(a)
shows an IP signal that is corrupted by MA. The same signal is
shown in Fig. 1(b) after it was filtered using ε-tube as defined
by (2)–(6). The filtered signal has an error of zero; thus, it
is an optimal solution to the optimization problem. However,
it does not resemble the shape of the respiratory component
and contains some high-frequency noise. As a result, a second
criterion is needed to choose the solution that is most likely to
be the generator of the MA. Assuming that the IP signal follows
a regular pattern, we use regularity of the signal as the second
objective to maximize:
Minimize f =

where R(s, U, w) is a regularization term, discussed in the next
section, and c is a design parameter which adjusts the balance
between the two objectives. The parameter c should be typically
set to a small enough value so that the regularization term acts
as a secondary objective, ensuring that we are searching for the
solution with the most regular pattern among the ones that have
the smallest error. The regularization term is discussed in the
next section.
IV. REGULARIZATION
As discussed in the previous section, one needs to use a regularity measure to choose the ARX coefficients, among the

ones that minimize the Vapnik norm, that lead to the most
regular results. It is worth noting that the notion of regularity
discussed here is different from the regularization in statistics
and machine learning. Here, a regular signal is one that has a
constant recurring pattern and regularity is the quantity which
measures this characteristic. Consequently, a regular signal has
a frequency composition that is invariant as time progresses.
One way to measure this property is to use Stockwell transform
(S-transform) [26]. S-transform is a generalization of short time
Fourier transform and provides a time–frequency representation
of the signal that is sensitive to irregularities in the signal. Fig. 2
shows an example of the magnitude of the S-transform of an
IP signal that contains irregularities after it was filtered using
the ε-tube without regularization. An ideal signal with a regular
pattern would have a S-transform for which the frequency decompositions along the frequency axis for any two given points
on the time axis are identical. Hence, the average correlation between the vertical slices of the S-transform in Fig. 2 can be used
as a measure for the regularity of the signal. It is noteworthy that
several other regularization terms were investigated in this study,
e.g., several measures were extracted from the Fourier transform
of the signal, including variance, kurtosis, and entropy, as well
as several features extracted from the Wavelet transformation of
the signal. However, S-transform proved to be the most sensitive
to the irregularities in the signal. Therefore, it has been used in
this study.

Stockwell [27] proposes a Shift theorem for the continuous

case.

Assume that the S-transform of y[kT ] is Syp,n , i.e.,

goal of this filter is to maintain the respiratory component of the
signal and not the heart rate. All in all, the proposed filter is able
to successfully recover the IP signal that is contaminated by MA.
In order to find the optimal solution to (7) subject to (3)–(5),
one needs to compute the gradients of the objective function
and the constraints. These gradients are computed in the next

log of the magnitude of a complex number is differentiable.
The results of filtering the IP signal in Fig. 1(a) using the ε-tube
method and the regularization term in (14) are shown in Fig. 1(c).
The proposed filtering method is successful in removing the
MA and recovering the respiratory component of the signal.
Regularization leads the optimization process toward the right
filter coefficients and successfully removes the irregularities in
the signal. The S-transform of the filtered signal is free of the
high-frequency noise that was present in Fig. 2. The vertical
slices of the S-transform (the frequency components at different
times) are correlated. The low-amplitude variations on top of the
IP signal that correspond to the heart rate are deteriorated after
filtering in Fig. 1(c). The discontinuity in the horizontal band at
f = 1.3 Hz in Fig. 3 is caused by this deterioration. However, the

derivatives of (3) and (4) with regards to al and bl can be
recursively calculated using (15) and (16). Moreover, the partial
derivatives of (3) with respect to ζt and ζt are −1 and 0, respectively. Likewise, the partial derivatives of (4) is 0 with respect
to ζt and −1 with respect to ζt . The partial derivatives of (5) are
trivial.

of the partial derivatives with respect to al and bl . It will be

Each row of the matrix C can be obtained by rotating the previous row by one element to the right. Therefore, C is a circulant
matrix. As a result, (35) can be expressed as a convolution between the first column of C, denoted by c and y,
c ∗ y = d.

(36)

Applying Fourier transform to both sides, we obtain
F {c ∗ y} = F {d} ⇒ F {c} · F {y} = F {d} .

Note that the division is element-wise. The vector c is treated
(32) as a signal when the Fourier transform is being computed. This

all of its partial derivatives.
The recursive equations introduced in this section are suitable
for real-time filtering of the IP signal. There are cases when the
process takes place in batch mode. Recursive equations will
be very inefficient in such applications. Hence, nonrecursive
versions of the same equations are derived in the next section
for batch processing.

when c is treated as a signal. The two representations of c, as
a column vector and as a signal, are mathematically equivalent.

VI. IMPLEMENTATION
Previous section introduced recursive equations to compute
yt , ∂∂a l yt , ∂ ∂b h yt , Syp,n , ∂∂a l Syp,n , and ∂ ∂b h Syp,n . Recursive equal

tions are desirable in adaptive filters. However, evaluating these
equations is inefficient in nonadaptive settings. Therefore, nonrecursive versions of the same equations are introduced in this
section. The new equations, which are based on Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform, can be evaluated more
efficiently. The input signals are assumed to be circular, i.e.,
yt+k N = yt for integer k’s.
Let us define the matrix C and vectors y and d as follows:

inverse Fourier transform of the result. Fourier transform of a
signal and its inverse can be found very efficiently using the
fast Fourier transform algorithm. On the other hand, using (6)
to compute yt involves an iterative procedure which can be very
inefficient. The empirical observations indicate that computing
yt using (42) is on average 12.6 times faster than using (6).
The derivative of yt with respect to al can be found in a
similar manner. The recursive equation for ∂∂a l yt , (15), can be
written as
∂

(43)
C

where ∂∂a l y is a vector composed of the derivatives of yt with
respect to al , and y−l is the vector of y values after a shift of
size −l, namely, yt−l . Therefore, ∂∂a l y can be found by taking
the same steps as in (35)–(38), as follows:

All of the derived nonrecursive equations involve linear combinations of the filter coefficients, vector and matrix multiplications, element-wise multiplications and divisions, and inverse
Fourier transform. Modern computers can efficiently perform all
of these operations. On the other hand, the recursive equations
derived in the previous section are much more time consuming. In particular, the iterative equations can only be executed
sequentially while the operations that are involved in the nonrecursive equations can be computed in parallel mode. Depending
on the framework and application, one might choose to either
use the recursive equations or the nonrecursive ones.

VII. EXPERIMENTS AND DATA
The experiments that are presented in this study were conducted using a Biopac MP150 system, equipped with a Biopac
EBI100C to measure the IP signal and a Biopac CO2100C to
measure the EtCO2 signal. All the signals were collected at
250 Hz and were later down-sampled to 10 Hz for processing
purposes. The collected IP signals were filtered using a Butterworth bandpass filter with cutoff frequencies of 0.001 and 2 Hz.
A three-axis accelerometer sensor was used to capture the subject’s movements. The module was placed on the subject’s right
arm and the signals were transferred to the Biopac machine and
stored on a laptop. This setting was used because the movements
of the arm capture most of the movements that can induce MA
into the signal. However, choosing the optimal setting for the
electrodes and the accelerometer sensors is outside the scope of
this paper and requires further investigation. The accelerometer
signals were bandpass filtered using a Butterworth filter with
cutoff frequencies of 0.05 and 2 Hz. A sample of the data that
is contaminated with MA is shown in Fig. 4.
The plethysmograph’s electrodes were placed on the subject’s
back between serratus posterior superior and serratus posterior
inferior muscles. Similarly, voltage electrodes were placed on
the back right beside the current electrodes along the path between them. Fig. 5 shows the placements of the electrodes.
Two experiments were conducted to assess the performance
of the proposed ε-tube filtering method. The first experiment
was performed to compare the proposed method to the ICA
algorithm. The FastICA package, which maximizes the nonGaussianity, was used in this study. For this experiment, the
data were collected from six subjects. The subjects performed
a total of 272 maneuvers in 280.6 min (72.0 min of the signals
were contaminated by MA). The ICA algorithm requires at
least two readings of the IP signal from two different sights.
The traditional transthoracic electrode placement was used as
the second channel of the IP signal. The second experiment
was conducted to compare the proposed method to the RLS and
NLMS filtering methods. Thirteen subjects participated in this
experiment where a total of 501 maneuvers were performed by
the subjects in 589.5 min, where 143.9 min of the signals were
contaminated by MA.

Fig. 5.

Placements of electrodes.

TABLE I
MANEUVERS THAT WERE PERFORMED IN THE EXPERIMENTS

Subjects were asked to perform several maneuvers to imitate transient and periodic movements in both experiments. The
experimented maneuvers are described in Table I. Maneuvers
1–9 are transient movements while maneuvers 10–14 are periodic. Each maneuver was performed roughly three times by
each subject, except maneuvers 13 and 14 which were each performed once. All the maneuvers except 7 and 8, 13 and 14 were
performed while the subject was sitting on a chair.
After removing the MA’s, the respiratory rate is extracted
from both the filtered IP and the EtCO2 signals. To do so, the
S-transform of the signal is computed and the most dominant
frequency component between 0 and 2 Hz is considered to be
the respiratory rate at each time t. The S-transform is computed
within a sliding window which is 30 s long and a step length
of 10 s. The respiratory rate is extracted from 10 s of the signal
in the middle of the window. Also, a threshold on the amplitude
of the signal is used to detect whether the subject is breathing
or not. The extracted respiratory rates from the IP and EtCO2
signals are then compared to assess the performance of the proposed filtering method. No postprocessing has been performed
prior to the respiratory rate extraction.

VIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This section presents the results of comparing the respiratory rates extracted from the filtered IP signal and the EtCO2
(reference) signal using two criteria, the error and the correlation, where the error is defined as the amount of discrepancy
between the respiratory rates in breaths per minute (BPM). The
filter parameters are selected using subject-wise cross validation, i.e., the signals for one of the subjects is used as the test
data while the rest of the subjects are used to find the optimal
parameters in each fold. The criterion used for selecting the optimal parameters is the mean error. The filter orders for ε-tube
were na = 1 and nb = 6 in all the folds, and c = 20 in nine
and c = 10 in four folds. For the NLMS filter, the selected filter
order is 35 in all the folds, the step size is 0.1 in nine folds
and 0.05 in the others, and the leakage is 0.93 in six folds and
0.95 for the others. The selected filter orders and forgetting factors for the RLS filters are five and 0.99 in all the folds, respectively. For the ICA algorithm, cross validation selects the tangent
hyperbolic AF with a1 = 10 in tanh(a1 u) in five folds and the
Gaussian AF’s with a2 = 5 and a2 = 10 in u exp(−a2 u2 /2) for
the remaining two folds. The RLS and NLMS filters are chosen as the representatives of the family of adaptive filters since
they are the most commonly used filtering methods in different
signal processing applications, including MA reduction.
The results of MA reduction using ε-TF, NLMS, RLS, and
ICA from a sample of maneuver five are shown in Fig. 6. The
amplitude of the filtered IP signal in Fig. 6(b) is within the
imposed tube. On the other hand, the NLMS, RLS, and ICA
methods, as shown in Figs. 6(f) and (g) do not guarantee that
the amplitude of the filtered signal is within the acceptable range
of amplitudes for the IP signal. Furthermore, none of the methods except ε-TF are able to successfully recover the respiratory

that ε-TF outperforms NLMS and RLS in all the maneuvers.

component of the signal. Hence, the proposed method seems to
outperform the existing methods. The proposed filter and ICA
are compared in Table II using several different performance
measures. A similar comparison between the proposed ε-TF,
NLMS, and RLS filters is shown in Table III. The first performance measure that is used, Corr, is the Pearson correlation
coefficient between the filtered IP signal and the EtCO2 signal,
which measures how much the morphological features of the
two signals agree in the time domain. The error between the
extracted respiratory rates is also used to compute several performance measures. The first measure, Exact, is the proportion
of the times when the extracted respiratory rate from the IP and
EtCO2 signals are equal. Moreover, Dev1 and Dev3 are the proportions of the times when the average error is less than 1 and 3
BPM, respectively. Finally, Mean Err and Max Err are the mean
and maximum error between the respiratory rates extracted from
the filtered IP signal and the EtCO2 signal, respectively.
Figs. 7 and 8 show the comparison between the proposed and
the conventional methods for different maneuvers using correlation. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other methods with no exceptions. Moreover, Figs. 9 and 10
show a similar comparison using mean error. Again, the performance of the proposed method is superior to the other methods
in all the maneuvers. As a result, we can conclude that the proposed method is more successful in removing the MA compared
to ICA, NLMS, and RLS. The statistical significance of the differences are tested using Tukey’s honestly significant difference
(HSD) for NLMS and RLS and using two-sample t-tests for ICA.
The Box–Cox transform is successfully applied to the response

variables to improve the normality and homogeneity of the variances. The analysis includes subject and replication[subject]
(replication nested within subject) as random effects, and filtering method as a fixed effect. It is performed separately for each
maneuver.
The statistical tests indicate that most of the differences in
Figs. 7–10 are statistically significant. Tables IV and V show
the results of the statistical analysis. The results indicate that 33
of the tests on correlations and 36 of the tests on mean errors out
of the total of 42 tests that have been conducted in each case are
significant. Similar results are obtained using pair-wise t-tests
and Bonferroni’s correction, except for the difference between
the mean errors of ε-tube and RLS which becomes significant
when pair-wise t-test is used. As a result, we can conclude that
the proposed method outperforms the existing method and the
differences between this method and the existing methods are
statistically significant.
All in all, the results indicate that the proposed method is
superior compared to ICA, NLMS, and RLS.
IX. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS

The ε-tube filter proposed in this study is a novel approach
for removing high-amplitude MA’s from the IP signal with a
regular pattern. The only assumption that is made is that the
amplitude of the signal of interest does not change rapidly during
a short period of time. An ARX model is used to relate the input
accelerometer signals to the filter output which is an estimate of
the MA. A ε-tube is used to measure the estimation error. This
allows for modeling the MA while refraining from modeling the
signal of interest. In order to choose the best filter coefficients
among those that minimize the estimation error, a regularization
term is introduced to maximize the regularity of the output
signal. The results show that the ε-tube filter with regularization
can effectively reduce the MA in the IP signal. In particular,
the proposed method outperforms ICA, NLMS, and RLS in
all the maneuvers that were performed in the experiments. The
statistical tests indicate that the differences between ε-TF and
the conventional methods are statistically significant in most of

416

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. 19, NO. 2, MARCH 2015

the cases. Hence, the proposed method is more successful in
removing the MA from the IP signal than ICA, NLMS, and
RLS.
One of the future works of this study is to evaluate the performance of ε-tube filter in removing MA’s from other physiological signals, such as ECG and PPG. Moreover, the proposed
method should be compared to other existing MA reduction
methods. The adaptive version of the same filter will also be
developed to be used in real-time applications.
