Abstract—Goal: We tested the hypothesis that the ballistocardiogram (BCG) waveform could yield a viable proximal timing
reference for measuring pulse transit time (PTT). Methods: From
15 healthy volunteers, we measured PTT as the time interval between BCG and a noninvasively measured finger blood pressure
(BP) waveform. To evaluate the efficacy of the BCG-based PTT
in estimating BP, we likewise measured pulse arrival time (PAT)
using the electrocardiogram (ECG) as proximal timing reference
and compared their correlations to BP. Results: BCG-based PTT
was correlated with BP reasonably well: the mean correlation coefficient (r) was 0.62 for diastolic (DP), 0.65 for mean (MP), and 0.66
for systolic (SP) pressures when the intersecting tangent method
was used as distal timing reference. Comparing four distal timing
references (intersecting tangent, maximum second derivative, diastolic minimum, and systolic maximum), PTT exhibited the best
correlation with BP when the systolic maximum method was used
(mean r value was 0.66 for DP, 0.67 for MP, and 0.70 for SP).
PTT was more strongly correlated with DP than PAT regardless
of the distal timing reference: mean r value was 0.62 versus 0.51
(p = 0.07) for intersecting tangent, 0.54 versus 0.49 (p = 0.17)
for maximum second derivative, 0.58 versus 0.52 (p = 0.37) for
diastolic minimum, and 0.66 versus 0.60 (p = 0.10) for systolic
maximum methods. The difference between PTT and PAT in estimating DP was significant (p = 0.01) when the r values associated
with all the distal timing references were compared altogether.
However, PAT appeared to outperform PTT in estimating SP
(p = 0.31 when the r values associated with all the distal timing
references were compared altogether). Conclusion: We conclude
that BCG is an adequate proximal timing reference in deriving
PTT, and that BCG-based PTT may be superior to ECG-based
PAT in estimating DP. Significance: PTT with BCG as proximal
timing reference has potential to enable convenient and ubiquitous
cuffless BP monitoring.

I. INTRODUCTION
ULSE TRANSIT TIME (PTT) is the time interval required
for a pressure wave to travel between two sites (typically
between a proximal site and a distal site) in the arterial tree. It
has attracted a vast amount of interest due to its potential for
convenient and ubiquitous blood pressure (BP) monitoring: in
contrast to currently widespread BP measurement techniques
such as auscultation [1] and oscillometry [2], which can only
provide intermittent BP measurement due to requisite interventions (i.e., cuff inflation/deflation), PTT may enable cuffless
beat-to-beat BP monitoring. In fact, there is a large volume of
research effort that has been made in PTT-based BP monitoring
(see, for example, recent reviews on this topic [3], [4]).
The majority of PTT measurement techniques reported to
date employ the electrocardiogram (ECG) as proximal timing
reference by virtue of its convenience and robustness to motion
artifacts (see, e.g., some recent work on BP monitoring based on
ECG as proximal timing reference for measuring PTT [5]–[9]).
In the literature, the time interval between ECG and a distal arterial waveform is referred to as pulse arrival time (PAT) rather
than PTT: PAT consists of pre-ejection period (PEP: the time
interval corresponding to the isovolumetric contraction of the
heart) in addition to PTT. While PTT is closely related to BP via
arterial compliance (i.e., if arterial BP increases, arterial wall
tension increases, then PTT decreases due to a decrease in arterial compliance as dictated by the wave equation [10]), PEP is
affected by several factors such as myocardial contractility and
afterload (see, e.g., [11], [12]). Therefore, the relation between
BP and PAT is affected by PEP as well as PTT. Thus, the correlation between BP and PAT is likely to be deteriorated unless
PEP and PTT consistently respond to a perturbation in BP. In
the literature, PAT has been shown to correlate very well with
BP (especially SP [13]). However, PAT has often shown poor
correlation with DP when the “foot” of distal arterial waveform
was used as distal timing reference [14]–[16], perhaps partly
due to the adverse influence of PEP.
The ballistocardiogram (BCG) is a measurement of the reaction forces of the body to cardiac ejection of blood into the
aorta. As such, it may represent a true proximal timing reference
for PTT. The BCG signal has been studied for a long time: the
BCG phenomenon was first discovered in the late 1800s [17]
then pioneered in the early 1900s [18] and studied heavily in
the mid-1900s [19]. However, by the late 1960s, with the introduction of medical imaging technologies, BCG began to wane

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Human Subject Study and Waveform Acquisition

Fig. 1. Overview of the methodology used in this study to measure PTT using
the BCG as a proximal timing reference, and to correlate PTT to BP measured at
the finger. Two perturbations were used to vary BP by modulating intrathoracic
pressure (P th o r ) and cardiac output (CO) in order to assess the correlation
between PTT and BP under varying physiologic states.

and has since been completely removed from clinical practice
[20]. Recently, there has been a resurgence of BCG research
internationally, mainly due to the convenience with which it
can be measured outside of clinical settings. Researchers have
demonstrated convenient and inexpensive options for BCG instrumentation such as a weighing scale [21], chair [22], bed [23],
or with wearable sensors [24]. With these instruments, BCG has
been shown to be capable of trending changes in cardiac output
[25] and myocardial contractility [26]. On the contrary, it has
not yet been rigorously explored for measuring PTT and, accordingly, estimating BP. Since BCG is a measurement of body
movements associated with the mechanical ejection of blood
from the heart, and since the time interval between ECG and
BCG has been shown to be strongly correlated to PEP [27], we
posit that BCG represents an opportunity to obtain a convenient
and accurate proximal timing reference for measuring PTT.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that BCG waveform
could be a viable proximal timing reference for measuring PTT
(see Fig. 1). From 15 healthy volunteers, we measured PTT as
the time interval between BCG and a noninvasively measured
finger BP waveform. To evaluate the efficacy of the BCG-based
PTT in estimating BP, we likewise measured PAT using the
ECG as proximal timing reference and compared their correlations to BP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
intensive investigation to study the efficacy of BCG for the purpose of measuring PTT and estimating BP. We report our initial
findings on how closely BCG-based PTT is correlated with BP,
how the correlation between PTT and BP varies with respect to
distal timing references, and how PTT compares with PAT in
estimating BP.

Fifteen young and healthy volunteers without any history of
hypertension or cardiovascular disease (age: 24 ± 3 years; gender: ten males and five females; weight: 70 ± 12 kg; height:
175 ± 10 cm) were enrolled in our study, which was approved
by the Georgia Institute of Technology Institutional Review
Board. Upon providing written consent, standard gel electrodes
(Ag/AgCl) were placed on each subject for modified Lead II
ECG acquisition using a wireless amplifier (BN-EL50, Biopac
Systems, Goleta, CA, USA). For BCG acquisition, a customized
weighing scale was built as described in a previous study [21].
For BP acquisition, a finger-cuff continuous noninvasive BP
waveform sensor was placed on the middle finger of the subject
(ccNexfin, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). The sensors were
interfaced to a computer via a data acquisition unit (MP150,
Biopac Systems, Goleta, CA). The data were collected at 1-kHz
sampling rate. The data acquisition schematic is presented in
Fig. 2(a). Each subject, while wearing all sensors, stood on the
scale, and the experimental protocol was started [see Fig. 2(b)].
First, the subject stood still for 60 s for a baseline recording. Second, the subject was asked to breathe deeply and slowly. Third,
the subject was asked to perform a sustained hand grip challenge
in which the subject performed an isometric contraction against
a fixed resistance with the contralateral hand to the one outfitted
with the sensors. In between the perturbations (deep breathing
and hand grip), the subject stood at rest for 60 s.
B. Measurement of PTT and PAT
From the data thus collected, PTT and PAT were measured
as follows. First, the BP waveform was smoothed by a Butterworth low-pass filter with 100-Hz cutoff frequency. Second, the
R wave in each ECG beat was detected as the local maximum
within each ECG beat. Third, individual BP and BCG beats were
extracted guided by the ECG R waves. Fourth, BCG beats were
smoothed with an exponential moving-average filtering technique as described in a previous study [27]. Fifth, the I wave
of the BCG waveform was extracted from each BCG beat as
the local minimum occurring right before the J wave (detected
as the peak between the ECG R wave and the systolic maximum of BP waveform) within each BCG beat.1 Sixth, distal
timing references were extracted from each BP beat using the
intersecting tangent [28], maximum second derivative, diastolic
minimum, and systolic maximum methods. Finally, PTT associated with each individual beat was measured as the time interval
between the BCG I wave and the distal timing references, while
PAT associated with each individual beat was measured as the
time interval between the ECG R wave and the distal timing
references. Thus, a total of four PTT and four PAT values were
determined for each beat (see Fig. 3).

1 Though not shown in detail, we used the I wave in this study because the
correlation between PTT and BP was consistently stronger with the I wave as
proximal timing reference than J wave or H wave.

and PAT, respectively. The subscripts 1–4 in PTT and PAT denote distal timing
reference (1: diastolic minimum, 2: maximum second derivative, 3: intersecting
tangent, 4: systolic maximum).

C. Data Analysis
Before performing the correlation analysis, PTT and PAT sequences measured for each subject were smoothed with a Butterworth low-pass filter with 0.1-Hz cutoff frequency to prevent
the degradation of PTT-BP correlation by inadequately measured PTT samples arising from the BCG beats corrupted by
motion artifacts. Then, a logarithmic model (1), derived from
the Moens–Korteweg equation [29] and an exponential arterial

(1)

where P denotes BP (DP, MP or SP), T is either PTT or PAT,
and K1 and K2 are individual-specific parameters. For each
subject, three sets of K1 and K2 values (each corresponding to
DP, MP, and SP, respectively) were derived via the least-squares
method for PTT and PAT, respectively. Finally, using the same
data pairs, PTT and PAT were transformed to BP by plugging
them into the calibration equations.
In each subject, correlation coefficients (i.e., the r values) between true versus estimated DP, MP, and SP were computed.
Noting that four distal timing references were considered in
measuring PTT and PAT; totally 12 r values were computed for
each subject (3 BP × 4 distal timing references). The statistical
significance in differences between the r values associated with
PTT versus their PAT counterparts was examined in two ways.
First, the paired t-test was applied to the r values for PTT and
PAT related to each distal timing reference (i.e., 15 samples).
Second, the paired t-test was then applied to the r values for PTT
and PAT related to all the distal timing references (thus 60 samples). The second analysis was conducted to compare PTT and
PAT independently of the choice of distal timing reference, due
to the observation that the distal timing reference corresponding
to the best r value was different in different subjects.
III. RESULTS
The mean BP (DP, MP, and SP) as well as HR and PTT values
were largely different across subjects. DP, MP, and SP varied

versus PTT- and PAT-estimated BP in a test subject (the r values
were 0.79 and 0.59 (DP), 0.83 and 0.69 (MP), and 0.84 and 0.75
(SP) for PTT and PAT, respectively). Fig. 6 shows the correlation

the different in the r values between PTT- versus PAT-estimated
BP. Fig. 7 shows the Bland–Altman statistics for BP associated
with PTT (upper panel) and PAT (lower panel), respectively,
computed across all subjects.
IV. DISCUSSION
Despite its widespread use and demonstrated correlation with
BP (especially SP), ECG-based PAT has often exhibited poor
correlation with DP presumably due to its dependence on PEP.
By virtue of its direct relation to the mechanical activity of the
heart, BCG may potentially be used as proximal timing reference for PTT measurement. The central hypothesis of this study
was that BCG could be a viable proximal timing reference in
measuring PTT, and that BCG-based PTT may be superior to
ECG-based PAT in estimating DP. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first intensive investigation to examine
the efficacy of BCG, compared with ECG, as a proximal timing
reference for measuring PTT and estimating BP.
A. Subject Demographics and Physiologic States
The BP perturbation protocol designed in this study was able
to widely vary BP and HR as well as PTT and PAT, which

PTT based on BCG as proximal timing reference was correlated with BP reasonably well (see Table II and Figs. 5 and
6), and the corresponding confidence interval was also narrow
(see Fig. 7). The r values ranging between 0.54 and 0.66 between DP and PTT are much higher than, while those ranging
between 0.61 and 0.70 between SP and PTT are comparable to
those reported in the previous studies with ECG and noninvasive wrist/finger BP as proximal and distal arterial waveforms,
respectively, such as 0.30 (DP) and 0.85 (SP) [31], 0.40 ± 0.35
(DP) and 0.70 ± 0.14 (SP) [32], 0.26–0.57 (DP) and 0.74–0.79
(SP) [33], and 0.41 (DP) and 0.26 (SP) [34].
Comparing the r values for PTT associated with each distal
timing reference, the systolic maximum method resulted in the
highest r values consistently for DP, MP, and SP, followed by
the intersecting tangent, diastolic minimum, and maximum second derivative methods. The differences in the r values between
systolic maximum and intersecting tangent methods were not
significant. In contrast, those between systolic maximum and
maximum second derivative methods were significant (p < 0.05
for DP, MP, and SP consistently). In general, systolic maximum
is not considered as ideal timing reference due to its susceptibility to corruption due to the wave reflection phenomena [10].
In fact, studies have shown that intersecting tangent method is
a preferred choice due to its robustness to morphological artifacts in the arterial waveforms (see, e.g., [35]). Regardless, we
found two studies in which PTT determined using the systolic
maximum as distal timing reference showed a strong correlation with SP despite a relatively weak correlation with DP (0.85
(SP) versus 0.30 (DP) [31] and 0.75 ± 0.10 (SP) versus 0.44 ±
0.34 (DP) [32]). Interestingly, subjects recruited in these studies, as well as ours, were healthy young adults. The efficacy
of the systolic maximum method in these subjects may in part
be attributed to relatively small wave reflection in these subjects, which may then resulted in negligible corruption of the
systolic upstroke waveform (since early systolic augmentation
of reflecting BP wave may be nondominant in these subjects).
Nonetheless, the statistical insignificance in the difference between systolic maximum versus intersecting tangent methods
supports the recommendation that the latter is an adequate distal timing reference in measuring PTT [35].
C. Comparison With PAT
The r values associated with PAT were comparable to those
we found in the previous studies in which ECG R wave and
photoplethysmogram were used as proximal and distal timing
references [0.53 ± 0.10 for DP and 0.76 ± 0.05 for SP (mean
± SD)] [5]–[9], [13]–[16], [36]–[47].
The most notable finding from the comparison between PTT
versus PAT is that PTT was more strongly correlated with
DP than PAT regardless of the distal timing reference: the
mean r values associated with PTT for intersecting tangent,
maximum second derivative, diastolic minimum, and systolic

maximum methods were all higher than their PAT counterparts
by 22% (p = 0.07), 10% (p = 0.17), 12% (p = 0.37) and 10%
(p = 0.10), respectively (see Table II). As well, PTT-estimated
BP resulted in modestly narrower confidence interval (2×SD)
than its PAT counterpart: confidence interval associated with
PTT was 8.8%, 5.5% and 1.0% narrower for DP, MP and SP,
respectively, when the intersecting tangent method was used as
distal timing reference. Considering the relatively small number
of subjects recruited in this study, the results for the intersecting
tangent method look especially promising. In fact, the difference

between PTT and PAT was statistically significant (p = 0.01)
when the r values associated with all the distal timing references (thus 60 r values) were compared altogether. The BCG
waveform is known to be more easily corrupted by motion artifacts (especially in the standing posture) compared with ECG.
Nonetheless, PTT with BCG used as proximal timing reference
exhibited stronger correlation to DP and MP than PAT. This
supports the central hypothesis of this work, that BCG may be
used as proximal timing reference for PTT, and that BCG-based
PTT may be superior to ECG-based PAT in estimating DP. In
contrast to DP (and MP as well), PAT modestly outperformed
PTT in estimating SP, although statistical significance could
not be established. This finding is actually consistent with the
previous observations that PAT is strongly correlated with SP
(though the underlying mechanism has not been clearly understood) [5], [7], [16], [37], [42]. Fig. 5 illustrates that 1) PTTand PAT-estimated BP track true BP adequately and 2) PTT is
overall superior to PAT but is also more susceptible to motion
artifacts (as exemplified by the fluctuations in PTT-estimated
BP at t = 150 s and t = 200 s during the sustained hand grip
maneuver), while Fig. 7 shows that PTT-estimated DP and MP
are associated with smaller numbers of outliers compared with
their PAT counterparts.
In sum, the results of our study indicated that PAT generally
correlated well with SP and was noise robust, while PTT correlated with DP better than PAT. BCG was more susceptible to
motion artifacts than ECG. However, it may be more convenient than ECG because its waveform can be measured without
a sensor placed on the body.

D. Limitations and Opportunities
This study has a number of limitations that must be examined
in the follow-up investigations. First, the subjects recruited in
this study were rather homogeneous: they were all young and
healthy, and none was hypertensive. To rigorously assess the
relevance and efficacy of BCG-based PTT, future work must

evaluate how it can estimate BP in a large number of heterogeneous subjects from a wide range of populations. In particular,
the efficacy of the systolic maximum as distal timing reference in older subjects should be examined. Second, this study
did not explore diverse BP-varying perturbations. More specifically, we used only two perturbations in this study, both of
which may have varied BP mainly by altering cardiac output.
These perturbations also incurred body motion artifacts that may
have distorted BCG measurement to an extent. In this regard, a
wide range of BP perturbation protocols must be designed and
employed to rigorously investigate the efficacy of BCG-based
PTT. Third, with the goal of making initial grasp of strengths
and weaknesses of BCG as proximal timing reference for PTT,
this study employed only the basic foot detection methods that
could be implemented very easily. However, the measurement
of PTT and PAT may benefit from more sophisticated methods that are potentially more robust against artifacts and noise
[48]–[54]. Future study must conduct comparative evaluation
of PTT and PAT determined by such methods in estimating BP.
Finally, this study did not examine the long-term validity of the
calibration model (1) between BP versus PTT and PAT. The
goal of this study was to examine the correlation between BP
versus BCG-based PTT. So, long-term calibration capability of
(1) was beyond the scope of this study. A related limitation is
that we low-pass filtered PTT sequence (and PAT as well) before
deriving (1). We employed low-pass filtering to automatically
suppress the adverse impact of artifacts rather than manually
removing the corrupted data for two reasons: identifying BCG
beats corrupted by artifacts is very challenging; in addition, PTT
was perhaps continually influenced by artifact, especially during the sustained hand grip maneuver (see Fig. 4). However,

KIM et al.: BALLISTOCARDIOGRAM AS PROXIMAL TIMING REFERENCE FOR PULSE TRANSIT TIME MEASUREMENT

low-pass filtering may also have removed valuable information
on high-frequency variability in BP from PTT sequence, thus
limiting the validity of this study to the efficacy of PTT in tracking relatively slow variability in BP. Future work must examine
the consistency and reliability of the calibration model (1) with
respect to time over the course of a longitudinal study.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We demonstrated that BCG may be used as proximal timing reference in measuring PTT, and BCG-based PTT may be
superior to PAT in estimating DP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first intensive study to examine the validity of
BCG in measuring PTT and, ultimately, in estimating BP. The
results from our study show promise. Yet, there are still open
challenges before the efficacy of BCG in measuring PTT can
be established. Follow-up studies are required to further elucidate the strengths and weaknesses of BCG as proximal timing
reference in measuring PTT and estimating BP.
