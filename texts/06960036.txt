via Model-Based System Identification

and Jin-Oh Hahn, Member, IEEE

Abstract—In this study, we present a system identification approach to the mathematical modeling of hemodynamic responses to
vasopressor-inotrope agents. We developed a hybrid model called
the latency-dose–response-cardiovascular (LDC) model that incorporated 1) a low-order lumped latency model to reproduce the
delay associated with the transport of vasopressor-inotrope agent
and the onset of physiological effect, 2) phenomenological dose–
response models to dictate the steady-state inotropic, chronotropic,
and vasoactive responses as a function of vasopressor-inotrope
dose, and 3) a physiological cardiovascular model to translate
the agent’s actions into the ultimate response of blood pressure.
We assessed the validity of the LDC model to fit vasopressorinotrope dose–response data using data collected from five piglet
subjects during variable epinephrine infusion rates. The results
suggested that the LDC model was viable in modeling the subjects’ dynamic responses: After tuning the model to each subject,
the r2 values for measured versus model-predicted mean arterial
pressure were consistently higher than 0.73. The results also suggested that intersubject variability in the dose–response models,
rather than the latency models, had significantly more impact
on the model’s predictive capability: Fixing the latency model to
population-averaged parameter values resulted in r2 values higher
than 0.57 between measured versus model-predicted mean arterial pressure, while fixing the dose–response model to populationaveraged parameter values yielded nonphysiological predictions of
mean arterial pressure. We conclude that the dose–response relationship must be individualized, whereas a population-averaged
latency-model may be acceptable with minimal loss of model fidelity.

(CV) compromise and shock. These agents act through one or
more physiological effector mechanisms, such as 1) increasing
resistance to blood exiting the arterial vessels [total peripheral
resistance (TPR)], 2) increasing CO through increased heart rate
(HR) and cardiac contractility, and 3) decreasing venous capacitance to increase effective circulating blood volume and cardiac
preload [1].
Clinically, these agents are employed to maintain a patient’s
BP within a resuscitation goal (e.g., 60 mmHg < mean arterial
BP (MAP) < 100 mmHg [1]–[5]). There is significant interindividual variability in the CV response to different dosage levels
[6]–[10]; therefore, in practice, vasopressor-inotrope infusion
dose is empirically titrated by a clinician to achieve the desired hemodynamic effect. In a recent study, we suggested that
a mathematical model-based approach may be useful for efficient dosage-selection [11]. We showed that a subject’s hemodynamic response to vasopressor-inotrope infusion, in terms of
the CV parameters of stroke volume (SV) and TPR, and also the
BP response, may be predicted by employing phenomenological dose–response models adapted to the subject’s noninvasive
BP (NIBP) response at two or more vasopressor-inotrope infusion doses. However, this approach required measurements of
NIBP obtained after steady state was achieved, and likewise,
the model only estimated the steady-state response, not the dynamic response, for a given infusion level. This aforementioned
method was not capable of predicting transient hemodynamic
responses, and therefore may be suboptimal for decision-support
and closed-loop control.
The current report is a follow-up study to assess the validity
of the above mathematical model-based paradigm in analyzing
vasopressor-inotrope dose–response data, now moving to accommodate complex dynamic transients and interactions among
multiple receptor effects. To cope with the complexity of the
data, we extended the preliminary model [11] to derive a
hybrid model called the “latency-dose–response-CV” (LDC)
model. This hybrid model includes a low-order lumped latency model, as well as several other enhancements to reproduce dose–response behavior under diverse physiological states.
In a previous study [12], we conducted a rigorous investigation to test the capability of the LDC model to reproduce not
only BP but also other CV parameter responses measured under diverse physiological states. In this study, we expand the
previous work to examine 1) the efficacy of the LDC model
in predicting the hemodynamic response to epinephrine, and
2) the relative importance of individualizing latency versus
dose–response models in achieving a low-order but high-fidelity
LDC model.

dose directly to the hypothetical “steady-state-equivalent” infusion dose acting at the site of action (i.e., the “steady-stateequivalent” infusion dose is the steady-state dose that would
yield the physiological effects that are observed at a given time
t). The lumped latency model incorporates simple first-order
dynamics and a time delay.
This lumped latency model is based on a low-order model
we developed in a previous study, which was shown to be a
promising approach to individualized dose–response modeling
[18]. The model describes the dynamics associated with the
transport of an agent and its elicitation of clinical effect as a
lumped 1-compartment model with delay:

and physiological onset latency, and u denotes the actual intravenous vasopressor-inotrope dose.
B. Dose–Response Relationship

This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents
the LDC model. Section III describes the experimental and
analytical procedures to validate the LDC model. Results are
shown and discussed in Section IV. Section V concludes the
paper.
II. HYBRID LDC MODEL
The LDC model is an extended version of the preliminary
model reported in our earlier study [11] (see Fig. 1). As before,
the Windkessel (WK) model [13], [14] is the CV model used
to relate CV parameters (SV, TPR, and HR) to BP. However, to
account for dynamic transients and widely changing physiological state, the preliminary model (which could analyze only the
steady-state dose-response) was strengthened by incorporating
1) the dynamics associated with the transport of agents and their
onset of physiological effects, and 2) the improved phenomenological dose–response models through pressure-dependent
arterial compliance (AC) and the interaction among multiple
receptor effects.

To predict hemodynamic responses from the hypothetical
steady-state-equivalent vasopressor-inotrope infusion doses necessitates dose–response models. Vasopressor-inotropes alter
BP by stimulating the CV adrenergic receptors [19]–[22] and
ultimately modulating the CV parameters of TPR, SV, and HR.
In this study, we modeled the dose–response relationship of
epinephrine. However, the computational methodology could
be modified (using alternative dose–response models) for different agents.
The dose–response model employed in the LDC model includes all the known clinical effects elicited by epinephrine: vasoactive (TPR), inotropic (SV), and chronotropic (HR) effects
[see (2)]. Its effect on MAP is dependent on the administered
infusion dose [1], [19], [23]. Specifically, TPR response consists of a baseline term (TPR0 ), a vasodilation term (ΔTPR1 )
elicited in the low dose, i.e., predominant beta-agonist, range,
and a vasoconstriction term (ΔTPR2 ) elicited in the high dose,
i.e., predominant alpha-agonist, range:

A. Lumped Latency Model
The lumped latency model we employed in the LDC model
is distinct from classical pharmacological models in that it
does not explicitly involve blood concentration of the agent.
In the classical pharmacological models, multicompartmental
models are used to relate the infusion dose of an agent to its
blood concentration by describing the mixing and elimination of
the agent in the blood in response to its infusion dose [15]. The
blood concentration is then mapped to the concentration at the
site of action via a first-order system (e.g., [16]) often accompanied by a time delay (e.g., [17]). In contrast, the lumped latency
model employed in the LDC model relates the actual infusion

where δV0 is the baseline values, while ki,δ V (i = 1, . . . , 6) are
unknowns to be determined from dose–response data.
Note that in (2a) and (2b), the Hill equation models (or
the Em ax models; see, e.g., [24]) were included to reproduce

a chronotropic term (ΔHR1 ):

To examine the validity of the LDC model, we conducted a
secondary analysis of existing data collected from piglet subjects [26]. The data includes epinephrine infusion dose and the
resulting hemodynamic responses under a number of infusion
doses that are adequate to validate the LDC model. Our primary
goal was to understand the degree to which the LDC model can
reproduce the experimental data when it is (either fully or partially) individualized. So, for each subject, we used all available
data to train and test the model.

where HR0 is the baseline value, while ki,HR (i = 1, . . . , 3) are

The baseline values (TPR0 , δV0 , HR0 ) in the dose–response
relationships above are regarded as known quantities, because
they can be deduced from the baseline physiological state and,
thus, can be expressed via baseline BP and HR measurements
and the remaining parameters in (2) (see Section III-B for
details).
C. Physiological CV Model: WK Model
Once the responses of CV parameters (TPR, SV, and HR) are
determined from the phenomenological dose–response models
(2), the WK model is used to compute the resulting BP response
including systolic pressure (SP), MAP, and pulse pressure (PP).
In particular, we have shown that MAP and SP can be computed
from the CV parameters as follows [11]:

The data were collected from five neonatal Yorkshire Duroc
piglets (age 10 +/– 3 d and weight 2.4 +/– 0.6 kg) in a previous
study [26]. For each piglet, after a baseline period, an escalating dose of epinephrine was administered, which ranged from
low (0.25 mcg/kg/min), medium, (0.5 and 0.75 mcg/kg/min)
and high doses (1, 1.5, and 2 mcg/kg/min). Each dose was
maintained for 15 min before new dose was applied. BP and
HR responses were collected in real time at a sampling rate
of 0.2 Hz. The full details of the experimental protocol can
be found in Nachar et al. [26]. Before analyzing the data, we
manually identified the artifacts in the measurement that manifested as isolated large, sudden increases in BP (> 30 mmHg).
In addition, we visually examined the data together with the
event logs to identify the data associated with blood draws and
seizure activity. In sum, the data corresponding to the artifacts
amounted to only 1.6% of the data, and they were not included
in the subsequent analysis.
B. Model Identification and Validation Procedures
The LDC model was adapted to data corresponding to an individual subject as follows. First, the CV model (3) computed
TPR · C and δCV from MAP and SP data. Second, the unknown
parameters in the lumped latency models (1), the dose–response
models (2), and the AC model (4) were determined by minimizing the discrepancy between TPR · C and δCV predicted by the
models versus those directly computed from MAP and SP data.
Specifically, the models of TPR · C and δCV were implemented
by combining (2a), (2b), and (4):

lumped latency models, while AC was computed by (4)1 (Step
2 in Fig. 1). Third, the CV model (3) predicted the resulting
BP responses based on the CV parameter responses (Step 3 in
Fig. 1).
Once individual-specific model parameters were obtained for
all the subjects, the impact of intersubject variability in lumped
latency models and in dose–response models on the predictive
efficacy of the LDC model was examined as follows. First, we
predicted hemodynamics responses using 1) fully individualized LDC models [Individualized Latency and Individualized
Dose-Reponse (IL-ID)], 2) LDC model with average latency
parameters [“Population-Based Latency and Individualized
Dose-Response (PL-ID)], and 3) LDC model with average
dose–response model for TPR, SV, and HR (IL − PDX , X∈
{TPR, δV, HR}). Then, we computed the r2 values between
measured versus model-predicted CV parameter and BP responses. Finally, we examined these r2 values to assess the
benefit of individualizing the parameters in the LDC model.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Primary Findings and Generalizable Lessons
Table I summarizes the physiological data obtained in the
piglets, including SP, MAP, DP, and HR (which were directly
measured) as well as TPR · C and δCV [which were computed
from the CV model (3)]. Fig. 2 shows measured and modelpredicted MAP and HR responses in all piglets,2 in which the
root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) in MAP prediction associated with the IL-ID, PL-ID, and IL − PDHR models were 9.1
+/– 2.1, 10.6 +/– 3.2, and 17.0 +/– 5.7 mmHg, respectively,
while the RMSEs in HR prediction associated with the same
models were 10.4 +/–3.6, 21.3 +/–9.9, and 63.6 +/–26.1 bpm,
respectively (mean +/– SD). In addition, the limits of agreement between measured versus predicted MAP and HR were –
19.9 –15.2 mmHg and –19.3 –23.0 bpm (IL-ID), –24.1 –16.3
mmHg and –50.0 –37.6 bpm (PL-ID), and –32.0 –37.1 mmHg
and –93.8 –149 bpm (IL − PDHR ), respectively. Table II shows

is a measurement artifact.

the r2 values between measured MAP and HR responses versus those predicted by the IL-ID, PL-ID, and IL − PDX LDC
models, and Fig. 3 shows measured and model-predicted MAP
responses for these models. Table III summarizes the distributions of the parameters in the LDC model.
One primary finding of this investigation was that the LDC
model offered a reasonable prediction of the relationship between epinephrine dosage versus CV parameters including MAP
and HR. The LDC model exhibited the anticipated phenomena such as a biphasic TPR response, monotonic chronotropic
effect, and the effect of afterload in the high infusion dose
region.
This encouraging performance is notable for two reasons.
First, the LDC models predicted each subject’s CV trends despite substantial individual variability. Consider that Subject #2
had a HR ranging between 252 +/–72.6 bpm (mean+ /– SD)
while Subject #5 had a HR ranging between 334 +/–100 bpm
(see Table I); the distributions of their HR values were quite distinct. Despite such variability, HR prediction was quite accurate
using the LDC models with r2 values > 0.90 for every subject.
The prediction of dynamic HR response to changing epinephrine
dosage was also promising; compare the actual HR versus predicted HR for Subjects #1–#5 in Fig. 2 (second column) where
it is evident that the latency model captured the dynamics of the
system properly.
The r2 values for MAP, ranging from 0.73 to 0.86, were also
encouraging (see Table II). Although prediction of MAP was
modestly worse than prediction of HR in terms of r2 values,
the findings were still notable because the LDC model did not
directly estimate a relationship between epinephrine dosage and
MAP. Rather, the LDC model inferred the underlying relationships between TPR, SV, and HR, and successfully predicted
MAP on the basis of those inferred models.
On the other hand, Fig. 3 also reveals the limitation of these
approaches. During the escalating doses of epinephrine infusions, measured MAP was a fundamentally oscillatory signal
without a “true” steady state. Importantly, such oscillations were
not present in the preepinephrine (baseline) period, and the cause
of this oscillatory response is unclear [26]. During each interval of constant epinephrine infusion, there were 1–2 cycles of
MAP oscillation that could not be modeled by the LDC model.
Furthermore, when the epinephrine dose was changed, the

dynamic response in the measured MAP was masked by these
oscillations. Overall, our analysis suggests that the benefit of
an individualized latency model (IL-ID) seems modest, and to
avoid the overfitting of MAP response corrupted by unmodeled
oscillations, it may be appropriate to use group-averaged terms
for latency reflective of typical mixing times and physiological
onset delays.
While our findings do not entirely support the usefulness
of the individualized latency model (which is in part due to
epinephrine-specific oscillations), the findings strongly support
the need for individualized dose–response models. When one
examines the intersubject inconsistencies in physiological response as a function of epinephrine dose (see Table I), it is
obvious that substantial individualization would be necessary to
predict each subject’s dose-response. Table III demonstrates
that there was considerable variability between the model parameters fitted to different subjects. This trend was consistent
for the parameters in the AC model (4): k1 = 1.3 × 10−2 with
17 % standard deviation (SD) and k2 = 7.8 × 10−2 with 227 %
SD, respectively. Moreover, when HR dose–response parame-

ters were group-averaged (see Fig. 3), the MAP prediction efficacy unacceptably deteriorated. Prediction efficacy was even
worse when TPR and SV dose–response parameters were averaged (see Table III). In particular, the group-averaged SV dose–
response model predicted a nonphysiological (i.e., negative) SV
in the high epinephrine dose region due to the exaggerated afterload effect, resulting in an unacceptable MAP response for
all the subjects with r2 values lower than zero. Altogether, these
findings indicate that the dose–response models must be individualized: It is evident that different subjects had different
quantitative responses to epinephrine (see Table I) and that the
LDC model, when using population-averaged parameter values,
yielded nonphysiological predictions (see Table III).
In sum, these findings lead us to a generalizable lesson regarding the tradeoff between model complexity and
individualization capability. Complex subject-specific models
can offer adequate individualization capability, but its large
degrees of freedom may result in nonphysiological and even
unstable responses unless properly fitted to each individual.
Simple group-averaged models can provide physiologically

acceptable responses, but they cannot be as accurate as complex subject-specific models. Therefore, appropriate balance
between individualized and group-averaged components is essential to achieve stable and accurate prediction of physiological
responses to medication agents.
B. Limitations of Study
There is a remaining question, which although outside the
scope of the current investigation, is important to consider for
future work: Is the LDC model suitable for predicting hemodynamic responses to epinephrine? Due to the presence of BP oscillations associated with epinephrine administration, the LDC
model could not perfectly predict BP response to epinephrine.
However, it is unknown how the LDC model would have performed in the absence of these oscillations. Future work on data
not resulting in an oscillatory BP (such as dopamine and dobutamine [26]) will be able to answer this question. Regardless,
we can conceptually contemplate if this model is too simple, too
complex, or generally appropriate for practical use.
We do not think the model is too simple: It includes terms
to quantify most of the known effects of epinephrine, including
a biphasic TPR response, pressure-dependent AC, monotonic
chronotropic effect, and the effect of afterload in the high infusion dose region. We have found that a simpler version of
this model (i.e., [11]) and the current iteration (e.g., Fig. 1) can
yield favorable predictive capability (though, as noted above,
the current model could not capture the oscillations in MAP
specific to epinephrine, leading to the one shortcoming in MAP
prediction).
More likely, the current model may be too complicated to
serve as a practical tool for dose selection. The usefulness of
the model will further be exacerbated if additional mechanisms
to model the oscillatory MAP behavior (such as autonomic reflex mechanism) are being taken into account. In theory, even
highly complicated models can be determined as long as persistently exciting dose–response data (e.g., having many dose
changes) are available [28]. However, multiple changes in infusion dose may not be commonly available in real clinical setting
when epinephrine-dosing changes are made to treat the patient
rather than to facilitate dose–response modeling. In the future,
therefore, it will be appropriate to reduce model complexity
allowing for individual predictive capability without extensive
training data from each subject.
Finally, the validity of the LDC model in vasopressorinotropes other than epinephrine must be examined in the future.

Since vasopressor-inotropes commonly exhibit latency, doseresponse, and physiological (CV) mechanisms, the methodological framework presented in this study should be universally
applicable to a range of vasopressor-inotropes. However, due
to the differences in the specific mechanisms of action associated with each vasopressor-inotrope, dose–response models specific to each vasopressor-inotrope must be derived and
validated independently. In this regard, future effort on dose–
response modeling of a wide spectrum of vasopressor-inotropes
will be necessary to facilitate the real-world application of the
LDC model.
In our opinion, the current report contributes to the basic
understanding of epinephrine response modeling, focused on
the suitability of individualizing the latency of response versus
the dose-response. At the same time, how to individualize the
LDC model based on sparse individual data still remains an
open question, and novel methods to individualize such a model
using minimal training data must be studied.
V. CONCLUSION
This report presented a hybrid LDC model to reproduce individualized hemodynamic responses to epinephrine. By applying
it to epinephrine dose–response data, the LDC model was shown
to be able to accurately predict hemodynamic responses. The
study also revealed that relatively complex dose–response relationships were required to faithfully predict the hemodynamic
responses. Finally, there was large inter–subject variability in
the epinephrine dose-response, which necessitates the study on
viable individualization methods based on data routinely available in real clinical setting.
