Unit Indices Derived from Surface
EMG in Chronic Stroke
Xiaoyan Li, Jie Liu, Sheng Li, Ying-Chih Wang,
and Ping Zhou∗ , Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—In this study, we used muscle and motor unit indices,
derived from convenient surface electromyography (EMG) measurements, for examination of paretic muscle changes post stroke.
For 12 stroke subjects, compound muscle action potential and
voluntary surface EMG signals were recorded from paretic and
contralateral first dorsal interosseous, abductor pollicis brevis,
and abductor digiti minimi muscles. Muscle activation index (AI),
motor unit number index (MUNIX), and motor unit size index
(MUSIX) were then calculated for each muscle. There was a significant AI reduction for all the three muscles in paretic side compared
with contralateral side, providing an evidence of muscle activation
deficiency after stroke. The hand MUNIX (defined by summing the
values from the three muscles) was significantly reduced in paretic
side compared with contralateral side, whereas the hand MUSIX
was not significantly different. Furthermore, diverse changes in
MUNIX and MUSIX were observed from the three muscles. A major feature of the present examinations is the primary reliance on
surface EMG, which offers practical benefits because it is noninvasive, induces minimal discomfort and can be performed quickly.
Index Terms—Chronic stroke, compound muscle action
potential (CMAP), motor unit number index (MUNIX), motor unit
size index (MUSIX), muscle activation, surface electromyography
(EMG).

hypertonia, weakness, and impaired movement coordination)
on the contralesional side of the body, among which weakness
or inability to generate normal levels of muscle force has been
recognized as one of the most serious impairment leading to
disability in stroke patients [1]. Muscle strength deficits of stroke
patients and their associations with performance on functional
tasks have been extensively investigated. A study has shown a
strong negative correlation between lower limb muscle strength
deficits and gait performance [2]. The relation between strength
deficits of upper limb muscles and arm performance has also
been studied [3]–[6]. For example, hand grip strength was shown
to be a good predictor of motor performance and therefore,
serves a valuable marker for recovery of arm function for stroke
patients [6].
To understand motor function impairment after stroke, a variety of electrophysiological studies have been performed to
examine hemiparetic muscle changes at different levels, focusing on muscle fiber (single fiber electromyography (EMG) [7],
[8], [14]), motor unit (concentric needle EMG [7], [9] [13],
fine wire EMG [16], [17], and macro EMG [15]), and global
muscle (surface EMG [10]–[12]) activities, respectively. Using
incremental nerve stimulations, motor unit number estimation
(MUNE) techniques that rely on laborious estimation of single
motor unit size have been applied to assess loss of functional
motor units in paretic muscles, as a result of spinal motoneuron
degeneration after stroke [18]–[20]. With advances in both surface EMG recording and processing techniques, high-density
surface electrodes have also found applications in revealing
hemiparetic muscle changes at both the global muscle and motor
unit levels [21]. However, most of the previous methods tend to
be laborious, require expensive equipment, or require patients
to tolerate needles.
Among a range of electrophysiological examinations, probably the most convenient and easy-to-apply methods are noninvasive measurements of voluntary surface EMG and compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) with conventional surface electrodes. In this study we used indices derived from such
measurements to examine paretic muscle changes post stroke.
Specifically, we investigated application of motor unit number
index (MUNIX), motor unit size index (MUSIX) [22], [23],
and muscle activation index (AI) [24] for examination of three
hand muscles. We examined whether these indices were significantly different between paretic and contralateral hands. Such
examination can provide useful data to help understand the underlying neuromuscular mechanisms of stroke induced motor

II. METHODS
A. Subjects
Twelve subjects (7 male, 5 female, 59.9 ± 12.0 years) who
sustained hemispheric stroke participated in this study. All the
subjects were recruited by using the Clinical Neuroscience
Research Registry at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago
(Chicago, IL, USA). A screening examination and clinical assessment were performed to determine the eligibility for each
stroke subject (Table I). Hand grip strength was measured bilaterally for each stroke subject using a portable Jamar Plus digital
hand dynamometer (model EN-120604), and a comparison of
grip strength of paretic and contralateral hands of the stroke
subjects is presented as part of Table I. The study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of Northwestern University
(Chicago, IL, USA). All the subjects gave their written consent
before any assessment or recording procedures.
B. Data Acquisition
The experiments were performed on both the affected and
contralateral hands in all the stroke subjects. Three muscles were
examined for each hand: the first dorsal interosseous (FDI), the
abductor pollicis brevis (APB), and the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles. A random order was used for examination of different muscles. Subjects were seated comfortably
in a chair with the examined forearm placed in a natural position on a height-adjustable table. Subjects were instructed
to relax at the wrist, elbow, and shoulder. A constant laboratory temperature (approximately 295 K) was maintained during
the data collection.
Prior to the recording, each subject’s skin over the ulnar and
medial aspects of the wrist, the back of the hand and the palm,
the index finger, the thumb, and the little finger were lightly

abraded and cleaned with rubbing alcohol. A small amount
of conductive electrode cream was applied to reduce skin–
electrode impedance and then wiped to ensure not to leave any
on the skin (to avoid short-circuiting the electrodes). The primary equipment used for this study was Sierra Wave EMG system (Cadwell Lab Inc, Kennewick, WA, USA). Electrode placement was similar to that for standard motor conduction studies
[25]. Two 10-mm (diameter) silver/silver chloride disc surface
electrodes were used to record surface EMG from the examined
muscle. The active surface electrode was positioned over the
examined muscle with the reference surface electrode placed on
the second metacarpophalangeal joint for the FDI muscle, on
the distal phalanx of the little finger for the ADM muscle, and
on the metacarpal phalangeal joint of the thumb for the APB
muscle, respectively. For each of the recordings, an adhesive
large ground electrode was placed on the dorsum of the hand
between the stimulus and recording sites. All surface electrode
positions were further reinforced with surgical tapes to reduce
movement during the recording. A remote handheld stimulator with a StimTroller was used to generate stimuli through a
cathode (a 10-mm silver/silver chloride pole). The duration of
each single pulse stimulus was 200 μs. The M wave was evoked
with a cathode placed 2-cm proximal to the wrist crease over
the ulnar nerve (for the FDI or ADM muscles) or the median
nerve (for the APB muscle). For each examined muscle, different electrode positions were tested to ensure that the CMAP
amplitude was maximized. A CMAP from each muscle was obtained by stimulation of the ulnar or median nerve at the wrist
using intensity sufficient to elicit a maximum response. The
stimulation intensity started around 15 mA, increasing approximately 20% above that amplitude each step, until the maximum
motor response was reached. This was confirmed by no enlargement in the peak-to-peak amplitude of the M wave with further
increased stimulation intensities.
After the CMAP recording, the voluntary surface EMG signals were recorded from the examined muscle with the electrodes maintained at the same position. The subject was instructed to generate an isometric muscle contraction at four to
six different levels representing minimal to maximal effort (index finger abduction for the FDI muscle, thumb abduction for
the APB muscle, and little finger abduction for the ADM muscle). The force levels were defined by the examiner providing
resistance to the tested muscle. The different force levels were
performed using a single trial with graded contraction consisting
of four to six interference EMG epochs (each graded contraction lasting for at least 2 s). Two trials were collected for each
muscle. Substantial rest was allowed during the experiment to
avoid muscle fatigue.
For all the subjects, the CMAP and voluntary surface EMG
recordings were sampled at 6.4 and 32 kHz, with a bandpass filter setting at 3 Hz–2 kHz and 10 Hz–10 kHz, respectively (highcut filter: 2-pole, 12 dB/octave; lowcut filter: 1-pole,
6 dB/octave). A system notch filter was used to remove the
power line interference noise from the voluntary surface EMG
but not for CMAP signals. All the signals were recorded
by a differential ac amplifier and stored to a hard disk for
offline analysis.

solid lines with stars; contralateral: dotted lines with squares. MUNIX is defined as the ICMUC value (Y-axis) when the surface EMG area (X-axis) equals
20 mVms.

C. Data Analysis
1) MUNIX Calculation: The CMAP and different levels of
surface interference pattern (SIP) EMG were used to compute
the MUNIX for the examined muscle. The details of MUNIX
calculation have been described in [22] and [23]. In brief, the
area and power of the CMAP and the SIPs (for a one-second
epoch) at different voluntary contraction levels were first calculated. These values were used to compute the “ideal case motor
unit count (ICMUC),” defined as the ratio of the CMAP power
multiplying SIP area to CMAP area multiplying SIP power.
The relation between the ICMUC and SIP area was modeled as
ICMUC = β(SIP area)α , and linear regression between logarithms of ICMUC and SIP area was used to estimate β and α. The
MUNIX was calculated as the ICMUC value when the SIP area
was 20 mV · ms, i.e., MUNIX = β(20)α . In MUNIX analysis,
it is noted that very low amplitude voluntary surface EMG signals may give very high ICMUC values. To reduce this artifact,
following Nandedkar et al. [23], three criteria were imposed to
accept an SIP epoch: (1) SIP area > 20 mV · ms; (2) ICMUC <
100; and (3) SIP area/CMAP area > 1. In addition, only those
CMAPs whose amplitude is greater than 0.5 mV were accepted
for the MUNIX analysis. In addition to MUNIX, the MUSIX,
defined as the ratio of the CMAP amplitude to the MUNIX, was
also calculated.
2) Muscle AI Calculation: For each examined muscle, we
calculated the average rectified value of the surface EMG signal (1 s duration) at the MVC level and normalized it to the
CMAP amplitude to obtain the muscle activation index (AI).
Such processing can minimize the peripheral effects and provide assessment of upper motoneuron activation [24].
3) Statistical Analysis: We measured the CMAP, MUNIX,
MUSIX, and muscle AI in each of the paretic and contralateral
muscles of stroke subjects, and further obtained hand index of
each parameter by summing or averaging the measurements
from the three muscles. Repeated measures ANOVA (RM-

ANOVA) using linear mixed model (LMM) was performed to
examine the differeces of the aformentioned parameters between the paretic and cotralateral sides (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA). It has been discussed that the LMM is more powerful to analyze repeated measures observations than other models, such as generalized linear model (GLM) [26]. Akaike’s
Information Criteria (AIC) was used as a criterion of goodnessof-fit to determine the best covariance structure for the RMANOVA model [27]. We found that compound symmetry covariance structure was more appropriate to analyze the data
than other covariance structures. Pairwise comparison using the Bonferroni correction with family confidence coefficient 0.95 was calculated for the significant effects in the
RM-ANOVA posthoc tests. In addition, correlation analysis
was conducted to determine the relationship between the relative reduction of hand grip strength and the relative alterations
in each of the examined parameters. All data were presented
in the form of mean ± standard error in the rest of the paper
unless specified.
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Hand MUNIX estimation involved calculation of MUNIX
values in the FDI, APB, and ADM muscles. Examples of the
individual muscle’s MUNIX calculation in the paretic and contralateral hands of a stroke subject (Subject 9) are presented
in Fig. 1. It was observed that the surface EMG signals at
MVC for each examined muscle were much lower in the paretic
side than the contralateral side. Likewise, the CMAP amplitude of the three examined muscles was also lower in the
paretic hand than in the contralateral hand. The MUNIX estimates, however, demonstrated reduced values in the paretic
FDI and APB muscles and slightly higher MUNIX values in
the paretic ADM muscle compared with the contralateral side.
We noted that the MUSIX values were lower for the paretic
FDI and ADM muscles and higher for the paretic APB muscle

compared with the contralateral side. By summing the values of the three muscles to obtain the hand CMAP and motor unit index, we found that the hand CMAP amplitude
and MUNIX were lower in the paretic side compared with
the contralateral side (paretic hand CMAP = 27.8 mV, contralateral hand CMAP = 35.2 mV; paretic hand MUNIX =
500, contralateral hand MUNIX = 589). The hand MUSIX
was slightly lower in the paretic side than the contralateral side (paretic hand MUSIX = 169.9 μV, contralateral
hand MUSIX = 180.7 μV).
When we averaged the values of 12 stroke subjects [see
Fig. 2(a), (b)], the LMM indicated a significant reduction of the
hand CMAP amplitude and hand MUNIX values in the paretic
side compared with the contralateral side (paretic hand CMAP:
22.7 ± 4.3 mV, contralateral hand CMAP: 28.0 ± 2.6 mV,
p < 0.01; paretic hand MUNIX: 401 ± 77, contralateral hand
MUNIX: 463 ± 69, p < 0.05).
Statistical analysis of individual muscle’s CMAP and
motor unit indices, however, showed diverse results. For
the FDI muscle, the CMAP amplitude and MUNIX values were substantially lower in the paretic side compared with the contralateral side (paretic FDI CMAP: 8.7 ±
1.1 mV, contralateral FDI CMAP: 12.4 ± 0.6 mV, p < 0.01;
paretic FDI MUNIX: 147 ± 21, contralateral FDI MUNIX:
191 ± 17, p < 0.05). The MUSIX values in the paretic muscle were lower than the contralateral side, but no significance
existed (paretic FDI MUSIX: 60.9 ± 3.1 μ V, contralateral
FDI MUSIX: 70.0 ± 6.2 μ V, p > 0.2).
In contrast, for the APB muscle, there was no significant difference in either the mean CMAP amplitude or the MUNIX
values between the paretic and contralateral muscles (paretic
APB CMAP: 6.7 ± 0.6 mV, contralateral APB CMAP: 7.2 ±
0.6 mV, p > 0.4; paretic APB MUNIX: 112 ± 10, contralat-

eral APB MUNIX: 135 ± 14, p > 0.2). The MUSIX values in
the paretic muscle were higher than the contralateral side, but
no significance existed (paretic APB MUSIX: 59.9 ± 2.0 μV,
contralateral APB MUSIX: 55.5 ± 2.7 μV, p > 0.4).
Analysis of the ADM muscles indicated a decrease of
CMAP amplitude in the paretic side (paretic ADM CMAP:
7.3 ± 0.7 mV, contralateral ADM CMAP: 8.5 ± 0.5 mV, p =
0.05). The MUNIX values from the paretic and contralateral
muscles were comparable (paretic ADM MUNIX: 140 ± 21,
contralateral ADM MUNIX: 138 ± 10, p > 0.9). The MUSIX
values in the paretic muscle were lower than the contralateral
side, but no significance existed (paretic ADM MUSIX: 55.4 ±
3.1 μV, contralateral ADM MUSIX: 64.1 ± 5.0 μV, p > 0.2).
The average muscle AI was calculated for all subjects
across the FDI, APB, and ADM muscles [see Fig. 2(c)].
A consistent observation was made that for each examined muscle, the AI was significantly reduced in the paretic
side compared with the contralateral side (paretic FDI AI =
0.0198 ± 0.0036, contralateral FDI AI = 0.0595 ± 0.0166,
p < 0.05; paretic APB AI = 0.0229 ± 0.003, contralateral
APB AI = 0.0696 ± 0.0054, p < 0.001; paretic ADM AI =
0.0167 ± 0.0029, contralateral ADM AI = 0.0586 ± 0.006,
p < 0.01). Comparison of the hand AI (averaged from
the three muscles) between paretic and contralateral
sides revealed significant lower values in the paretic
hand (paretic hand AI = 0.0198 ± 0.0022, contralateral
hand AI = 0.0626 ± 0.0085, p < 0.01).
As Fig. 3 shows, the correlation between hand MUNIX and
hand CMAP amplitude demonstrated a moderate to strong linear relation in both the paretic and contralateral sides (paretic:
R2 = 0.91, p < 0.01; contralateral: R2 = 0.38, p < 0.05). No
covariate effect from age, duration after stroke onset, chedoke
or Fugl-Meyer assessment, and grip force (p > 0.5 for all) was

IV. DISCUSSION
We used muscle and motor unit indices, derived from convenient surface EMG measurements, for examination of paretic
muscle changes post stroke. While various electrophysiological
methods (such as needle EMG [7]–[9], [13]–[17], high-density
surface EMG [21], MUNE [18]–[20], etc.) have been used for
examination of hemiparetic muscles, these methods are laborious, require expensive equipment, or require patients to tolerate
needles.
In the current study, we chose to use voluntary surface EMG
and CMAP recordings, which are noninvasive, simple to perform, and well tolerated by patients. The data analysis procedures for deriving motor unit or muscle indices are also straightforward and quick to implement. For example, the MUNIX
technique only requires minimum amounts of electrical stimulation to acquire CMAP, and thus can overcome laborious and
time-consuming estimation of the single motor unit potential
size (using either incremental nerve stimulation or spike triggered averaging techniques), required by the traditional MUNE
methods [28], [29]. Because of this advantage, the MUNIX
technique has recently achieved increasing applications, among
which most studies focused on detecting motoneuron loss and
measuring disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

2895

[30]–[38]. The validity of the MUNIX measurement in assessing motoneuron diseases has been confirmed by experimental
comparisons between MUNE and MUNIX results [39], [40], as
well as a simulation approach that relies on motoneuron pool
and surface EMG models [41], [42]. By systematically varying
the model inputs, it was demonstrated that the MUNIX estimates closely correlate with the CMAP, while variation of other
factors (such as motor unit recruitment and rate coding strategies, adjustment of motor unit recruitment range, reduction of
motor unit firing rates, etc.) is relatively not sensitive to MUNIX
estimation. This supports that MUNIX estimates can approximately characterize motor unit number changes if only varying
the number of input motor units to the model (while keeping
the motoneuron pool and muscle parameters unchanged). One
advantage of the MUNIX measurement over the CMAP is that
compared with the latter, the former is more sensitive to motor unit loss with compensatory muscle fiber reinnervation [23],
[41]. However, the simulation results also indicated reduction of
the input action potential amplitude would substantially underestimate the motor unit numbers, implying potential limitations
of the MUNIX methods (because it may be unclear whether the
MUNIX reduction is induced by loss of motor units or loss of
muscle fiber size). In such a situation, MUSIX measurement,
as performed in this study, is of much importance. Reduction
of MUNIX in combination with enlarged MUSIX can provide
evidence of loss of motor units. If MUNIX is reduced with lack
of MUSIX changes, the drop of MUNIX may be either from
actual motor unit loss (without sufficient compensatory muscle
fiber reinnervation) or/and from muscle fiber atrophy [42].
Given the above, it is important to perform a complementary
MUNIX and MUSIX examination to assess the complex neural
and muscular changes after stroke. Our study was performed on
three major hand muscles. It was found that for the tested stroke
subjects the hand CMAP amplitude (as a summation of three
tested muscles) was significantly lower in the paretic side than
the contralateral side. There was a linear correlation between
CMAP and MUNIX values for both paretic and contralateral
hands, which is consistent to previous MUNIX findings [23],
[35]. The hand MUNIX values were found to be significantly
lower in paretic side than in contralateral side. However, it is
worth noting that different findings were observed for each of
the three muscles.
For the FDI muscle, we found that both CMAP and MUNIX
values were significantly reduced in the paretic side compared
with the contralateral side. However, the MUSIX values of the
paretic FDI muscles were smaller than those of the contralateral
FDI muscles. These findings did not provide secure evidence of
spinal motoneuron degeneration for the tested stroke subjects,
because the reduction of MUNIX or CMAP values may be due
to muscle fiber atrophy, and/or actual motor unit (most likely
big motor units) loss without a sufficient compensatory muscle
fiber reinnervation process.
For the APB muscle, it was found that the CMAP and MUNIX
values in the paretic side were lower than those in the contralateral side, whereas the MUSIX value of the paretic side
was higher than the contralateral side. No significant difference
was observed for any of the comparisons. It appears that for

2896

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2014

the tested strokes subjects, compared with the FDI muscle the
APB muscle was less affected in terms of CMAP or MUNIX
measurements. The reduced MUNIX in combination with
slightly enlarged MUSIX values as observed from the paretic
APB muscles provided limited evidence of spinal motoneuron
degeneration after stroke.
For the ADM muscle, it was found that the CMAP values were
reduced in paretic side compared with the contralateral side (p
= 0.05). Surprisingly, the mean MUNIX values were similar
for paretic and contralateral muscles. As a result, the MUSIX
values were smaller in the paretic muscles compared with the
contralateral muscles. We note that the AI of the paretic ADM
muscle was the lowest among all the examined muscles. We
speculate that the dramatically reduced AI is a potential factor
for relatively high MUNIX values of the paretic ADM muscles.
There are different factors that may contribute to muscle AI
reduction including decreased motor unit firing rates and partial
paralysis. In the latter case, motoneurons that are still alive and
have a functional connection to the muscle can be activated by
electrical stimulation, but cannot be activated voluntarily due to
a deficit in descending drive. These motoneurons would make a
contribution to the CMAP, but not to the SIP. Although previous
simulation work suggested that systematic reduction of motor
unit peak firing rates would not have a significant impact on
the MUNIX estimation [42], it is not clear how partial paralysis
might affect the MUNIX estimation. This remains a topic for
further investigation.
In contrast to different observations in MUNIX measurements
for the three tested muscles, consistent findings were obtained
in muscle AI. For all the three muscles, we found that there was
a significant AI reduction in the paretic side, which was approximately 1/3 the values from the contralateral side, among which
the ADM muscle had the most reduced AI. The significantly
lower AI in paretic muscles may be due to reduced motor unit
firing rates as revealed previously [16], [17], and/or inactivation
of part of the motor unit pool (i.e., partial paralysis).
The consistent observation of significantly reduced AI values
in all the three muscles supports that a fundamental influence
of stroke on the neuromuscular system is an impairment in the
ability to voluntarily activate limb muscles not only in acute and
sub-acute patients, but also in chronic patients. Many patients
in this study had stroke more than 10 years ago, yet their AI
reduction is still severely affected.
Although paretic hand MUNIX and muscle AI were significantly lower compared with contralateral hands, we did not find
that relative alterations in these parameters were correlated to
the relative reduction of hand grip strength. There are several
factors that may contribute to this observation. For example, one
factor is diffuse muscle coactivation during grip strength testing
[43]. Besides distal hand muscles, maximum grip strength includes contributions from proximal muscles in the arm, which
were not considered in the current study. Another factor is related to complex neural and muscular changes post stroke, which
may be present in different degrees, influence the measured indices, and compromise their correlation with hand grip strength.
In addition, the parameters in this study were estimated from
each separate muscle; however, the possible impairment of the

coordination of different muscles to generate the maximal grip
strength was not considered [44]. Finally, the technical limitation of the MUNIX measurement should be acknowledged.
For example, only one direction of voluntary contraction was
performed for each tested muscle. For multifunctional muscles,
different contraction tasks may influence MUNIX estimations,
especially for those selectively affected muscles [45].
V. CONCLUSION
This study applied muscle and motor unit indices, derived
from convenient surface EMG and CMAP recordings, for examination of three hand muscles (FDI, APB, and ADM) of
12 stroke subjects. For all the three muscles, consistent findings were observed that there was a significant reduction of
the muscle AI (ratio of the maximum voluntary EMG to the
CMAP) in paretic side compared with contralateral side. In contrast, analysis of the three muscles indicated diverse changes in
MUNIX and MUSIX measurements. Combining the three muscles, the hand CMAP and MUNIX were significantly reduced
in paretic side compared with contralateral side, whereas the
hand MUSIX was not significantly different. The current results provide an evidence of muscle activation deficiency after
stroke, and suggest that there might be varying degree of motor
unit loss or muscle fiber atrophy (or both) in different muscles
after stroke. A primary advantage of these analyses is that they
offer practical benefits because of their noninvasive and convenient character. A limitation of the study is that the current
MUNIX analyses are difficult to differentiate among complex
neuromuscular changes, thus, providing elusive evidence about
spinal motoneuron degeneration after stroke.
