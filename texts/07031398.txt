Abstract—The aim of this paper is to propose a new method for
the better assessment of cytoplasm conductivity, which is critical
to the development of electroporation protocols as well as insight
into fundamental mechanisms underlying electroporation. For this
goal, we propose to use nanosecond electrical pulses to bypass the
complication of membrane polarization and a single cell to avoid
the complication of the application of the “mixing formulas.” Further, by suspending the cell in a low-conductivity medium, it is
possible to force most of the sensing current through the cytoplasm
for a more direct assessment of its conductivity. For proof of principle, the proposed technique was successfully demonstrated on a
Jurkat cell by comparing the measured and modeled currents. The
cytoplasm conductivity was best assessed at 0.32 S/m and it is in
line with the literature. The cytoplasm conductivity plays a key role
in the understanding of the basis mechanism of the electroporation phenomenon, and in particular, a large error in the cytoplasm
conductivity determination could result in a correspondingly large
error in predicting electroporation. Methods for a good estimation
of such parameter become fundamental.

I. INTRODUCTION
N recent years, single-cell microdosimetry models [1]–[4]
providing dosimetric information of the local electric fields
within cellular and subcellular structures are increasingly critical to electroporation of the cell membrane and sensing of
subcellular structures.
For example, electric fields can be used for fast, label-free,
and low-cost characterization of cell morphology and physiology [5]–[7], as well as point-of-care treatments [8]. Moreover,
microdosimetry models turn out to be powerful predictive tools
in cell electroporation for medical applications [9], [10]. In particular, nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) greater than

tens MV/m can be used for cancer treatment, gene therapy, drug
delivery, wound cicatrization, and muscular stimulation [9]–
[13]. Electroporation depends on the transmembrane potential
(TMP) which, during the pulse, increases above a certain threshold (at least 1 V [14]). Therefore, an affordable estimation of
TMP for the plasma as well as internal membranes is crucial to
reliable prediction of effective electroporation. However, since
TMP cannot be readily measured noninvasively, electroporation
protocols, which define the height and width of applied pulses,
can be developed only with the aid of microdosimetry modeling
of TMP.
Most microdosimetry models to date are based on a simplified cell model of only three compartments: the extracellular
medium, the cell membrane, and the cytoplasm. This threelayered approximation is applicable to electroporation with a
focus on the cell membrane so that the collective properties
of subcellular structures can be lumped into “cytoplasm resistance” and “cytoplasm capacitance” sufficient for TMP estimation [3], [4], [10], [14]–[22]. Even when the three-layer cell
model is used, microdosimetry modeling depends critically on
cell morphology and electrical properties [4], [9]. Whereas cell
morphology, such as shape, diameter, and membrane thickness,
can be readily obtained from microscopy or the literature [23],
electrical properties such as the conductivity and permittivity of
different cell components are not readily measurable nor well
established [15], [24]–[27].
Nevertheless, some consistent estimations are available for
the dielectric properties of the cell membrane [28]. Membrane
dielectric dispersive models have also been assessed on simple
synthetic systems, namely liposomes [16], [25], [29] or human
erythrocytes suspension [17].
By contrast, cytoplasm conductivity and permittivity at different frequency ranges are only vaguely known [24], [27], [30]
despite their importance in predicting the electroporation threshold [9], [18], [19], [31]–[33]. In general, inconsistencies exist
between different cell types and physiological states [28]. As a
result, three-layer microdosimetry models often resorted to the
conductivity of simple phosphate buffer saline solution (PBS)
[15], [19], [30], or water with a certain fraction of dissolved
proteins [20], [27], [34]. To date, when regarding the cytoplasm
as a unique compartment, its electrical properties are mainly
assessed through single-cell electrorotation measurement or dielectric spectroscopy of suspensions of many cells. However,
electrorotation tends to be limited by cell damage and measurement speed [27], [35]–[37], whereas dielectric spectroscopy
tends to be complicated by the inverse application of mixing

formulas [28], [38]–[40]. As a result, the reported values of cytoplasm conductivity of the same type of cells can differ by an
order of magnitude [30], [41].
This paper is mainly about improved assessment of cytoplasm
conductivity through a recently developed broadband biochip so
that dielectric spectroscopy can be performed on a single cell
as opposed to a suspension of many cells [6]. In this case, the
cell is suspended between narrowly spaced electrodes in a lowconductivity medium so that the applied current flows mainly
through cytoplasm to allow more accurate comparison between
the spectroscopy measurements and that calculated by microdosimetry models. Additionally, we use as input nsPEFs signals
that are fast enough to short-circuit the membrane capacitance
and to bypass the membrane polarization effects [42]. In any
case, the chosen nsPEF amplitude is too low (1.5 V) for electroporation or conductivity variation during the pulse application.
The present assessment of cytoplasm conductivity is based
on an iterative theoretical/experimental procedure as shown
schematically in Fig. 1. The theoretical and experimental procedures are detailed in Sections II and III, respectively. Briefly,
two-port measurements, in both time and frequency domains,
were first performed on the biochip loaded with a single Jurkat
cell. Measurements in the time domain were based on the input
(V1 (t)) and output (V2 (t)) nsPEF waveforms obtained by using
a sampling oscilloscope. Due to the relatively short electrical
length of the biochip, the voltage at the output port (V2 (t)) of
the biochip could be regarded as the voltage across the Jurkat
cell, i.e., V2 (t) = VELECTRODES (t).
Measurements in frequency domain were based on scattering
parameters, S11 and S21 , obtained by using a microwave network analyzer. The measured scattering parameters allowed the
shunt current across the cell IM EASURED (f ) to be estimated
from VELECTRODES (t). Finally, theoretical analysis based on
the equivalent circuit model of a cell was performed and the

calculated current across the equivalent circuit IM ODELED (f ),
in response to an ideal pulse with similar characteristics of
VELECTRODES (t), in term of rise/fall times and duration, was
compared with IM EASURED (f ) to estimate the cytoplasm conductivity (σCYT ). The actual results are presented in Section IV,
which is followed by conclusions in Section V.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
A. Preparation of Jurkat Cells
For proof of principle, cytoplasm conductivity of Jurkat (immortalized T-lymphocyte) cells was assessed. Jurkat cells were
chosen due to their size (diameter ∼ 6 μm) [23], robustness,
simple structure, spherical morphology, and nonadherent nature. The cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in SigmaAldrich’s RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 unit/ml
penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After removal from the
culture with trypsin enzyme, the cells were resuspended in 8.5%
sucrose (plus 0.3% dextrose) or 10 × diluted PBS buffer. The
low conductivity of these media (see Table I) minimizes electrode polarization [43] as well as the leakage around the cell.
Although these media may have different long-term effects on
cell vitality, they have similarly low conductivities and resulted
in similar cytoplasm conductivities as shown in Section IV-B,
which underscores the robustness of the present cytoplasm assessment method. To check cell viability, Trypan Blue dye was
used in a separate experiment to confirm that approximately half
of the cells survived after 10 h.
B. Electrical Measurements
The biochip (see Fig. 2) used in two-port electrical measurements was based on a coplanar waveguide (CPW) intercepted by
a microfluidic channel, which was described in details elsewhere

[6]. As discussed in [44] and demonstrated in [45] and [46], the
CPW is a propagating structure suitable to perform real-time in
vitro experiments during the electromagnetic exposure. The input and output ports of the CPW were terminated in SMA coaxial connectors attached to opposite edges of a quartz substrate,
which transparency allowed real-time cell monitoring on an inverted microscope [see Fig. 2(b)] [47]. Fig. 2(c) shows schematically that the CPW is formed by 2-μm-thick, 60-μm-wide, and
10-μm-apart gold electrodes plated on the quartz substrate, with
the spacing between the electrodes used to trap and expose the
cell. (To show details within the electrode spacing, only part
of the width of the electrodes is depicted in Fig. 2(c) and (d).)
The microfluidic channel, 20-μm-wide and 20-μm-high, was
etched in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cover before it was
attached orthogonally to the CPW. Through the microfluidic
channel, Jurkat cells were delivered at a controlled rate then
trapped individually [48] on the CPW mainly by using a 1.5-V,
100-kHz dielectrophoresis signal from an HP 8657B signal generator connected to the biochip through a bias-T (see Fig. 1). The
wavy layout of the electrodes mechanically aided cell trapping.
The setup for electrical measurements in both time and
frequency domains is schematically outlined in the boxes of
Fig. 1. The time-domain setup consisted of an HP 8110A pulse

generator, a broadband divider with 50-Ω input/output
impedances, and an Agilent 86100A sampling oscilloscope.
The broadband divider allowed the input and output waveforms,
V1 (t) and V2 (t) = VELECTRODES (t), to be sampled on the oscilloscope every 0.07 ns. Trapezoidal monopolar and bipolar
pulses of 1.5-V height, 20-ns width, and 4-ns rise/fall times
were used as V1 (t) [49]. Both polarities were used due to their
different low-frequency contents in order to test the robustness
of our assessment of σCYT .
The biochip with the cell trapped was also measured in the
frequency domain. As depicted in Fig. 1 the setup was based on
an Agilent 5230A performance network analyzer (PNA), which
allowed reflected and transmitted scattering parameters S11 and
S21 of the loaded biochip to be measured from 10 MHz to
2 GHz. Before connecting the biochip to the PNA trough SMA
connectors [see Fig. 2(a), (b)], the PNA was calibrated by the
standard full two-port short-open-load-thru calibration procedure [50] with Agilent 85052B 3.5-mm impedance standards.
The calibration moved the reference plane from the PNA to
the SMA by deembedding the effects of the cables and connectors in between. During the S-parameter acquisition, the
PNA was set to acquire 401 frequency points with a 5-Hz
intermediate-frequency filter to ensure measurement accuracy.
The biochip, with its biological load, is well matched to the 50Ω system impedance, and hence, the measured VELECTRODES
signal maintains an ideal trapezoidal shape as V1 (t) (see Fig. 3).
C. Calculation of Shunt Current
The measured S11 and S21 parameters in the frequency
domain were used to calculate the shunt current through the
trapped Jurkat cell IM EASURED (f ) from the measured voltage

where I1 (f ) and I2 (f ) are currents flowing into the input and
output ports, respectively, of the biochip, V2 (f ) is the Fourier
transform of V2 (t), and Z0 is the 50-Ω system impedance. Finally, IM EASURED (f ) can be compared with IM ODELED (f ) to
assess σCYT as described by Fig. 1.
D. Uncertainty Analysis
The uncertainty on IM EASURED (f ) was evaluated from the
type-B uncertainties on the measured V2 (t), S11 (f ), and S21 (f )
according to the specifications of the oscilloscope and the PNA.
As required when dealing with complex numbers [52], the uncertainties were propagated on the real and imaginary parts of
(1)–(3), assuming Re(S11 ), Im(S11 ), Re(S21 ), and Im(S21 ) are
perfectly correlated. This is usually the case when considering
systematic errors [53]. The uncertainties on the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform of V2 (t) were calculated
to be inversely proportional to N, the total number of measurement points in the time domain [54]. The standard uncertainty
(δJ2 ) at each frequency point (J) was provided as input to the
least-mean-square estimation procedure of σCYT .
III. MODELING
Fig. 4 shows the equivalent circuit of the cell: cytoplasm,
cell membrane, and extracellular medium, with each component

represented by a parallel Ri − Ci subcircuit [18], where Ri =
2
di
2
σ i [Ωm ]; Ci = ε0 εsi /di [F/m ]; ε0 is the vacuum permittivity;
di , εsi , and σi are the physical dimension, static permittivity
and conductivity, respectively, of each compartment [42], with
the subscript i equal to EXTRA for the extracellular medium, M
for the membrane, and CYT for the cytoplasm.
To account for the current flowing around the cell, a parallel
path for the extracellular medium (CEP , REP ) is added [31]. The
cell membrane is assumed to be 10-nm thick with previously
proposed dispersionless conductivity and permittivity. Since the
nsPEF is longer than 10 ns [18], dispersion should have little
effect on these electrical properties. Table I lists the dimension
and electrical properties of the different components and the
related references. Using the values listed in Table I, the R–
C subcircuit for each component was evaluated considering the
formulations in [18]. The calculated values are listed in Table II.
The previously described equivalent circuit is used to extract
the admittance in frequency domain (see the modeling part in
Fig. 1). In particular

where for each compartment the impedance is given by the
parallel R–C subcircuit so that Zi = Ri /(1 + jωRi Ci ) with
ω being the angular frequency. ZES is based on 2-μm length,
which is half of the difference between electrode spacing and
cell diameter. ZEP is simply a spreading impedance. ZCYT is a
function of σCYT .
IV. RESULTS
A. Simulated Current Distribution
Using the cell characteristics listed in Table I, 2-D electromagnetic simulations were used to evaluate the current spreading through and around the cell, and hence, the effectiveness of
a low-conductivity medium.
The simulations were carried out by using the AC–DC electric
current module of COMSOL Multiphysics v. 4.3. The electrodes
were placed on the top and bottom of the 20 μm × 10 μm simulation domain. Continuity conditions were placed at the inner
boundaries. Fig. 5(a) plots the simulated current between the

electrodes (ITOTAL (t)) and the portion through the cytoplasm
(ICYT (t)) against extracellular conductivity ranging from 0.01
to 1 S/m. In either case, the cytoplasm conductivity is fixed
at the lower value of 0.1 S/m [30], the current is sampled at
10 ns, approximately the middle of the 22-ns-wide nsPEF. It
can be seen that for σEXTRA ∼ 0.05 S/m (close to the two low
conductivities used here), the two currents are almost equal.
This demonstrates that the current flows mainly through the
cytoplasm so that the total ITOTAL (t) is mainly governed by
the cytoplasm conductivity as mentioned in Section I. By contrast, for higher σEXTRA values, ITOTAL (t) is mainly governed
by the extracellular conductivity. This is further evidenced by
comparing the current distributions for a Jurkat cell suspended
in sucrose (σEXTRA = 0.056 S/m [55]) and non-diluted PBS
(σEXTRA = 0.55 S/m [25]), respectively. Fig. 5(b) and (c) plots
these distributions sampled at 10 ns and normalized with respect
to their minimum values. These results validate the choice of the
present test setup with the low-conductive extracellular media.
B. Optimized Cytoplasm Conductivity

To assess the cytoplasm conductivity, a nonlinear leastsquare fitting algorithm (Trust Region) in MATLAB R2013b
is used. The algorithm estimates σCYT by comparing the
modeled current (IM ODELED (f )) and the measured current
(IM EASURED (f )), including the measurement uncertainties discussed in Section II-D.
To obtain the analytical formulation of the modeled current,
we considered ideal trapezoidal signals both monopolar and
bipolar with amplitude Δe, duration τ (when the pulse is above
50% of its maximum), and rise/fall times τR /τF , similar to
that used in the experiment. This way, the nsPEF pulse can be
expressed in time domain as a sum of four straight lines with

experimental data have been taken into account by means of
a weighted estimation procedure, with the weights equal to the
inverse of the uncertainties (wJ = 1/δJ2 ) of the data at each
frequency.
The same fitting procedure was repeated eight times for the
real and imaginary parts of the current under different combinations of pulse types (monopolar and bipolar) and media (sucrose
and 10 × diluted PBS). Fig. 6 shows an example for fitting the
real part of the current under a monopolar pulse in sucrose,
which resulted in σCYT = 0.32 S/m. It can be seen that the fit
is all within the error bars of the measured data. Similarly good
fits were obtained for all other cases.
The eight estimated σCYT values with their standard deviations (μ) have been combined by using the maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) method [56]. The weighted mean value is
given by

and the standard deviation of the weighted mean is

(11)

where σCYTi is the estimated value for each measurement
and μi is the standard deviation associated with these values. The MLE procedure gives the final cytoplasm conductivity value of 0.321 S/m with a low standard deviation of 0.012
S/m. This optimized value is rounded to the second decimal

σCYT = 0.32 S/m, the result gives rise to simulated currents in
time domain in very good agreement with all the four measured
currents as shown in Fig. 7. The proposed method is completely
general but obviously the model values adopted here are specific of our experiment (dimensions of the cell, conductivity
of the medium, etc.) and should be conveniently adapted when
considering different experimental choices.

V. CONCLUSION
In order to assess cytoplasm conductivity, we used nanosecond pulses to bypass the complication of membrane polarization
and a single cell to avoid the complication of the inverse application of the “mixing formulas”. Further, by suspending the cell
in a low-conductivity medium, it is possible to force most of the
sensing current through cytoplasm for a more direct measurement of cytoplasm conductivity.
Using the previously described assessment technique, the best
estimated value for the cytoplasm conductivity of Jurkat cells
was 0.32 S/m. This value, while in line with the literature, is only
half of the saline conductivity assumed in many microdosimetry
models [15]. Such a large error in cytoplasm conductivity could
result in a correspondingly large error in predicting the electroporation threshold. Given the variety of nsPEF waveforms
used in electroporation, the improved accuracy in predicting the
electroporation threshold would be useful in the development
of electroporation protocols as well as insight into fundamental
mechanisms underlying electroporation.
