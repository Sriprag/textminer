Responses Against Cancer
J. F. Bai, Member, IEEE, P. Liu, and L. X. Xu∗ , Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—In the past decades, techniques for tumor diagnosis
and treatment have been significantly advanced. However, the fiveyear survival rate of cancer patients remains low. New modalities
are highly desirable based on technology innovation and translational medicine. In this paper, recent outcomes of thermal ablation
techniques are reviewed, including thermal energy delivery methods, thermally induced immune responses in depth. It is suggested
that the synergy of local thermal ablation and thermally induced
whole body immune response could be a promising direction for
effective cancer therapy in the near future, especially for highly
metastatic tumor.
Index Terms—Cryothermal treatment, immune response,
metastatic tumor, thermal ablation.

I. INTRODUCTION
HE incidence of cancer and its mortality remains high despite of the advancement of medical technologies in the
past two decades [1]–[4]. Among common treatments for cancer
including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery is
the primary treatment option for most solid tumors. Although,
chemotherapy has been proven useful in treating many different types of cancer, especially with distant metastases, the side
effects of the whole body toxicity limit its applications. Recent
development in targeted therapy has made some improvement.
Ionizing radiation therapy has also been widely applied for cancer treatment, and sometimes, in conjunction to gene therapy [5].
Nevertheless, the 5-year survival rate of cancer patients at all
stages still remains very low [6].
Alternatively, the use of physical modalities (i.e., light, ultrasound, electromagnetic field), such as radio frequency (RF),
microwave (MW), high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU),

laser and cryosurgery, have become important complementary
cancer treatment methods. These technologies possess advantages of minimal invasion, local targeting, and less side effect,
which can be used in combination with other modalities. In
thermal treatment of cancer, navigated local power delivery is
expected to provide precisely controlled in situ cancer damage
and effective therapeutic outcome. The mechanism of thermal
techniques lies in the local induction of cancer cells death by
necrosis or apoptosis depending on the intensity of local heat and
exposure time, namely the thermal dosage. Quantification methods of the thermal effect on the tumor cell and vasculature have
been developed and reviewed in detail by He and Bischoff [7].
In 2007, Habash et al. [8] gave a comprehensive summary of
thermal ablation techniques and clinical applications. Therapeutic hyperthermia (<50 ◦ C) enhanced radio chemotherapy was
shown to be beneficial for local cancer control and increased
survival of patients through phase II/III clinical trials [9]. Regarding these techniques, the major concerns include the lack of
real time in situ monitoring of target tissue ablation, navigation,
standard measure of clinical efficacy, etc.
In this paper, recent development of thermal ablation techniques for cancer treatment are reviewed and compared with
the emphasis on thermal energy delivery methods, thermally
stimulated immunological responses.
II. ADVANCEMENT IN ENERGY DELIVERY METHODS OF
THERMAL TREATMENT
In thermal treatment, local temperature is either raised or lowered to destroy abnormal tissue or restore normal functioning
through focused energy delivery. During the treatment, conformal thermal ablation (>60 ◦ C) of the target tissue can be
achieved by controlling local temperature distribution and exposure time via precisely configured energy delivery. HIFU,
RF, MW, laser or cryogenic fluids are commonly used as energy
sources, and the target delivery is the key to success. A comparison of different thermal treatment techniques is summarized in
Table I.
A. New Probes of RF, MW, Laser, and Cryosurgery Ablation
In the past decade, RF, MW, laser, and cryosurgery ablation therapy were used to achieve significant clinical outcomes
along with the development of image-guided technologies. Irreversible tissue necrosis can be caused by high temperatures
between 50 and 100 ◦ C or low temperatures in the range of
−60 to −80 ◦ C. In a comprehensive review by Vogl et al. [10],

TABLE I
TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THE MAIN THERMAL ABLATION MODALITIES

clinical studies and technical considerations in the thermal treatment of primary and metastatic pulmonary neoplasms were presented. New translational techniques of novel probes combined
with image guidance are discussed as follows.
Although the basic principle of RF and MW antenna for thermal treatment remains similar, extensive research has been performed on changing from the hydrocooling to gas cooling [11],
on short single traveling-wave structure [12], double or treble
needles structure [13] and antenna array [14], new material for
better biocompatibility and MR-compatible [15]–[18], electromagnetic tracking mark equipped to automatic precise navigation [19], coupling with numerical simulations [20]–[23]. There
are also some new investigations of cryoprobes. Qi et al. [24],
[25] studied single-phase pressure drop, two-phase flow instability, and heat transfer characteristics of turbulent liquid nitrogen
flow in microtubes with the diameters of 0.531, 0.834, 1.042,
and 1.931 mm. The flow and heat transfer characteristics of liquid nitrogen in the microtubes were investigated experimentally,
for the purpose of developing a more effective and minimally
invasive cryoprobe to facilitate liquid nitrogen cooling in deep
tissue. A new boiling heat transfer experiment was designed
to develop an ultrafine cryoprobe, consisting of a glass pipe
(1.2-mm inner diameter, 2-mm outer diameter) and a nylon
inner tube in 2010 [26]. New modality was proposed to use critical point of nitrogen to provide lethal cooling through smaller
probes, and it might be more effective than the Joule–Thomsonbased systems [27]. Compared with the traditional cryoprobes in
which liquid nitrogen or argon–helium is used as cooling fluid,
the new method of thermoelectric cooling (TEC) technology
which utilizes the Peltier effect has been developed for future
clinical applications [28]. In the prototype system, TEC module
was made from bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) with a hot side area
of 16 cm2 and a cold side area of 0.25 cm2 , driven by an electric
voltage of 12 V, and the lowest cold side temperatures for two
different modules were 187 and 177 K, respectively.

B. HIFU-Phased Array
As one of the major noninvasive physical therapy techniques,
HIFU has caught a great attention of research and clinical applications for several decades [29]–[31]. In HIFU treatment,
ultrasonic beams emitted from a high-power transducer are focused on the targeted area inside the body, and temperatures
within the focal volume are normally raised to over 65 ◦ C in
several seconds to cause tissue coagulation. Nevertheless, there
still exist some limitations hindering its clinical applications,
i.e., beam propagation in heterogeneous tissues [32], poor estimation of the exposure level in situ [33], long treatment duration
for large and deeply situated tumors [34]–[36], less effective in
respiration-sensitive organs [37], [38], etc. The phased arrays
technique developed in 1998 is expected to better control the
ultrasound power and to improve the beam penetration in tissue.
Phased arrays of HIFU are driven with signals of proper phase
differences to obtain a common focal point (electrical focusing)
and the phased scanning technology. HIFU with phased arrays
possess advantages over traditional HIFU, i.e., much faster electronic scanning of real time multifoci to significantly reduce the
treatment time, especially for large tumors, and easily adaptive
to the merge of MRI for image guided operation [39]. Fig. 1
illustrates the principles of HIFU-phased array technology.
In the last decade, progression in technologies of HIFU with
phased arrays includes the design of phased-array transducer
(calculation of phased ultrasound fields, phased signals, and
power parameters), the focus-phased control strategy, image
guide methods, etc. [40]–[42]. Frequency is a key parameter
used in the design of the phased-array transducer, and in the
determination of the system function as it is applied to different
organs. In general, the high frequency (>500 KHz) is used
in thermal ablation, while low frequency (200–500 KHz) for
cavitation, which could be used to open the blood brain barrier.
In the study of the focus-phased control strategy, heating time,

scanning path, and the field of target are key parameters. In
2010, Song et al. [43] used lateral mode coupling method for
the calculation of the large scale ultrasound phased array, which
was consisting of 1372 cylindrical piezoelectric elements (each
element had a 10-mm outer diameter, 6-mm height, and 1.2-mm
wall thickness), driven at the low (306 KHz) or high frequency
(840 KHz). The maximum acoustic average surface intensity
generated was 27 W/cm2 .
Phased arrays, in which each transducer is driven by voltage
in different phase to produce a specified focal pattern (single
focus/multiple foci), are usually used to improve the focusing
ability of HIFU technology, namely electrical focusing. The
Chen’s team has endeavored to investigate the HIFU-phased
array technology in clinical applications since 2000. They are
currently developing HIFU-phased array systems with MRI/US
guidance. They also proposed many kinds of prototypes of
phased arrays and its controlling strategy for US-compatible or
MR-compatible systems [32], [34]–[36], [44], [45]. The multiple foci mode (110–196 elements at 1.6 MHZ based on a large
hemispherical case with radius of curvature from 14 to 18 cm)
is used to generate fast switching pattern for target ablation. Experimental results showed that the treatment time was reduced
by 20% as compared with the static multifoci mode. It is feasible to use their system for an effective treatment of large and
deeply situated tumors by optimizing the in situ exposure level
and beam propagation in heterogeneous tissues.
In 2012, Song et al. [46] also investigated the standing-wave
formation and focus scanning strategy in human skull based
on large-aperture-phased array of InSightec system (Exablate
4000), which was composed of MR-compatible, 30-cm diameter, radius of curvature of 15 cm, 1011-element hemispherical
ultrasound phased array driven at 230 KHz. This is the latest attempt to develop a new HIFU modality that could be applied to
human brain. The potential of HIFU with phased arrays for clinical use has been enhanced greatly by the integration of HIFU
technology and MRI guidance over the last five years. Several
comprehensive reviews on clinical applications of HIFU are
given in [39], [47], and [48]. Besides its current application in the

treatment of uterine fibroids, targeted drug delivery [49], [50],
blood-brain barrier disruption [51], [52], and trans-rib treatment
in abdominal organs [53], [54], neurological diseases [55]–[57]
are among its potential applications in the near future.
III. THERMALLY INDUCED IMMUNE RESPONSE
Thermal treatment of cancer is not only applied as an effective modality for noninvasive or minimal invasive ablation
of primary tumor but also found as a stimulus to immune response. Many studies highlighted the fact that thermal treatment
protocol was critical in the evaluation of the therapeutic effect.
As a dominant parameter of thermal treatment, temperature acts
as a sensitive regulator during the treatment. The role of raised
temperature from normal body temperature in the regulation
of immune response should be paid more attention [58]. Accumulating evidence indicates mild-to-moderate hyperthermia
range (38–42 ◦ C) could not kill the tumor cells directly, but also
increase the immunogenicity of tumor cells and modulate the
activities of immune cells, including APCs, T cells, and NK cells
[58]–[60], acting as a sensitizer for radiation therapy or chemotherapy as demonstrated in numerous clinical studies [61], [62].
Hyperthermia with cytotoxic temperature (>43 ◦ C) was found
to ablate tumor cells directly, releasing tumor antigen load for
the induction of an antitumor immune response [59], [60]. In
some clinic reports, there was much evidence suggesting the immune modulatory effect of RF ablation. For example, after RF
ablation, circulating CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells
(Treg) was decreased [63], percentages of activated T cells and
circulating NK cells were increased in patients [64]–[66]. In
comparison, during other thermoablative treatments using MW,
HIFU and laser, only few reports were found to observe the
immunomodulatory.
While thermal ablation was mostly described to stimulate immune responses to certain degree, cryoablation was observed to
be both stimulatory and suppressive on the immune response.
Some works reported that cryoablation might mediate induction of immunosuppressive responses to delay the development

1500

of antitumor immunity to promote metastasis [67]–[69]. In contrast, other studies demonstrated cryoablation activated immune
response [70]–[75]. Sabel et al. summarized that the immune
response induced by cryoablation was dependent on several
factors including 1) tumor type, 2) the frozen method, 3) the
volume of frozen tumor tissue, and 4) the time point of immunomonitoring [76]. Others also reported that the cryoablation
technique and rate of freezing cycles could influence the mechanistic division between immunosuppression and immunostimulation [74], [76].
So far, the mechanisms of thermally induced immune response are still not clear. Some studies indicated that it was
dependent on the mechanism of cell death [59], [60], [76]. The
modes of cell death, i.e., necrotic cells and apoptotic cells, could
activate an inflammatory response in different ways [77]. Necrosis is characterized by cellular breakdown, disruption of tissue
architecture, the release of the nuclear protein high mobility
group box-1 (HMGB1), and heat shock proteins (HSPs) associated with proinflammatory cytokine function [78]–[80]. Extracellular HSPs derived from tumor cells released by cell necrosis
or cellular stress have been regarded as potent adjuvant facilitating presentation of tumor Ags and induction of antitumor
immunity. HMGB1 is a nuclear protein associated with cancer
progression. An elevated expression of HMGB1 was observed
in primary breast cancers [81], [82]. The HMGB1 protein could
be passively released by damaged or necrotic cells, once released, HMGB1 was capable of activating other cells involved
in immune response [83]. Previous studies have shown that
releasable HSP70 and HMGB1 could be detected 30 min after
thermal treatment [84], [85]. In contrast, apoptotic cells not only
prevented the release of the intracellular contents, but inhibited
proinflammatory cytokine release and increase TGF-β1 production, then suppressed the resultant immune response [86], [87].
So the amount of necrosis versus the amount of apoptosis associated with thermal tissue damage might be a determinant to
strong or weak and positive or negative immune response induced by thermal treatment. The extent of necrosis is related to
the thermal dose, and changes of thermal dose might alter the
ratio of necrotic and apoptotic cells, and cause vascular damage
which result in ischaemic necrosis and further the coagulative
necrosis in the tumor [88]–[93]. It would finally affect the released tumor antigens within the tumor microenvironment, thus
alter the immune response to tumor antigens.
Based on the experimental observations, thermal treatment induces tumor necrosis in situ that releases various tumor antigens,
stimulates inflammatory reactions and the recruitment and activation of immune effector cells in damaged tumor tissue. Subsequent activation of antitumor adaptive immunity, including
CD4+, CD8+ T cells could contribute to local tumor elimination, and control distant micrometastases [72], [75], [94], [95].
Besides, the removal of tumor tissue leads to overcome immunosuppression immunity shifting the balance toward effective antitumor immunity [96]–[98]. Heat-induced cytotoxicity varies
with temperature, and a stronger cytotoxic effect might create
an antigen source for the induction of an antitumor immune
response [99]. However, it should be noted that these reported
effects of antitumor immunity induced by thermoablation as a

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MAY 2014

monotherapy was short lasting and too weak in long-term inhibition of tumor recurrence and metastases. In cryoablation,
the amount of necrosis versus the amount of apoptosis depends
on the rate of freezing, number of freeze–thaw cycles, and size
of the cryolesion. If cryoablative techniques resulted in large
areas of apoptotic cell death, as opposed to necrosis, it might induce immunosuppression [76]. Notably, in order to enhance
tumor-specific immune response, combined therapies strategies, such as anti-CTLA-4 mAb, Treg depletion [72], [100], dc
vaccination [101] or application of adjuvants (tumor necrosis
factor-a (TNF-a) [102]–[108], interleukins [107], [109]–[111],
or chemokines, GM-CSF [112], toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists [113]–[115], immunostimulant [116]) thermal treatment
were showed improvement in tumor control. On the other hand,
in thermal treatment itself, developing the appropriate thermoablative method and finding optimal parameters of treatment
will be an exciting area of study.
In 2007, Zhong’s team [117] used HIFU exposure system
(focal length of 63 mm and frequency at 3.3 MHz) with
B-mode guidance to demonstrate that HIFU treatment could
elicit the systemic antitumor immune response which was
closely related to dendritic cell activation. They suggested that
a synergistic combination of HIFU-induced thermal ablation
(continuous wave mode at a comparatively low pressure level,
focal temperature increased rapidly to greater than 70 ◦ C within
a 3 s) for treating the primary tumor mass and HIFU-elicited
mechanical therapy (burst mode with a duty cycle of 2% and a
higher pressure level, focal temperature increased slowly to less
than 55 ◦ C within a 30 s) for combating residual and metastatic
tumor cells through creating a large amount of tumor lysis by
combined thermal and mechanical stress.
Further mechanistic study has been performed by Xu’s team
on thermally induced immune response against metastatic tumor using animal model since 2005. They reported a series of
work on attempts to develop a synergistic cryothermal treatment modality for metastatic tumor through induction of long
lasting and strong whole body immune response [118]–[124]. A
new system aiming for more effective thermal treatment of tumor was built to facilitate liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling and RF
heating in tissue simultaneously or alternately. Their experimental results showed that through only one cycle of rapid cooling
followed by heating, the damage region was significantly increased and the greatest extent of tumor cells necrosis, rather
than apoptosis, was induced directly under strong mechanical
stress in a mild temperature range used, which could not be
achieved by either the cooling or heating treatment alone. In the
animal experimental study, a new flat probe was designed for
treating the subcutaneous 4T1 mouse tumor. It was found that
the cryothermal treatment (cooling at –20 ◦ C for 5 min, followed
by heating at 50 ◦ C for 10 min) was very effective against highly
metastatic breast cancer and local tumor recurrence. Good therapeutic effect and antitumor effect induced by the cryothermal
treatment were likely attributed to the following reasons. First,
the cryothermal treatment induced substantial damage to tumor vasculature, which plays a very important role in tumor
growth, metastasis, and recurrence. Second, the cryothermal
treatment induced a great extent of tumor necrosis and released

both danger signals and antigenic peptides, which could act
on the activation and maturation of DCs [125]. Thus, necrotic
antigen exposure in the “danger” signals might make the residual tumor cells more vulnerable to CTL-mediated killing [126].
Third, the cryothermal treatment induced a great extent of “danger” environment at the tumor site that promoted homing of the
most lymphocytes to the tumor, which might induce sufficient
functional effector T cells [125]. Lastly but probably the most
important, the cryothermal treatment was found to reduce immune suppression cells accumulation such as MDSCs, TAMs,
and T-regs in tumor tissues, blood circulation, and spleen. Fig. 2
summarizes the possible mechanisms of synergistic cryothermal
immunologic effect on metastatic tumor.
In comparison, though hyperthermia could generate amounts
of tumor debris as potential antigenic peptides complexes for
the induction of antitumor immunity [127]–[129], the extent of
tumor necrosis was found lower than that by the cryothermal
treatment. Moreover, hyperthermia could not reduce immune
suppression cells accumulation in the tumor, spleen, and blood
circulation as to the extent by the cryothermal treatment. Thus,
the antitumor immune response induced was not enough to eliminate the residual tumor cells and prevent tumor recurrence. On
the other hand, hyperthermia induced less damage in tumor
angiogenesis, which might increase the risk for the unkilled tumor cells transport and cause distant metastasis. Cryosurgery
normally induces large amounts of apoptotic cells that might
actively render antigen-presenting cells into an immunosuppressive state [78].
Through the local cryothermal treatment in a short duration,
tumor cells and microcirculations were raptured in situ by large
thermal and mechanical stresses, releasing large amount of tumor antigens and factors to stimulate strong and long-lasting
antitumor immunologic response to prevent the local tumor
recurrence and inhibit metastasis than either the cooling or
heating treatment alone. Moreover, the cryothermal treatment
combined with immunomodulating strategies are expected to

further enhance antitumor immunologic response to treat highly
metastatic cancer effectively.
IV. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
Thermal ablation techniques present promising approaches to
tumor treatment because of its recent advances in precise energy
delivery and real-time monitoring, its non- or minimal invasiveness, and more importantly the possible whole body immune
response through thermally induced depletion of immune suppression cells and in situ release of tumor specific antigens. It has
been recognized lately that the aggregation of immune suppression cells induced by cancer growths is the key hurdle in cancer
treatment, especially for metastatic cancer. In contrast to the
current conventional approaches, the concept of using the minimal external intervention to stimulate the maximal self-defense
in body for the complete cure is revolutionary. Such kind of
treatment modality is based on the synergistic effect that could
be only achieved through interdisciplinary research across the
boundaries of biology, physics, engineering, and translational
medicine. There were famous words of Hippocrates (479-377
B.C.): Those who cannot be cured by medicine can be cured by
surgery. Those who cannot be cured by surgery can be cured
by fire. Those who cannot be cured by fire, they are indeed
incurable. What it really implies is that the cure of disease ultimately lies in nature, namely self-cure and self-repair. In light
of this, application of less toxic local thermal treatment to mechanically break down primary cancer cells and to induce whole
body immune response against distal metastases could be further developed to become an effective treatment for metastatic
tumor in the near future.
