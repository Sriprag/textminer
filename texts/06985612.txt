Abstract—Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD) is a common degenerative condition leading to a severe impairment of gait.
There is currently no effective method to determine whether a patient with advanced PTTD would benefit from several months of
bracing and physical therapy or ultimately require surgery. Tendon
degeneration is closely associated with irreversible degradation of
its collagen structure, leading to changes to its mechanical properties. If these properties could be monitored in vivo, they could be
used to quantify the severity of tendonosis and help determine the
appropriate treatment. The goal of this cadaveric study was, therefore, to develop and validate ultrasound elasticity imaging (UEI)
as a potentially noninvasive technique for quantifying tendon mechanical properties. Five human cadaver feet were mounted in a
materials testing system (MTS), while the posterior tibial tendon
(PTT) was attached to a force actuator. A portable ultrasound scanner collected 2-D data during loading cycles. Young’s modulus was
calculated from the strain, loading force, and cross-sectional area of
the PTT. Average Young’s modulus for the five tendons was (0.45 ±
0.16 GPa) using UEI, which was consistent with simultaneous measurements made by the MTS across the whole tendon (0.52 ±
0.18 GPa). We also calculated the scaling factor (0.12 ± 0.01) between the load on the PTT and the inversion force at the forefoot, a
measurable quantity in vivo. This study suggests that UEI could be
a reliable in vivo technique for estimating the mechanical properties of the PTT, and as a clinical tool, help guide treatment decisions
for advanced PTTD and other tendinopathies.

phase of gait. It is highly susceptible to overuse injury and degeneration, leading to an acquired flatfoot deformity and difficulty
with ambulation. Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD)
is especially common in women over 40 years of age with an
incidence of 3.3% [1].
The pathophysiology of PTTD involves localized tendon degeneration behind the medial malleolus, where the tendon experiences maximal stress and poor blood supply [2]. It is thought
that irreversible degradation of collagen structure leads to
lengthening of the tendon, change in mechanical properties [3],
and eventually a collapse of the medial longitudinal arch. Several studies have confirmed the link between tendinopathy and
changes in the elastic properties of tendon [4]–[6]. One study
of Achilles tendinopathy reported a 51% decrease in Young’s
modulus (1.67–0.82 GPa) of the Achilles tendon as compared
to healthy controls [7]. Another found that strength training for
the Achilles in the elderly led to a 69% increase in Young’s
modulus (1.3–2.2 GPa) [8].
Stage II PTTD (flexible flatfoot deformity) is often treated
with surgery using tendon transfer to restore inversion power
and osteotomies (reshaping of the bones) to reconstruct the
arch and restore proper alignment of the heel. However, recent
studies suggest that 60–90% of these patients respond to nonoperative treatment consisting of bracing and physical therapy
for 3–6 months [9]–[14]. Moreover, many of these patients (33–
70%) were able to resume normal gait and become brace free.
However, there is no reliable method to predict which patients
will do well with conservative care and which will ultimately
require surgery [15]. This has led to prolonged unsuccessful
conservative treatment in some patients and premature surgical intervention in others. Thus, there is a great need for an
objective evidence-based tool to evaluate the PTT, help classify advanced-stage PTTD, determine its prognosis, and inform
treatment decisions. Unfortunately, a noninvasive clinical tool
for quantifying a tendon’s mechanical properties does not currently exist.
To overcome this limitation, we propose ultrasound elasticity imaging (UEI) as a noninvasive technique for quantifying
the stiffness and elastic properties of the PTT. UEI consists
of acquiring a sequence of ultrasound frames and applying
speckle tracking to estimate displacement and strain at each
pixel [16]–[24]. The technique is FDA approved for diagnostic
breast imaging and classifying suspicious lesions based on the
strain pattern, leading to a reduction of unnecessary biopsies
[25]. Other clinical applications include assessing contractility

and strain deficiencies in the myocardium and quantifying mechanical properties of tissue-engineered implants [26]–[31].
Several recent studies have implemented UEI to quantify the
mechanical properties of human skeletal muscle and tendon
(electrically stimulated or under load) [4], [32]–[40]. However,
none of these studies employed elasticity imaging to quantify
differences in tendon mechanical properties associated with degeneration or rehabilitation.
The primary goal of this project was to develop and validate
the UEI technique of the human PTT using a cadaver model
and to obtain baseline estimates of its mechanical properties. A
secondary goal was to determine the relationship between the
tensile force applied to the PTT and the corresponding inversion
force generated at the forefoot, which is a measurable parameter
for future in vivo experiments. The long-term goal was to create
a quantitative in vivo test that can be employed clinically for
grading degenerative tendon diseases, aiding in prognosis, and
helping guide treatment decisions.
II. METHODS
Five thawed human cadaver feet from male and female donors
aged from 68 to 92 years were transected midleg, potted in
a Cerrobend pot, and mounted in a materials testing system
(MTS, Model 810 Systems Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN).
The proximal portion of the PTT was dissected free from the
muscle, whipstitched with high strength suture, and attached via
a steel cable to a load cell mounted on an actuator (see Fig. 1).
The exposed portion was wrapped with gauze soaked in saline
to prevent desiccation.
A commercial 14-MHz linear array ultrasound probe (L14–5,
Zonare Medical Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA) was positioned over the PTT adjacent to the medial malleolus. This
portion of the tendon was chosen because it is most vulnerable
to degeneration and most often affected by PTTD. The probe
was connected to a portable ultrasound scanner (zOneUltra,
Zonare Medical Systems) controlled by a PC running MATLAB
(Mathworks Inc.) to acquire ultrasound frame data (both amplitude and phase) at a rate of 50 Hz for 6 s. The ultrasound

probe was held by an experienced sonographer with its long
axis aligned parallel to the PTT.
A preload of 10 N was applied to maintain the tendon under
tension. The specimen was then subjected to three load–unload
cycles. Each cycle lasted for 5 s, during which the axial force
was gradually increased from preload to 588 N (60 kg, approximating the weight of an adult female), and the tendon was then
allowed to return to preload. Inversion force measurements were
obtained during the trial from a second load cell that abutted the
medial aspect of the first metatarsal head. Stroke of the actuator,
representing the displacement of the proximal end of the PTT,
was recorded by the MTS machine.
Transverse B-mode images were used to determine the crosssectional area (CSA), denoted as A, of each PTT. The boundary
of the tendon was traced three times at three different locations (inframalleolar, retromalleolar, and supramalleolar), and
the average area was used to calculate tendon stress. The total length of the PTT was measured at the conclusion of the
experiment.
Frame-to-frame displacements were calculated during the
loading portion of each cycle. A 2-D phase sensitive cross correlation algorithm, described previously for other biomedical

applications [23], [24], [34], [41], produced a displacement
map along both directions at each pixel location in the ultrasound image, along with the correlation map (“trashogram”) for
estimating tracking confidence. Strain was calculated from the
displacement along the tendon axis (longitudinal, or x direction): For each pixel, the longitudinal stain Sxx was calculated

1181

from Sxx = (d2 − d1 )/L, where d1 and d2 are the displacements at each end of the window of length L. This was repeated
across the entire image, yielding longitudinal strain information
throughout the tendon and surrounding structures within the
B-mode image. Finally, the loading force (F) recorded by the
MTS was used to calculate stress σ from σ = F/A. Young’s
modulus Exx was then computed by dividing the estimated
stress by the measured strain (Exx = σ/Sxx ).
To isolate the tendon from background structures, and automatically choose a region of interest (ROI), principle component analysis (PCA) was performed on the lateral displacement
maps during the load cycle. Because the PTT has larger displacements and velocities compared to the surrounding tissue,
the peak of the first principal component was always within
the PTT. The ROI was then chosen to be a rectangular region
(3.9 mm × 1.2 mm) centered at the weighted centroid of the
first principal component for each trial. The mean and standard
deviation (SD) of the displacement, strain, and Young’s modulus of the PTT were calculated over this ROI across multiple
trials.
For this cadaveric study, UEI measurements were compared
with the MTS as the gold standard for estimating Young’s modulus for the entire tendon. The stroke (displacement) recorded
by the MTS was expected to be larger than the displacement
from UEI, because the former represents the displacement of
the tendon at the free end and the latter the displacement at
a region near the fixed end. Nevertheless, the two should be
strongly correlated. Stroke was converted to strain for the MTS
using the total length of the PTT. For comparison and validation
of UEI with MTS, we expected the strain values to be similar for
the two techniques. Furthermore, the average Young’s modulus
determined by the MTS over the entire tendon was calculated
using the same equations described previously and compared
with that of UEI. The coefficient of determination (R2 ) between
UEI and MTS was also calculated across the specimens for
displacement, strain, and Young’s modulus.
Finally, to further verify the accuracy of UEI, we compared
video tracking of surface strain with ultrasound strain estimates
in one tendon. This validation was performed in the supramalleolar portion of the PTT, as it was not practical to perform video
tracking in the retromalleolar position where the tendon bends
around the malleolus. UEI was first performed with the skin
intact and the imaging location marked. The skin at the marked
location, subcutaneous tissue, and tendon sheath were then dissected to expose the surface of the PTT. Fiducial ink marks were
placed on the tendon surface. The same load–unload cycle was
performed, and the movement of the PTT was recorded using a
digital camera (Canon G12). Video strain was estimated using a
motion analysis software package (Tracker, Video Analysis, and
Modeling Tool [42]). The coefficient of determination (R2 ) and
mean difference were then calculated to compare UEI and video
tracking strain values.
III. RESULTS
UEI displacement and strain maps for a representative PTT
are displayed in Fig. 2. The primary motion and deformation
occurred along the longitudinal axis of the tendon.

The longitudinal displacement, strain, and Young’s modulus values were at near-maximal force (550 N). The donor ages for the five
specimens ranged from 68 to 92 years old. Specimen 3 and 5 were from male donors.

Fig. 3 presents a map of the 2-D speckle tracking correlation coefficient, longitudinal displacement, strain, and Young’s
modulus for one tendon at an applied load of 550 N. The displacement map [see Fig. 3(b)] clearly identifies the tendon
from surrounding tissue. The displacement within the tendon
(3.33 ± 0.23 mm) over the ROI displayed in Fig. 3(b), is much
higher than the displacement outside the tendon (0.87 ± 0.04
and 0.09 ± 0.08 mm in the malleolus and the dermal layers,
respectively).
Table 1 lists the tendon CSA, total tendon length, longitudinal
displacement, strain, and Young’s modulus of each specimen.
Fig. 4 compares results for the MTS and UEI for measuring displacement (R2 = 0.95), strain (R2 = 0.88), and Young’s
modulus (R2 = 0.96). The average Young’s modulus for the five
tendons calculated from UEI was 0.45 ± 0.16 GPa, compared
with 0.52 ± 0.18 GPa for measurements from the MTS.
Fig. 5 directly compares strain measurements obtained using
UEI with those using video tracking for one tendon. Video strain
at the surface of the tendon was similar to UEI measurements
within the tendon (R2 = 0.80). The mean difference between
the two strain curves was 0.11 ± 0.03%.
Fig. 6 describes the relationship between the applied load
and inversion force recorded by the load cell. The slope and R2
values were 0.12 ± 0.01 and 0.999, respectively, indicating that
the inversion force is approximately one eighth of the applied
load. The relationship between the inversion force, a measurable
quantity in vivo, and the force on the tendon is an important
parameter for potential clinical applications of UEI in PTTD
patients.
IV. DISCUSSION
The primary goal of this study was to develop and validate the
technique of UEI of the PTT. Our results indicate that UEI is capable of accurately measuring the mechanical properties of the
human PTT in a cadaveric model. UEI estimates of displacement, strain, and Young’s modulus were all highly correlated
with those obtained from the stroke of the MTS crosshead (see
Fig. 4). There was a close agreement between Young’s modulus for UEI (0.45 ± 0.16 GPa) and MTS (0.52 ± 0.18 GPa).
Differences could be explained by regional variations in the
measurements. Whereas UEI measured the mechanical properties over a small, high-stress region above the malleolus, the

Young’s modulus (Bottom) using MTS (gray, entire tendon) and UEI (black,
localized region). All values were calculated at 550 N. The red error bar denotes
standard deviation (SD), which was calculated for each specimen over three
trials. The displacement for the MTS was much larger than UEI because the
MTS measurement occurred across the entire tendon rather than just the local
region above the malleolus. Nevertheless, there was a high correlation between
UEI and MTS for displacement (R 2 = 0.95), strain (R 2 = 0.88), and Young’s
modulus (R 2 = 0.96) for the five specimens.

This plot includes results for three trials for each of the samples. The average
slope is 0.12 ± 0.01 with R 2 = 0.999.

MTS recorded an average value across the entire length of the
tendon. The tendon might also be more compliant in the imaged retromalleolar region. Moreover, dynamic video tracking
of surface strain was highly consistent with ultrasound strain
estimates (see Fig. 5).
Two previous studies measured Young’s modulus of the dissected PTT (0.81 ± 0.14 GPa and 0.91 ± 0.23 GPa) [43],
[44]. However, these values were at a much higher tendon load
(2500 and 3600 N) than our study (588 N). Based on the
load–displacement curve provided in one of these studies,
Young’s modulus was approximately 0.45 GPa at 600 N [44],
which is similar to our result.
One potential limitation with this project relates to the use of
thawed cadaveric specimens. There is evidence that freezing followed by thawing alters the structure and mechanical properties
of the tendon [43]. That study found that frozen specimens of
the human posterior tibial tendon, compared to fresh specimens,
exhibited 30% lower stress and strain than fresh specimens primarily due to a decrease in collagen fibril density. However,
Young’s modulus was not significantly different between the

1183

two groups, implying that Young’s modulus for thawed PTTs is
likely similar to fresh PTTs.
Another potential limitation of the study relates to speckle
tracking noise and out-of-plane motion of the tendon. For optimal imaging, it is important that the sonographer maintain the
probe parallel to the long axis of the PTT during the loading
phase. The speckle tracking coefficient and B-mode movie provide feedback for the quality of the images. Fig. 3(c) provides
evidence of out-of-plane motion of a portion of the tendon as
it turned around the malleolus bone. This led to a nonuniform
strain pattern. In addition, because the primary motion of the
tendon was along its axis, transverse displacements and strain
were much smaller compared to longitudinal displacements. The
transverse displacement and strain would likely be more sensitive to deformation at the tissue interfaces and pressure applied
by the ultrasound probe, while less sensitive to the transverse
deformation of the PTT. Nonetheless, the transverse displacements were not used for calculating the mechanical properties
of the tendon.
UEI is a potentially powerful, noninvasive in vivo technique
to objectively quantify the mechanical proprieties of the PTT
and other tendons. This would require estimating tensile load (or
stress) noninvasively, which is a challenge in vivo. In this study,
the load applied to the PTT and the resulting inversion force at
the forefoot were simultaneously measured. Their relationship
was linear with a slope between the inversion force and tendon
load of 0.12 ± 0.01. This value could be used to estimate tensile
load from the measured inversion force obtained in vivo. A similar approach was successfully implemented in a study of the
human Achilles tendon [45]. For in vivo human testing, it would
be necessary to fix the ankle in maximal plantar flexion so that
other tendons would not be able to contribute to inversion of the
foot. It would also be necessary to brace the lateral malleolus
to prevent lateral translation of the ankle. The development of
techniques for precise and accurate measurement of the inversion force would be an important step in the development of
UEI as a clinical tool for guiding treatment of tendinopathies.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ultrasound elastography reliably quantifies the mechanical properties of the
PTT in a human cadaveric model. This is an important first
step in the development of UEI as a clinical tool for objectively quantifying tendon mechanical properties in patients with
tendinopathies. Such a clinical tool could aid in the prognosis,
guide treatment decision making, and monitor response to treatment for a number of degenerative tendon disorders, including
PTTD.
