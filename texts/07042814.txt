Abstract—Objective: This paper presents the results of a new
approach for selection of RF time series features based on joint
independent component analysis for in vivo characterization of
prostate cancer. Methods: We project three sets of RF time series
features extracted from the spectrum, fractal dimension, and the
wavelet transform of the ultrasound RF data on a space spanned by
five joint independent components. Then, we demonstrate that the
obtained mixing coefficients from a group of patients can be used
to train a classifier, which can be applied to characterize cancerous
regions of a test patient. Results: In a leave-one-patient-out cross
validation, an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of
0.93 and classification accuracy of 84% are achieved. Conclusion:
Ultrasound RF time series can be used to accurately characterize
prostate cancer, in vivo without the need for exhaustive search in the
feature space. Significance: We use joint independent component
analysis for systematic fusion of multiple sets of RF time series
features, within a machine learning framework, to characterize
PCa in an in vivo study.
Index Terms—Joint independent component analysis (jICA),

I. INTRODUCTION
ROSTATE cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed
malignancy among men in North America. According to
the American and Canadian cancer societies, about 262 000
new cases are diagnosed, and 33 600 die of PCa annually in
North America.1 Early diagnosis and accurate staging of PCa

facilitates appropriate treatment options including surgery, ablation, and radiation therapy [1]–[3]. Currently, the definitive
diagnosis of PCa is core needle biopsy under transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance. The biopsy procedure involves taking
tissue samples from predefined anatomical regions of prostate.
This procedure is performed in a blind manner, since conventional ultrasound B-mode imaging is not capable of differentiating between cancerous and normal tissue regions, with high
sensitivity and specificity [4]–[6]. Studies have shown that the
Gleason scores (GS) determined using biopsy samples have the
underestimation of 19–57%, and overestimation of 5–50% in
comparison to the GS obtained by the radical prostatectomy
[7]–[12].
Ultrasound-based tissue typing approaches have been used
to increase the detection rate of cancer. Major ultrasound-based
tissue typing approaches for characterization of PCa include
texture-based spectral analysis of ultrasound data in a single
RF frame, elastography, Doppler, and RF time series. Texturebased methods analyze the first- and second-order statistics of
gray levels of B-mode images [13], and probability distribution
models fitted to the estimated histogram of B-scan intensities
[14]. However, such methods have several shortcomings including high dependence to imaging settings of the ultrasound scanner, signal attenuation, signal dropout, and shadowing [15]. Raw
RF data are the beam-formed ultrasound signal before applying
the postprocessing required to form B-mode images. Spectral
features extracted from the calibrated power spectrum of ultrasound data in a single RF frame have been used to improve
cancer yield [16], [17]. These features are mostly related to the
scatterer size and concentration, and acoustic impedance of the
tissue. The primary shortcoming of this approach is the need
for meticulous calibration based on imaging parameters. Recently, histoscanning, a commercial system that uses features
of a single RF frame, has been applied to characterize PCa.
Studies have reported an average sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 66% for 146 patients using histoscanning [18]. In the
past two decades, many research groups have used elastography for detecting PCa. In this method, viscoelastic properties
of tissue are estimated through an excitation procedure. Such
procedure involves tissue compression using high acoustic radiation forces or an external mechanical stimulus [19], [20]. The
results of a study among 311 patients have shown the diagnostic
sensitivities of 73% for elastography, 59% for TRUS, and 90%
for combination of elastography, and TRUS [21]. Although ultrasound elatography has been used vastly in the literature for
tissue typing approaches, its clinical application is limited due

to the required modification of the software or hardware of the
ultrasound scanner to generate relatively strong acoustic radiation forces or external excitation of the tissue, respectively.
Recent improvement in quantitative elastography, in particular,
shear wave imaging (SWI), is aimed to provide real-time local
tissue elasticity information. SWI has been primarily applied for
breast imaging with promising results [22]. In this approach, an
ultrafast imaging system is used to differentiate wave propagation speed. Ahmad et al. have demonstrated a sensitivity of 90%
and a specificity of 88% using SWI for PCa detection among 50
patients [23].
Cancer detection approaches using Doppler ultrasound
especially when the tissue response is enhanced with contrast
agents (microbubbles) have the potential to help detect neovascularization in carcinogenesis, although they are not accurate for delineating tumor boundaries [24]. Conflicting results
have been reported in the literature with respect to the performance of Doppler ultrasound [25]–[29]; a large-scale study
(> 3000) in four European centers showed that the sensitivity
and specificity of PCa detection using this method were below
65% [30]. This performance is not sufficient to augment systematic random biopsies. The use of contrast agents requires
intravenous injection and changes the established clinical workflow.
Recently, our group has proposed a tissue typing approach
using a sequence of ultrasound RF data (hereafter, referred to
as RF time series) obtained from a stationary tissue location.
This method has been successfully used in an ex vivo study to
identify PCa in 35 patients [31]. The results show that RF time
series features are significantly more sensitive and accurate compared to the best texture-based and spectral features of a single
RF frame for detecting cancerous tissue specimens. The area
under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve resulting
from tenfold cross validation for RF time series, texture-based,
and spectral features of a single RF frame are 0.87, 0.72, and
0.78, respectively. Two independent in vivo studies were also
conducted to characterize cancer using RF time series. In the
first study, average area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.76 was
achieved for six cases using spectral RF time series features
compared to an average AUC of 0.66 obtained using texturebased features [32]. In the second study, mean central frequency
(MCF) of RF time series spectrum and wavelet features were
used to achieve average AUC of 0.83 for seven cases [33]. Yet
selection of the best combination of RF time series features to
achieve high classification results have been challenging. Lack
of a systematic approach for selection of RF time series features
has led to the so-called “cherry picking” of the features. Such
issue could potentially cause the difficulty in generalizing the
tissue typing capabilities of RF time series approach for clinical
applications.
In this paper, we systematically combine multiple features
extracted from ultrasound RF time series in a machine learning
approach for characterizing PCa prior to prostatectomy in an
in vivo study. We use joint independent component analysis
(jICA) [34], [35] for fusion of spectral, fractal, and wavelet
features. JICA is an extension of ICA that uses extracted features
from the ultrasound RF data of each patient and maximizes the
independence among joint components. Here, we first identify

the modulation profile that reflects group differences by fusion
analysis of multiple features. The resulting profile is used within
a machine learning approach for characterization of cancerous
regions of 12 patients. Using the proposed approach, we extract
discriminative features without further computation for feature
selection, build a model from a group of patients and, then,
successfully extend it to a test patient. The significance of the in
vivo study presented in this paper is the employment of jICA for
systematic fusion of multiple sets of RF time series features, as
opposed to feature selection, in a machine learning framework
to characterize PCa.
II. MATERIAL AND METHODS
A. Data Acquisition and Gold Standard
Following institutional research ethics board approval, a cohort of 12 patients who selected prostatectomy as their choice
of treatment were recruited. Prior to prostatectomy, threedimensional (3-D) RF ultrasound data were collected using a
SonixTouch ultrasound scanner (Analogic Ultrasound, Richmond, Canada) and the linear side firing transducer of a 2-D
ultrasound probe (BPL9-5/55) mounted on a motorized cradle
held by a clinician. The patients were in a supine position,
while their knees were raised. We acquired a 120◦ fan of 2-D
parasaggital ultrasound B-mode images at intervals of 0.5◦ , and
reconstructed a B-mode volume with 0.12-mm isotropic voxels
for each patient. Then, RF time series data were taken with 2◦
rotational intervals, where each RF time series data comprises
128 frames taken at a frame rate of 77 frames/s with a 0.85 mm
lateral by 0.04 mm axial pixel size. RF time series at each imaging angle, with three dimensions in axial, lateral, and temporal
directions, was acquired in about 2 s and stored locally on the ultrasound scanner. Ultrasound data were acquired at a frequency
of 6.67 MHz and a depth of 5 cm, while time gain compensation was kept constant for all data acquisitions. After resection,
the prostate specimens were processed following a protocol to
facilitate 3-D reconstruction of whole-mount histology [36]. After fixation in 10% buffered formalin, we applied histology and
MR-visible strand-shaped fiducial markers to the specimens as
shown in Fig. 1. MR images were acquired on a Discovery
MR750 scanner (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, USA) at 3 T using
an endorectal coil (Prostate eCoil, Medrad, Warrendale, USA)
with a T1-weighted MR protocol yielding images with 0.3 mm
voxel spacing. Following MR imaging, the prostatic apex was
removed and the midgland was cut on a rotary slicer into three to

1798

five 4.4-mm-thick tissue slices for histological processing and
paraffin embedding. Cancerous regions with a Gleason grade
of 3 and higher, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), atrophy, and extraprostatic extension (EPE) were contoured on the digitized histology images
under the supervision of a genitourinary pathologist [37].
The gold standard for PCa evaluation is pathology. We register in vivo ultrasound to histology images in two steps: 1)
deformable registration of in vivo ultrasound to ex vivo MR, and
2) affine registration of ex vivo MR to histology images.
1) In Vivo Ultrasound to Ex Vivo MR Registration: A
fiducial-based algorithm was used to register histology to ex
vivo MR images [36]. Centre points on fiducial lines were identified on the histology images, while parametric curves corresponding to these lines were defined on the ex vivo MR images
using custom software. We minimized the fiducial registration
error between the fiducial points and the corresponding curves
by providing an optimum 2-D–3-D affine transformation from
each histology to its matching ex vivo MR images. Using this
approach, we achieved a target registration error of 0.7 mm [36].
2) Ex Vivo MR to In Vivo Ultrasound Registration: The
prostate boundaries were contoured manually on ex vivo MR
and in vivo ultrasound by two trained graduate students.
A clinician (urologist or radiologist) verified the prostate
boundaries. Prostate segmentation in MR images was performed automatically using an intensity-based segmentation approach (www.itksnap.org) followed by manual modification of
the boundaries (www.slicer.org). Then, the generated labeled
prostate boundaries were rigidly aligned using the orientation
of the prostate on the ex vivo MR (as shown in Fig. 1) and
in vivo ultrasound images. Subsequently, an intensity-based
affine registration using a multiresolution global optimization
(www.slicer.org) was applied to register the aligned segmented
binary images [33], [37].

B. Region of Interest (ROI) Selection and Feature Extraction
We extract RF time series features over 524 equally-sized
ROIs from eight patients (patients 1–8) with large cancerous
lesions. The ratio of the number of normal and cancerous ROIs
is 1:1. The average largest lesion size for patients 1–8 is 19
mm, while the maximum largest lesion size is 40 mm. The
GS for cancerous regions of patients 1–8 are 6–8. We also
extract RF time series features over 576 normal ROIs from
four patients (patients 9–12) with small cancerous lesions. The
average largest lesion size for patients 9–12 is 7 mm, while
the GS for their cancerous regions are 6–7. The size of each
ROI is 1.7 mm × 1.7 mm. The ultrasound RF time series for
each ROI contains 44 × 2 × 128 pixels in axial, lateral, and
temporal directions. In other words, each ROI contains 88 RF
time series of 128 samples length. We select cancerous ROIs
from the dominant lesions with GS ≥ 6, where cancer appears
in consecutive slices. We also leave a 5 mm safe margin from the
normal ROIs to cancerous, BPH, PIN, EPE, and atrophy regions
[37]. Three sets of RF time series features including spectral,
fractal, and wavelet features are extracted from the ultrasound
data of cancerous and normal ROIs.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 7, JULY 2015

Spectral features: Ultrasound RF time series is generated
from 128 consecutive acquired frames of each RF sample of
the imaging plane. Sixty-four spectral features (features 1–64)
are computed by averaging the absolute values of the discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) of the zero-mean RF time series for 64
positive frequency components of each ROI. Due to symmetry,
only the positive frequency components of the spectrum are
used, which correspond to the frequency range of 0 to 38.5 Hz.
Fractal dimension features: Fractal dimensions of each ROI
is computed using Higuchi’s method by averaging the fractal
dimensions of 88 time series of the RF samples of each ROI.
In this method, mean length of the signal is computed at different scales. The slope of the fitted line to the length versus
scale is measured as fractal dimension [38]. Twenty-five fractal
dimension features are generated for maximum scales of 2–26
(features 65–89).
Wavelet features: A discrete wavelet transform is applied
to the ultrasound RF time series of each RF sample using
Daubechies 4 filter bank. The signal is decomposed to approximation and detail coefficients [37], [39]. Approximation
coefficients at four levels of decomposition are computed, and
averaged over each ROI. The wavelet features constitute features
90–125.
C. Joint Independent Component Analysis
The goal of jICA is to represent combined features as a set of
independent and linearly mixed components. Joint ICA assumes
a noise-free generative model X = AS. In this model, X =
[x1 , x2 , . . . , xN ]T is the matrix of features, where xi is a vector
formed by concatenating the three sets of features as

function is used to map the data to a space with higher dimension, where a hyperplane is optimized to separate two classes
with maximum margin [33]. The SVM soft margin coefficient
and the initialization parameter for RBF kernel function are selected in a similar manner to that presented in [33]. In addition
to the binary class labels, we generate ROC curves and cancer
likelihood maps using the class posterior probability estimates
(see [41] for details of this implementation).
E. Effect of ROI Size
We analyze the effect of choosing various ROI sizes to characterize cancerous tissue using jICA method. We choose three
different ROI sizes: 22 × 1, 44 × 2, and 66 × 3 pixels, which
correspond to physical dimensions of 0.85 × 0.85, 1.7 × 1.7,
and 2.6 × 2.6 mm2 . The original ROI size used in the analysis
presented in this study (1.7 × 1.7 mm2 ) is divided into four
smaller ROIs (0.85 × 0.85 mm2 ). The larger ROI size (2.6 ×
2.6 mm2 ) is 50% larger than the original size in axial and lateral
directions.
Fig. 2. Classification framework: RF time series features of cancerous and
normal ROIs from 11 patients are decomposed to jICs and coefficients using a
jICA method. The coefficients are used for training an SVM classifier. Using the
generated jICs, testing data are decomposed from the RF time series features of
a test patient.

Sk ,l is the kth independent component for the lth RF time series feature. The jICA method, shown schematically in Fig. 2,
involves finding Atest = Xtest W , where Xtest is the matrix of
features for the ROIs of a test patient W = S −1 , and Atest is
mixing coefficients matrix for a test patient.
To perform jICA, we assume that the same mixing coefficient matrix is generated by decomposition of different sets of
RF time series features. Such decomposition enables us to examine the common connection between RF time series features
by performing ICA on the concatenated features. Here, joint
independent components (jICs) are found using the Infomax
algorithm [40], which is based on minimization of mutual information of components. In this algorithm, to maximize the
mutual information between the input X and the output S of
a neural network, output entropy is maximized adaptively. The
neural network outputs are the jICs. In this study, we have
repeated the analysis for number of components between 1
and 30.
D. Classification
We use a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to differentiate between cancerous and normal ROIs.2 Here, an RBF kernel

III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
We follow a leave-one-patient-out cross-validation strategy
by performing 12 leave-one-patient-out evaluations for 12 patients. For each evaluation, we decompose the extracted RF
time series features of the ROIs from 11 patients into jICs and
their corresponding coefficients as shown in Fig. 2. Such joint
information exists between various RF time series features of
each ROI. A classifier is then trained using the corresponding
coefficients of the decomposition with known labels. The RF
time series features of the ROIs of a test patient is projected on
the space spanned by the jICs generated from 11 patients. The
corresponding coefficients of the decomposition are used as the
testing data in the classification framework. Since normal mixing coefficients outnumber cancerous mixing coefficients, we
randomly select normal mixing coefficients equal to the number of cancerous mixing coefficients. We repeat this procedure
for 200 times and average the classification results for each
leave-one-patient-out evaluation.
We generate the average classification results for 12 leaveone-patient-out evaluations as a function of number of jICs. As
shown in Fig. 3, by increasing the number of jICs to 5, the highest average classification accuracy of 84% and AUC of 0.93 are
achieved. The classification accuracy and AUC drop to 72% and
0.84 by increasing the number of jICs to 18 and do not change
significantly after that. In this study, we have used five jICs
(jIC1 –jIC5 ) to generate the classification results. Fig. 4 shows
the histograms of five sets of coefficients generated for classification between cancerous and normal ROIs of 12 patients.
The results of two-tailed t-test between each set of cancerous
and normal coefficients show that cancerous and normal coefficients of jIC1 , jIC2 , jIC4 , and jIC5 are statistically different
at a significance level of 5% (p-value ≤ 10−18 ), while based
on the results of the same statistical test, the cancerous and
normal coefficients of the jIC3 are not statistically different (pvalue = 0.9). 95% confidence intervals of normalized cancerous
coefficients for jIC1 − jIC5 are (0.58,0.61), (0.39,0.40), (0.74,

presents the mean of classification accuracies, 95% confidence

jICs vary between 59–77%, 0.65–0.92, 55–83% and 55–82%,
respectively. Using the combination of jIC1 –jIC5 , the mean
of classification accuracies, AUCs, sensitivities, and specificities for 12 leave-one-patient-out evaluations are 84%, 0.93,
82%, and 89%, respectively. The results of the Mann–Whitney–
Wilcoxon (MWW) test indicate that the classification accuracies
achieved using the combination of jIC1 –jIC5 improve statistically significantly compared to those obtained using individual jICs at a significance level of 5%. p-values generated from
MWW tests between the classification results using combination of jIC1 –jIC5 versus individual jIC1 –jIC5 are 49 × 10−3 ,
7 × 10−4 , 5 × 10−5 , 10−4 , and 7 × 10−3 , respectively. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 5, the classification accuracies, AUCs,
sensitivities and specificities using the combination of jIC1 –jIC5
vary between 64–100%, 0.74–1%, 55-100% and 72–100%,

respectively. Fig. 6 shows ROC curves for patients 1–8 using the
combinations of jIC1 –jIC5 through leave-one-patient-out evaluations. Note that ROC curves are only generated for patients
1–8, since cancerous ROIs are not chosen from patients 9 to 12.
A. Cancer Likelihood Colormaps
We generate cancer likelihood colormaps in the entire imaging planes of test patients through leave-one-patient-out evaluations. Here, a classifier is trained for each evaluation using the
extracted RF time series features of 11 patients and tested on the
features extracted from a test patient. Fig. 7(a) shows the in vivo
ultrasound B-mode images for eight examples of patients 1–8.
In Fig. 7(b), the cross sections of histology cuts on in vivo ultrasound images are depicted, while the cancerous regions with GS
≥ 6 are shown as white regions on the cross sections. Cancer
likelihood colormaps generated using a jICA method are overlaid on in vivo ultrasound images in Fig. 7(c). We have depicted
the colormaps for the regions that the estimated likelihood is
greater than 0.5.
B. Effect of ROI Size
We calculate the classification results using RF time series
features extracted from three different ROI sizes. As shown in
Table II, the highest classification results are achieved for the
largest ROI size (2.6 × 2.6 mm2 ). The average classification
accuracies using small (0.85×0.85 mm2 ), original (1.7×1.7
mm2 ), and large (2.6 × 2.6 mm2 ) ROI sizes are 78%, 84%,
and 86%, respectively. Multivariate analysis of variance of classification accuracies obtained using different ROI sizes, shows
no significant differences (p-value = 0.09). Moreover, choosing
original ROI size substantially improves AUC, sensitivity, and
specificity, compared to small ROI size.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this paper, five jICs generated from RF time series features are used to characterize PCa for 12 leave-one-patient-out

evaluations. Increasing the number of jICs results in slight
changes in the classification results, i.e., classification accuracy
and AUC decrease monotonically to 72% and 0.84, respectively,
and remain approximately constant as the number of jICs are increased to 30. The possible reasons for decrease of classification
results by incorporating more than five jICs are the addition of
noise in the new jICs and splitting the previously selected jICs
into new jICs. Using the mixing coefficients of the jICs 2–4
individually causes lower classification accuracies as presented
in Table I. The cancerous and normal coefficients of the third
jIC fail to show statistically significant difference. However,
the combination of all of these five mixing coefficients leads
to promising classification results. Features with higher values in each joint map have higher impact on characterization
of cancerous regions. Five jIC maps for spectral, fractal, and
wavelet features are shown in Fig. 8. Here, we investigate the
first two important jICs. In the first jIC, the second spectral feature (feature 2), all fractal dimension, and wavelet features have
higher discriminative impacts. However, fractal dimension features with lower maximum scale have higher impact in the first
jIC. The discriminative features for the second jICs are fractal
dimension features with higher maximum scale and the spectral
features excluding the lower frequency components. The corresponding coefficients of the cancerous and normal ROIs of the
patients are generated using the jICs. The coefficient histograms
in Fig. 4 clearly demonstrate that there is a major difference in
the distributions of cancerous and normal ROIs in particular for
the first and fifth jICs as presented in Table I.
To ensure our classification is not biased toward tissue information from specific zones of the prostate, we have incorporated
normal ROIs from all prostate zones and various depths in our
analysis. For patients 1–8, cancerous ROIs were mostly selected
from the peripheral zone, and the normal ROIs were chosen from
the central and transition zones. However, for patients 9–12, we
were able to select normal ROIs from all prostate zones. The
proposed approach presented in this paper performed well to
characterize PCa for most of the cases. However, the classification results for patient 4 are relatively low compared to other
patients. The possible reason is the low quality of ultrasound
B-mode images for this case which may cause error in segmenting the boundary of the prostate in ultrasound and registering
ultrasound and histology images.
Previously, we selected two RF time series features of MCF
and wavelet to characterize PCa [33]. MCF feature is extracted

features, respectively.

as the mean of the bandwidth of absolute values of DFT RF
time series. Wavelet feature is the first approximation coefficient at the maximum level of decomposition (n = 4). We use
these two features to perform 12 leave-one-patient-out evaluations to characterize PCa. An average classification accuracy
of 80% and an AUC of 0.93 are obtained for 12 leave-onepatient-out evaluations. The classification accuracies achieved
using the MCF and wavelet features are not statistically significantly different from those obtained using five jICs in this paper
(p-value = 0.07, MWW test). In this paper, comparable results
are achieved using jICs or MCF and wavelet features. In the
previous study, we have shown, through an exhaustive search,
that MCF and wavelet features achieve the highest classification
results to separate cancer and normal tissue. Such feature selection approach is very challenging especially when the number
of features increases significantly. Heuristic search approaches

IMANI et al.: ULTRASOUND-BASED CHARACTERIZATION OF PROSTATE CANCER USING JOINT INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS

can be used as well. However, there may be more than one “best
feature set”. As a result, small changes in the data can result
in various outcomes by selecting different locally optimum feature sets. The proposed jICA approach in this paper effectively
determines the best sources, derived from features, to differentiate between cancerous and normal regions of prostate without
exhaustive or heuristic search.
V. CONCLUSION
Ultrasound RF time series data have been used effectively
to characterize cancer for ex vivo and in vivo studies of human prostate. In this paper, jICs of three sets of RF time series
features are used in a machine learning approach for in vivo
characterization of PCa in a leave-one-patient-out cross validation for 12 patients. The average SVM classification accuracy of
84% and AUC of 0.93 are achieved using five jICs. The classification results achieved using the proposed approach without the
need for exhaustive search in the feature space are comparable
to those obtained using the heuristic search.
The jICs histograms and classification results generated by
using combination of spectral, fractal, and wavelet features
demonstrates tissue characterization capability of the RF time
series in frequency, time, and combined domains. Recently, we
have shown that the variation in speed of sound due to temperature increase while acquiring RF time series is an important
contributor associated with RF time series tissue specific information [38], [42]. In the study presented in this paper, in
addition to the RF time series features extracted from the spectrum and fractal dimension in time and frequency domains, we
have applied the wavelet features from the combined domains.
In this study, we classified the prostate tissue regions into
two classes of normal and cancer. Knowledge of the grade and
stage of each lesion not only facilitates appropriate treatment but
also reduces overdiagnosis. Future work will focus on including
more classes from various grades of cancer and PIN.
