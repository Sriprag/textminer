Abstract—Recent advances in high-density surface electromyogram (EMG) decomposition have made it a feasible task to
discriminate single motor unit activity from surface EMG interference patterns, thus providing a noninvasive approach for examination of motor unit control properties. In the current study, we
applied high-density surface EMG recording and decomposition
techniques to assess motor unit firing behavior alterations poststroke. Surface EMG signals were collected using a 64-channel
2-D electrode array from the paretic and contralateral first dorsal
interosseous (FDI) muscles of nine hemiparetic stroke subjects at
different isometric discrete contraction levels between 2 to 10 N
with a 2 N increment step. Motor unit firing rates were extracted
through decomposition of the high-density surface EMG signals
and compared between paretic and contralateral muscles. Across
the nine tested subjects, paretic FDI muscles showed decreased
motor unit firing rates compared with contralateral muscles at
different contraction levels. Regression analysis indicated a linear
relation between the mean motor unit firing rate and the muscle
contraction level for both paretic and contralateral muscles (p <
0.001), with the former demonstrating a lower increment rate (0.32
pulses per second (pps)/N) compared with the latter (0.67 pps/N).

firing behavior alterations poststroke using surface EMG, which
can be an important factor contributing to hemiparetic muscle

I. INTRODUCTION
TROKE is the leading cause of adult disability and the
second leading cause of death worldwide [1]. According to
the World Health Organization, 15 million people suffer stroke
each year. Of these, five million die and another five million
are permanently disabled [2]. Studies have shown that stroke
has a detrimental effect on health-related quality of life [3].
Following a hemispheric stroke, many patients suffer a variety
of disabling physical symptoms on the contralesional side of
the body, such as spastic hypertonia, muscular weakness, and
impaired movement coordination [4].
Restoration of impaired function after stroke should focus
on treating each of the suffered symptoms with appropriate
strategies. Compared with considerable efforts that have been
developed in treating spasticity for stroke survivors [5], there
are relatively few effective treatments available for paresis or
muscle weakness [4]. This may be attributed to the fact that the
mechanisms of paresis in stroke are largely unclear and might
include muscle atrophy [6], [7], loss of motor units [8]–[12],
uncoordinated muscle activation [13], and impairment in motor
unit pool activation [4]. In the current study, we focus on the
last factor and investigate motor unit control property alterations
that may cause insufficient motor unit activation.
In normal muscles, an optimal combination of motor unit
recruitment and rate modulation produces a maximal level of
force [14]. There is cumulative evidence to suggest that disruption of the functional relation between motoneuron firing
and motor unit contractile property may contribute to muscular
weakness in stroke. The evidence is still incomplete and mainly
comes from the indirect or elusive measurement of global surface electromyogram (EMG) parameters [15]–[20], or from selective intramuscular EMG decomposition [4], [21]–[24]. For
example, to reach the same force, an increase in paretic muscle
surface EMG activity (as measured by EMG amplitude) with respect to the contralateral muscle was observed, suggesting that
motor unit activation patterns become disorganized with an abnormally low motor unit firing rate (which requires recruitment

of higher threshold motor units to reach the target force) [15],
[18], [20]. Reduced motor unit firing rates in paretic muscles of
stroke subjects were further confirmed by direct measurement of
single motor unit behavior through intramuscular EMG decomposition. Relying on fine wire EMG recording, Gemperline et al.
[4] reported that all the six tested stroke subjects showed a failure to increase the motor unit firing rate during voluntary force
increments in paretic (hypertonic) muscles, with compression of
the motoneuron recruitment range. In half of the subjects, there
were significant reductions in motor unit mean firing rate in the
paretic muscle (while the other half showed similar mean firing rates), when compared to the contralateral muscle. Reduced
motor unit firing rates are expected to contribute to weakness
by altering the normally precise match between motoneuron
property and the mechanical property of the innervated muscle
fibers, which will reduce the efficiency of muscle contraction,
and in turn lead to increased effort and more rapid fatigue.
So far, direct evidence of motor unit firing behavior disruption
from surface EMG is lacking due to great difficulties in extracting motor unit firing behavior from interference surface EMG
patterns. Furthermore, previous studies on motor unit firing rate
alteration in stroke were mainly performed in proximal muscles
[4], [22]. It is presently unknown whether or how the motor unit
firing behavior may be altered in distal muscles. In light of this,
the current study investigated the behavior of single motor units
of a hand muscle over an extended range of force to determine
directly the nature and extent of motor unit firing abnormalities
using the state-of-the-art high-density surface EMG techniques.
Understanding the single motor unit behavior in stroke survivors
will help to classify the complicated nature of the functional impairment, which is important for the development of possible
therapeutic interventions.
In this study, the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle was
examined. The rationale for this choice was that the FDI muscle is the only agonist of the thumb-index finger joint so that a
correlation between force and EMG feature is explicit. In contrast, for other joints, multiple muscles are activated to produce
flexion or extension, thus compromising the accurate relationship between force (generated by multiple muscles) and surface
EMG (generated mostly by one muscle). Part of the study was
presented in abstract form at the Annual Conference of Society
for Neuroscience in 2013 [25].

II. METHODS
A. Subjects
Nine subjects with chronic hemiparetic stroke (6 male, 3
female, 59 ± 12 years) were recruited using the Clinical Neuroscience Research Registry at the Rehabilitation Institute of
Chicago. The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Northwestern University (Chicago, USA). All subjects
gave their written consent before the experiment. A screening
examination and clinical assessment were performed by a physical therapist. All the subjects had first-time stroke. The duration
of their stroke condition was 5.4 ± 3.8 years. They had no history
of spinal cord injury or traumatic brain damage, serious medical
illness such as cardiovascular or pulmonary complications, or
severe motion sickness. The index finger function of the paretic
hand was examined, and subjects who were unable to perform
voluntary index finger abduction were excluded from the study.
Across all the subjects, the Fugl-Meyer scale [26] was 50/66 ±
15/66, and the Chedoke-McMaster assessment [27] was 5.3 ±
1.3. A summary of subject information and clinical assessment
is presented in Table I.
B. Experiments
The examination of the FDI muscle was performed bilaterally
for each stroke subject. FDI is a multifunctional muscle that
generates torque about the second metacarpophalangeal (MCP)
joint. FDI muscle activation was measured during the isometric
abduction of the index finger based on the fact that the abduction
force produced at the MCP joint is generated primarily by the
FDI muscle [28].
Subjects were seated upright in a height-adjustable Biodex
Chair and a standard six degree of freedom load cell (FT 3226,
ATI Inc, Apex, NC) setup was used to accurately record the isometric contraction force of the FDI muscle (see Fig. 1). The load
cell can measure up to 65 N in the x- or y-axis with a maximum
output of 10 V. To minimize spurious force contributions from
muscles other than FDI, the following procedures have been
adopted: 1) the shoulders and waist of the subject were tightly
strapped to the chair to limit trunk and shoulder movements; 2)
the forearm and wrist were immobilized on a plastic platform
inside a fiberglass cast; 3) a ring-mount interface was used to

1244

trajectory and maintain the force as stable as possible during the
10 s constant force stage. The protocol for each target force was
performed twice. The order of target forces was randomized for
each subject. A rest period of at least 2 min between trials was
provided to prevent potential mental and muscle fatigue during
the experiment.
C. Data Analysis

surface electrode array used in this study. The array has 64 recording electrodes

vertical directions.

strap the wrist in a partial pronation position; and 4) the proximal phalanx of the index finger was casted and fixed to a small
ring-mount interface attached to the load cell.
Surface EMG signals were recorded from the FDI muscle
using a flexible 2-D electrode array (TMS International BV,
The Netherlands) [see Fig. 1(b)]. The skin over the tested muscle
was first wiped with electrode preparation pads saturated with
70% v/v isopropyl alcohol and pumice. Then a small amount of
absorbable conductive cream was rubbed on the skin and then
removed with great care to avoid short-circuiting the electrodes.
A compatible double-sided adhesive sticker was used to attach
the flexible electrode array to the tested muscle, after each of
its cavities being filled with conductive paste. A stable skinelectrode contact was further secured with medical tapes. A Refa
amplifier (128 channel regular plus eight auxiliary channels,
TMS International BV, The Netherlands) was used to record
surface EMG and force signals. Both surface EMG and force
signals were sampled at 2 kHz per channel, with a bandpass
filter (bandwidth 10–500 Hz) for surface EMG and a low-pass
filter (cutoff frequency 100 Hz) for force measurement.
For each subject, the paretic and contralateral FDI muscles
were examined in two separate sessions on different days. At the
beginning of the experiment, the isometric maximum voluntary
contraction (MVC) of the FDI muscle for index finger abduction
was determined. Then, the subject was asked to abduct the index
finger and generate an isometric contraction force of the FDI
muscle to match the target force of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 N, in different trials. A computer monitor in front of the subject displayed
the target and exerted forces. The target force was displayed as
a constant red trapezoid trajectory (16 s in duration including
3 s for the rising stage, 10 s for the constant stage, and 3 s for
the falling stage), and the trace of the tested muscle’s voluntary
contraction force was updated in real time with a different color.
Overlapping of the voluntary trace and the target trajectory in
the visual display indicated a good match between the desired
and actual forces. Before data recording, practice was given to
help subject familiarize with the task and making appropriate
adjustments to match the target force (using force visual feedback). Then, the subject was instructed to match the target force

All the data processing was performed offline. Surface EMG
and force signals during the constant force period (for at least
6 s) were selected from visual examination of the force signals.
Force deviation from pure abduction, defined as the arctangent
of the ratio between flexion and abduction forces (Fy/Fx), was
examined for all the trials before processing. Only trials with
flexion deviation less than 18° were analyzed in this study. The
surface EMG signals recorded from the electrode array were
decomposed to obtain single motor unit contributions. The convolution kernel compensation (CKC) technique [29], [30] was
used for this purpose. This decomposition algorithm has been
validated extensively with both simulated and experimental approaches, and the procedures have been described in previous
studies [31], [32]. Single motor units with consistent firing patterns during the processed constant force period were selected
for further analysis. For each motor unit, instantaneous firing
rates were calculated as the inverse of the interdischarge intervals. During this calculation, we excluded abnormally short
(shorter than 33.3 ms) and long (larger than 250 ms) interspike
intervals. The mean firing rate for each motor unit was calculated as the average of the instantaneous firing rates during the
constant force period. The global (or average) mean firing rate
for each force level was obtained by averaging the mean firing
rates of all the individual motor units processed at this force
level. The coefficient of variation (CoV) of each motor unit’s
firing rate, defined as the ratio of its standard deviation to the
mean, was computed. The CoV of the abduction force for each
contraction was calculated to quantify force dispersion. For each
tested subject, the CoV of the motor unit firing rate was averaged
from all the available motor units. The CoV of the abduction
force was also averaged across different levels of contraction.
This was performed for the paretic and contralateral muscles,
respectively.
Regression analysis was performed to examine any linear relation between the global mean firing rate and contraction force
(varying from 2 to 10 N) for the paretic and contralateral FDI
muscles, respectively. Paired T test was applied to assess the
difference of slope coefficients (obtained from the linear regression), and CoV of motor unit firing rate or force between
the paretic and contralateral muscles. Correlation analysis was
also performed to examine the relation between subject characteristics and motor unit firing behavior parameters. Statistical
significance was determined as p < 0.05.
III. RESULTS
Across the tested subjects, the maximum strength of the FDI
muscle during isometric index finger abduction (mean ± standard deviation) was 20.8 ± 9.1 N (range: 6.2–34.6 N) for the

paretic side, and 39.3 ± 11.8 N (range: 18.4–54 N) for the
contralateral side. In this study, the maximum level of force examined for each muscle varied from 29% to 97% MVC with
a mean of 53% MVC for paretic muscles, and varied from
19% to 54% MVC with a mean of 28% MVC for contralateral
muscles. All subjects were able to complete the required trials
except Subjects 8 and 9 who were unable to maintain sustained
contractions at 8 or 10 N for 10 s using their paretic FDI muscles. Table II summarizes the number of motor units extracted
from surface EMG decomposition, the number of motor units
(with consistent firing) used for firing behavior analysis, and
the number of processed trials for each force level. On average,
after decomposition, 12.9 and 16.4 motor units per trial were
extracted from paretic and contralateral muscles, respectively.
With further assessment, on average, 7.1 and 10.7 motor units
(with consistent and stable firing patterns) per trial were used
for firing behavior analysis for paretic and contralateral muscles,
respectively.
Fig. 2 displays an example of a stroke subject’s motor unit
firing events, a representative channel of surface EMG, and
force signals in abduction and flexion, respectively. The highdensity surface EMG signals were recorded from the paretic or
contralateral FDI muscle when the subject maintained a force
level (abduction of the index finger) of approximately 6 N. The
mean firing rate of individual motor units and mean force in
abduction and flexion were calculated during a constant force
period delimited by the two dashed vertical lines. Force deviation from pure abduction was assessed for each trial. In
this example, the arctangent of the ratio between flexion and
abduction forces (Fy/Fx) was 0.5° for the paretic muscle and
5.1° for the contralateral muscle. Thirteen (out of 17 extracted)
motor units from the paretic muscle and 18 (out of 23 extracted)
motor units from the contralateral muscle were used for firing behavior analysis, respectively. A lower global (or average)
mean motor unit firing rate was observed in the paretic muscle
(mean ± standard error: 12.16 ± 0.42 pulses per second (pps))
compared with the contralateral muscle (13.74 ± 0.44 pps)
(p < 0.05).
In general, eight subjects showed decreased motor unit firing
rate in their paretic FDI muscles compared with the contralateral muscles across all force levels. One subject (Subject 3)
showed higher mean firing rate at forces from 2 to 6 N and
lower mean firing rate at 8 and 10 N in his paretic muscle. Pooling all nine stroke subjects’ data, we found that both paretic

1245

and contralateral muscles showed an increment of the mean
motor unit firing rate with increasing of contraction level. The
global (or average) mean motor unit firing rates (mean ± standard error) in the paretic muscle were 11.89 ± 0.48, 13.33
± 0.84, 13.43 ± 0.7, 14.1 ± 0.7, and 14.73 ± 1.08 pps as
force varied from 2 to 10 N at 2 N increment. Likewise, the
global mean firing rate in the contralateral muscle increased
from 13.47 ± 0.84 to 15.37 ± 0.56, 17.37 ± 0.7, 18.56 ± 1.3,
and 18.64 ± 0.66 pps as the force increased from 2 to 10 N at 2 N
increment.
Examination of the relation between global mean motor unit
firing rate and contraction force was performed in the paretic
and contralateral hands for all subjects. An example of one representative subject’s data (the same subject as shown in Fig. 2) is
presented in Fig. 3(a), which indicates a strong linear relation between the global mean motor unit firing rate and muscle contraction level. For this subject, the ranges of individual mean firing
rates in the paretic side were: from 6.93 to 19.73 pps at 2 N (mean
± standard error, 10.95 ± 0.68 pps), from 7.55 to 21.26 pps at
4 N (11.7 ± 0.37 pps), from 8.56 to 22.64 pps at 6 N (12.41 ±
0.34 pps), from 6.77 to 18.95 pps at 8 N (12.72 ± 0.54 pps), and
from 8.07 to 20.76 pps at 10 N (12.91 ± 0.43 pps). The ranges
of individual mean motor unit firing rates in the contralateral
muscle were: from 6.43 to 17.38 pps at 2 N (11.29 ± 0.78 pps),
from 7.56 to 18.15 pps at 4 N (12.74 ± 0.26 pps), from 9.55 to
18.88 pps at 6 N (14.93 ± 0.28 pps), from 8.56 to 18.67 pps at
8 N (13.84 ± 0.42 pps), and from 11.15 to 20.19 pps at 10 N
(16.71 ± 0.41 pps). The global mean firing rate in the paretic
(pmfr) or contralateral (cmfr) muscles can be estimated from
the force (f) as: pmfr = 10.66 + 0.25 · f(r2 = 0.94, p < 0.01),
and cmfr = 10.32 + 0.6 · f(r2 = 0.83, p < 0.05), respectively.
The contralateral muscle showed a higher increment of firing
rate with increasing force (0.6 pps/N) compared with that (0.25
pps/N) of the paretic muscle. Similar findings were observed
in other five subjects showing a significant linear regression for
both paretic and contralateral muscles, with the latter showing
a higher slope coefficient compared with the former. Two of the
nine subjects demonstrated a significant linear regression in the
contralateral but not in the paretic muscles; note that regression
analysis was not applied in one subject’s (Subject 9) paretic
muscle due to lack of valid data at 8 and 10 N. Among the nine
subjects, only one demonstrated insignificant and similar slopes
for both paretic and contralateral muscles. Statistical analysis
based on eight subjects’ (excluding Subject 9) firing rate-force
slopes indicated a significant reduced slope coefficient in the
paretic FDI compared with the contralateral side (Fig. 3(b),
paretic: 0.32 ± 0.11; contralateral: 0.67 ± 0.11; p < 0.05).
Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the CoV of the motor unit firing
rates and the contraction forces for the paretic and contralateral muscles, respectively. The CoV (mean ± standard error) of
motor unit firing rates from the paretic muscle of all the tested
subjects was 0.21 ± 0.012, significantly higher than that (0.17
± 0.014) of the contralateral muscle (p < 0.05) [see Fig. 4(a)].
However, examination of the standard deviation of individual
motor unit firing rates did not reveal a significant difference between the paretic and contralateral muscles. The average standard deviation of motor unit firing rates was 2.78 ± 0.14 pps and

recordings is displayed. Both hands maintained a constant force of approximately 6 N in abduction. Note that abduction force was positive for paretic muscle and

2.83 ± 0.26 pps for the paretic and contralateral muscles, respectively (p > 0.05). Averaged from all the subjects, the CoV
of contraction force in abduction was 0.092 ± 0.008 for the
paretic muscle, significantly higher than that (0.055 ± 0.004) of
the contralateral muscle (p < 0.01) [see Fig. 4(b)]. No significant relation was found between subject assessment (weakness,
poststroke duration, Fugl-Meyer, and Chedoke scores) and motor unit firing parameters (motor unit firing rate, slope of motor
unit firing rate-force regression, and slope ratio between paretic
and contralateral muscles) (p > 0.1).

IV. DISCUSSION
A. Importance of Motor Unit Examination Poststroke
Following a stroke, paretic-spastic muscles often undergo
progressive changes in intrinsic mechanical properties, resulting in muscle contractures and alterations in muscle structure,
such as muscle fiber loss and connective tissue overgrowth.
These phenomena could be the result of one or more mechanisms, including disuse, autonomic vascular changes, pressure
neuropathy, a loss of central motoneuron trophic influences,

stimulation and other treatments may be necessary [34]. Related
to the focus of the current study, if research findings demonstrate
impairment in motor unit control properties, a different intervention strategy targeting motor unit activation capacity should
be used (see below).

and transsynaptic spinal motoneuron degeneration [8]. Regardless of the origins, it is very important to determine whether and
how stroke may adversely affect motor units’ survival or function. This information can guide the development of effective
treatments for weakness and other associated muscle property
changes in stroke. Knowledge derived from the analysis of different motor unit components will help to identify factors that
contribute to deterioration in muscle strength and ultimately inform intervention strategies that will allow stroke patients to
remediate and enhance the quality of life. For example, for a
specific stroke subject, if research findings indicate that muscle
fiber atrophy is the major factor contributing to muscle weakness and other pathological changes, active therapies or targeted
exercises are required to prevent further atrophy and regain muscle strength [33]. If research findings confirm motor unit loss
and associated muscle weakness poststroke, treatment strategies
can be directed to develop ways to prevent motor unit loss (e.g.,
growth factor interventions) during acute phase of the stroke [9].
However, given that some motor unit loss may be unavoidable,
enhancing the natural reinnervation process through electrical

Our findings in FDI are consistent to those from proximal
muscles [4]. There was a significant motor unit firing rate reduction in paretic FDI when compared with the contralateral
muscle. However, no significant correlation was found between
motor unit firing parameters and clinical assessment. This could
be due to several factors. For example, the Chedoke or FuglMeyer scores evaluate the general hand and upper limb functions, which may not be directly related to a single muscle.
Moreover, motor unit firing parameters were not calculated at
the muscle’s maximal strength. It should also be noted that in
addition to firing rate, complex changes in other motor unit properties poststroke might also influence clinical measurements.
As discussed in the previous studies [4], [24], different mechanisms may cause deficient motor unit rate coding in a paretic
muscle. The most common explanation is that the motor unit
firing rate reduction could be produced as a result of decreasing
descending excitation or synaptic input to the motoneuron pool,
due to upper motoneuron lesions or interruption of commands
from the affected hemisphere to motor units [35]–[37]. The motor unit firing rate reduction could also be produced as a result of
changes in intrinsic spinal motoneuron properties, which may
influence their sensitivity to neural activation of the muscle [38],
[39]. For example, it was demonstrated that the estimated time
course of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in motoneurons innervating paretic muscles of stroke subjects was significantly
longer than those innervating contralateral muscles. The motoneuron AHP time course changes poststroke may play a role
in the reduction of motor unit firing rates of paretic muscles
during voluntary contraction [40], [41].

For stroke patients with confirmed impairment in motor unit
control properties, the treatment may be oriented toward modifying regional synaptic input to motoneurons or changing their
chemical environment, which may help to recover motor unit
rate coding capacities. We also note that maximum motor unit
firing rates are reported to be adaptable to standard resistance
training practices [42]–[44]. It is presently unknown whether or
how such training may enhance motor unit pool activation in
stroke patients. This is a question worth further investigation.
C. Intramuscular EMG Versus Surface EMG Decomposition
One primary feature of this study was the application of the
state-of-the-art surface EMG decomposition techniques. Electrophysiological studies have played an important role in assessing poststroke changes in muscle and motor unit function.
Most of the methods involved invasive EMG recordings (e.g.,
single-fiber EMG, concentric needle EMG, and macro-EMG)
[45]–[52] or electrical stimulation (compound muscle action potential and motor unit number estimation) [8]–[12]. Traditionally, intramuscular EMG that relies on invasive needle or fine
wire electrodes has been used to obtain the physiological and diagnostic information about motor unit properties [53]–[55]. Surface EMG decomposition has been a research focus in the past
decade, and progress has been made in both surface EMG signal
acquisition and processing techniques [56]–[58]. For example,
high-density surface electrode arrays with tiny skin-electrode
contact area and small interelectrode distance provide spatial
information across a muscle, which increases motor unit discrimination capacity and makes extraction of single motor units
from surface EMG a feasible task with appropriate signal processing methods [29]–[32], [59]. Among the surface EMG decomposition studies, two recently reported developments, by
Holobar and colleagues using the CKC technique that relies on
high-density EMG recording [29], [30], and by De Luca and
colleagues using an enhanced artificial intelligence algorithm
with a small 5-pin sensor [60], [61], have attracted attention
(and triggered debates [62], [63]).
Based on high-density surface EMG recordings, the CKC
technique was applied in this study to extract single motor unit
activity. The technique has been demonstrated to cope successfully with the irregular motor unit firing patterns before, such
as in the case of pathological tremor [64]. In the current study,
it has been for the first time applied to poststroke patients, providing direct evidence of motor unit behavior alterations after
stroke using surface EMG, which supports and supplements the
previous findings obtained using intramuscular EMG or conventional single-channel interference surface EMG analysis [4],
[15]–[24].
The advantage of noninvasive surface EMG recording is obvious. It overcomes pain and other discomfort and inconvenience
associated with needle insertion. From our experience and other
reports [65], it is not uncommon that subjects may feel stress and
discomfort with needle insertion and may even withdraw from
the study. In contrast, all subjects finished the protocols in this
study. Compared with the needle or fine wire EMG (with quite
limited detection volume), high-density surface EMG recording

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 5, MAY 2015

and decomposition techniques can be used to extract the activity
of a relatively large number of motor units in a large portion of
a muscle, thus providing solid and comprehensive information
about single motor unit behavior after stroke.
D. Surface EMG Decomposition Versus Interference
Pattern Analysis
Measurement based on interference surface EMG analysis
has been used to examine neuromuscular changes after stroke.
For example, previous investigators reported that almost half of
their examined hemiparetic subjects showed substantially elevated EMG-amplitude versus force slopes (measured over the
biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscles) in paretic muscles
compared with contralateral muscles [4], [15]. In a recent study
of the FDI muscle [16], it was reported that there were diverse
changes in the slope of the EMG-force relations in paretic muscles compared with contralateral muscles (i.e., with significant
increases or decreases of the slopes being observed relative to
the contralateral side for different subjects). Similarly, when
examining the alterations in the amplitude distribution of the
FDI muscle surface EMG poststroke at matched force levels,
different patterns of the distribution (a shift toward both larger
and smaller peak amplitude values) were observed in the paretic
muscles compared with the contralateral muscles [17]. These
interference surface EMG findings, in combination with our
previous simulation studies [20], suggest that there appear to be
different types of processes (e.g., motor unit control property alteration, muscle fiber atrophy, spinal motoneuron degeneration,
muscle fiber denervation, reinnervation, etc., which can also be
examined by needle EMG) at work which may be present in
different degrees in a given stroke patient. Extraction and examination of motor unit firing behavior (such as performed in
the current study) and quantitative motor unit action potential
analysis [66] can further help to confirm or quantify the specific
mechanisms underlying the global interference surface EMG
changes poststroke.
E. Experimental Protocols, Technical Aspects, and
Study Limitations
We chose to compare motor unit firing rates of paretic muscles to contralateral muscles of the same stroke subjects, rather
than muscles from neurologically intact subjects. Considering
the similarities in muscle mechanical moment arms, muscle
strength, and skeletal dimensions between the two limbs of the
same subject, such a comparison may allow a more straightforward assessment of motor unit firing behavior than would be
possible between muscles drawn from different subjects (potentially having a larger difference than two muscles from the same
subject) [4]. In addition, due to the elusiveness in interpreting
the significance of the maximum force measurements in paretic
limb (which are limited by incapability of full voluntary motoneuron pool activation) [4], the comparison between paretic
and contralateral muscles was made at the same absolute force
levels (i.e., using a matched force protocol) rather than at the
same fractions of each muscle’s MVC force.

LI et al.: EXAMINATION OF POSTSTROKE ALTERATION IN MOTOR UNIT FIRING BEHAVIOR USING HIGH-DENSITY SURFACE EMG

It was observed that after decomposition, lower number of
motor units was extracted from paretic muscle than from contralateral muscle. The relatively low decomposition yield for
paretic muscles could be due to pathological changes after
stroke, which might influence the decomposition performance.
For example, paretic muscle atrophy may reduce the total number of valid EMG channels. Firing rate reduction and possible
loss of large motor units [51] in paretic muscles may increase
the extent of superposition of a large number of relatively small
motor units. These factors may influence the decomposition
performance.
Since not all the active motor units were able to be extracted
from the surface EMG, the number of extracted or analyzed
motor units did not necessarily represent motor unit recruitment
at a specific force level. It has been shown in various previous
studies [29], [31], [32], [64], [67] that the unidentified motor unit
action potential trains after the CKC decomposition come from
small and/or distant motor units, constituting the physiological
noise which is always present in surface EMG, regardless the
decomposition technique used. In fact, physiological noise is
also present in intramuscular EMG, but there it is suppressed by
high selectivity of the detection electrodes. This means that both
surface and intramuscular EMG decompositions are limited in
representativeness. However, while being an important issue
that is common to all the decomposition techniques (surface
or intramuscular), the representativeness of an identified motor
unit pool should not be mixed with the accuracy of CKC-based
EMG decomposition. The latter has been extensively verified
in previous studies [29], [31], [32]. Moreover, in [67], the automatic measure of CKC-based decomposition accuracy has been
analytically derived and experimentally validated. This measure
is fully automatic and can be applied to every identified motor
unit. It has been extensively used in our study in order to select
only highly accurately identified motor units. All the other motor units were discarded and were not considered in our analysis.
Therefore, we believe that the presented results are highly accurate. The issue of representativeness can not be fully addressed
in this study as it reaches beyond the current state-of-the-art
in the EMG decomposition and remains an important research
topic to be addressed in the future. However, relatively large
number of identified motor units with significant changes in the
firing patterns has been observed, demonstrating the changes in
a significant portion (at least) of the active motor unit pool.
This study focused on the motor unit firing rates during the
constant force levels, while alterations in motor unit recruitment
range were not examined. In addition, the mean firing rates of all
the detected motor units were calculated at each specific force
level, without tracking the same motor units across different
force levels, while the latter is more useful in examining motor
unit firing rate modulation. A different force protocol with step
contractions in a single trial (rather than separate trials as used
in the current study) might be more appropriate for same motor unit tracking across different muscle contraction levels. The
experimental protocol can be further improved by determining
target forces based on each subject’s paretic muscle MVC (e.g.,
10%, 20%, 30% . . . 80%, 90% MVC) and then presenting the
same absolute force target for the contralateral muscle. This

1249

way, the full range of the paretic MVC for each subject can
be examined, while in this study, the maximum target force of
10 N represented a nearly paretic muscle MVC for stroke subjects with severe weakness but only approximately 30% paretic
muscle MVC for stroke subjects with mild weakness.
Finally, it is acknowledged that factors other than motor unit
control disorganization can also be associated with the observed
motor unit firing rate changes. For example, selective loss of motor units after a stroke might alter motor unit types or specific
muscle fiber contraction dynamics—those are factors closely
related to motor unit firing rates. Therefore, a comprehensive
examination using a range of techniques (e.g., motor unit number estimation, quantitative motor unit action potential analysis,
motor unit twitch characterization, etc.) would be necessary to
more precisely quantify poststroke motor unit control property
changes.
V. CONCLUSION
High-density surface EMG techniques were used to examine
motor unit firing behaviors poststroke. The tested stroke subjects showed decreased motor unit firing rate in the paretic FDI
muscle compared with the contralateral FDI muscle across all
the examined force levels (from 2 to 10 N with a 2 N increment
step). A strong linear relation between the global mean motor
unit firing rate and muscle contraction level was observed for
both paretic and contralateral FDI muscles, whereas the former
demonstrated significantly reduced slope or increment rate of
motor unit discharge compared with the latter. The CoV of the
motor unit firing rates (averaged from all the motor units at
different force levels) for the paretic muscle was significantly
higher than for the contralateral muscle. In contrast to previous studies that relied on intramuscular EMG decomposition or
interference surface EMG analysis, this study provides direct
evidence of motor unit firing behavior alterations poststroke
from surface EMG.
