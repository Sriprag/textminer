Estimating Conditional Probabilities for the
Detection of Unfavorable Copy Number Alterations
in a Targeted Therapy
Fang-Han Hsu, Edward R. Dougherty, Fellow, IEEE, Yidong Chen, and Erchin Serpedin*, Fellow, IEEE

Abstract—Emerging targeted therapies have shown benefits
such as less toxicity and higher effectiveness in specific types of
cancer treatment; however, the accessibility of these advantages
may rely on correct identification of suitable patients, which remains highly immature. We assume that copy number profiles,
being accessible genomic data via microarray techniques, can provide useful information regarding drug response and shed light on
personalized therapy. Based on the mechanism of action (MOA)
of trastuzumab in the HER2 signaling pathway, a Bayesian network model in which copy number alterations (CNAs) serve as latent parents modifying signal transduction is applied. Two model
parameters M -score and R-value which stand for the qualitative and quantitative effects of CNAs on drug effectiveness and
are functions of conditional probabilities (CPs), are defined. An
expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm is developed for estimating CPs, M -scores, and R-values from continuous measures,
such as microarray data. We show through simulations that the
EM algorithm can outperform classical threshold-based methods
in the estimation of CPs and thereby provide improved performance for the detection of unfavorable CNAs. Several candidates
of unfavorable CNAs to the trastuzumab therapy in breast cancer
are provided in a real data example.

I. INTRODUCTION
ARGETED therapies, including small molecules and monoclonal antibody inhibitors, are emerging oncology drugs
for the treatment of cancer [1]. Different from chemotherapy,
which comprehensively attacks rapidly dividing cells, including tumors and normal apparatuses such as bone marrow and
hair follicles, targeted therapy directly affects dysregulated bi-

ological pathways to stop tumor growth, promotes therapeutic
effectiveness, and reduces toxicity [2]. To date, a number of
targeted drugs have been approved by the FDA. For instance,
bevacizumab, a humanized drug that acts by interfering with the
function of vascular endothelial growth factor and reducing the
formation of new blood vessels, has been shown to be clinically
effective and is currently applied in the treatment of metastatic
colorectal cancer [3].
Besides numerous benefits, targeted therapy also comes accompanied by a number of challenges and disadvantages. The
side effects, though less severe, remain hazardous and harmful [4]. Additionally, some patients may present primary resistance or modest response to therapeutic agents [5], which
may result from copy number alterations (CNAs) [6], pathway crosstalk [7], and other individual differences regarding
drug metabolism [8]. Owing to the toxic side effects and high
costs [9] of therapeutic agents, evaluating the value and effectiveness of targeted therapy and identifying suitable patients
are important tasks in prolonging the survival and achieving
personalized therapy.
Frequent concordance between CNAs and gene expression
dysregulation in tumor samples has revealed the capability of
CNAs to affect gene transcription quantitatively: copy number
gains and losses may contribute to overexpression (activation)
and down-regulation (inactivation), respectively [10], [11]. In
previous studies, we have further shown through probabilistic
models that the effect of CNAs on gene expression is generally
nonlinear, and the concordance relationship may not always
hold [12], [13]. The probabilistic models also suggest that a
CNA may modify the intensity and accuracy of a regulatory
signal transduction.
However, how the CNAs involved in a signal transduction
pathway may interfere with signal transduction and thereby affect therapeutic efficacy remains largely unclear. Do the CNAs
of downstream genes generally lead to larger signaling deviations than those of upstream genes? Another legitimate question
is whether the number of CNAs accumulated along a pathway
is linearly correlated with the deviation or not? Perhaps the
most important question is determining the CNAs leading to
the largest signaling deviations and most affecting the drug response. Since the effectiveness of a targeted therapy may highly
rely on proper signal transduction, a regulatory model incorporating signaling pathway information with CNAs may be helpful
for answering the aforementioned questions.
Herein, we apply Bayesian networks [14], which have been
used for the study of gene regulatory systems [15], [16] and

signaling pathways [17], [18]. Based on the targeted drug
trastuzumab and its mechanism of action (MOA) via the HER2
signaling pathway, a string-structured Bayesian network model
that considers the interference of signal transduction due to
CNAs is applied and two scoring functions, “M-score” and
“R-value,” on the conditional probabilities (CPs) are utilized in
the evaluation of CNA effects on drug utility. An expectation–
maximization (EM) algorithm is used to evaluate M -score and
R-value from continuous measures such as microarray data.
Rigorous simulations reveal that our EM algorithm is superior
over classical threshold-based protocols [16], [19], [20] in parameter estimation and the detection of unfavorable CNAs. In
sum, the proposed Bayesian network, M -score, and R-value
model the qualitative and quantitative effects of CNAs on the
targeted therapy, and the EM algorithm provides good CP estimates for the evaluation of M -scores and R-values.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II justifies the assumptions and rationale from which the M -score and R-value
are defined. Section III introduces the EM algorithm, the simulation models, and the process for real data analysis. Simulation
results and CNA candidates detected from the real data example are provided in Section IV. The paper concludes with a
discussion in Section V.

II. JUSTIFICATION
A. Trastuzumab and HER2 Signaling Pathway
Targeted therapy has been shown to be effective and less
toxic in the treatment of cancer. Through a series of molecular
activations (inactivations) and signal transductions, therapeutic small molecules and monoclonal antibodies may react with
specific cancer-related targets and halt tumor growth. As an example, consider trastuzumab, an FDA-approved targeted drug
that has been applied to patients with HER2 positive breast
cancer. It is a monoclonal antibody that may bind to the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptors ERBB2
(HER2) and as a result it prevents the intracellular tyrosine kinase from phosphorylation (activation). The activation status of
the intracellular tyrosine domain of HER2 is associated with
tumor survival. Fig. 1 illustrates the major participants and their
roles in the HER2 signal transduction (adapted from KEGG
PATHWAY Database [21], [22]). An activated HER2 may promote cellular proliferation through the RAS/MAPK signaling
pathway and inhibit cellular apoptosis through the PI3K/AKT
signaling pathway [23]. Inactivating HER2 and passing signals
without obstacles are thus key factors that keep trastuzumab
effective [24].
B. Bayesian Network Modeling
Based on the MOA that trastuzumab assumes in the HER2
signaling pathway, mathematical and graphical modeling are
applied to investigate how CNAs may affect drug effectiveness.
Consider a drug target X0 and a signal transduction pathway
with a total of n + 1 participants (proteins), X0 → X1 → · · · →
Xn , in which arrows exhibit the direction of signal passing and
each protein Xi corresponds to a specific gene Gi . Let Xi , i =

0, . . . , n, be binary variables denoting their activation statuses
(1: active; 0: inactive). As shown in Fig. 2, the signaling pathway
can be graphically represented by n + 1 nodes connected by n
directed edges. The root X0 reflects whether the drug target is
bound by the therapeutic agent or not (1: nonbound and remains
active; 0: bound and becomes inactive), and the leaf Xn indicates
the signal output. Similar to the path that HER2 signals pass
down to ELK through the RAS/MAPK pathway (if we omit
MYC at this moment), the signaling pathway is string structured,
and the output signal Xn is assumed to be proliferation related
and tends to be activated due to the stuck-at-1 fault [25] at
X0 in tumor cells. We assume that each intermediate node Xi ,
i = 1, . . . , n − 1, contains one parent node, Xi−1 , and one child
node, Xi+1 . In addition, each nonroot node Xi , i = 1, . . . , n,
presents an additional latent parent Yi affecting its activation,
where Yi refers to the CNA status of gene Gi . Since the effects
of these CNAs on signal passage may or may not be significant,
the corresponding relationships are represented by directed and
dashed edges.
The probabilistic character is a result of inevitably incomplete representation of biological pathways and is invoked in
the modeling task. In fact, due to the complex nature of biochemical reactions in the regulatory system, the nonroot nodes
Xi , i = 1, . . . , n, in the string-structured pathway may have numerous latent parents (other than Yi ) or external genes regulating their activation. These uncertain controlling factors are

outsourced from the model, termed “contextual effects,” and
make the activation relations among nodes in the model generally indeterminate [26]. As proposed by [18], the probabilistic
character can be modeled by a Bayesian network. Specifically,
let Xi,1 and Xi,0 denote the relation Xi = 1 (activated) and
Xi = 0 (inactivated), respectively, and let Yi,1 and Yi,0 denote
the case with a certain CNA and the case with a normal copy
number, respectively. In this setting, a series of CPs are applied
in order to make the Bayesian network complete. As shown in
Table I, when the copy number is normal, the CP ηi , termed the
crosstalk parameter, refers to the activation probability of Xi
when its parent Xi−1 is inactive. Also, the CP δi , termed the
conditioning parameter, indicates the inactivation probability
of Xi when its parent Xi−1 is active. Generally, smaller values
of ηi and δi imply stronger communication from node Xi−1 to
Xi . When a certain CNA occurs, it is assumed that the CNA
of gene Gi mediates the signal passage from node Xi−1 to Xi
by adding a bias Δi to the crosstalk parameter ηi and a bias Δi
to the conditioning parameter δi . The strength of signal passing
dampens when Δi > 0 and Δi > 0.
To quantify the targeted therapy response, a new variable,
drug effectiveness E0→n via pathway X0 to Xn , is defined
as the probability of Xn (the output) being inactivated after
treatment minus the probability of Xn being inactivated before
treatment

and Ii is an indicator function defined as 1 in the presence of the
specific CNA (Yi,1 ) and as 0 when there is no such CNA (Yi,0 )
with gene Gi . Interestingly, the absolute position of participants
in the pathway does not affect the value of E0→n , suggesting
equal weights on upstream and downstream CNAs regardless of
their order in signal transduction.
C. M-Score and R-Value
After factorizing the multivariable function E0→n as the product of several lower dimensional functions fi , it is clear from
(4) and (5) that a larger summation of Δi + Δi > 0 represents
a more significant interference, therapeutically unfavorable, by
CNA Yi with the effectiveness E0→n . Based on this, a scoring function representing the CNA interference effect, termed
M-score, is defined as
Mi ≡

Δi + Δi
.
2

(6)

M -score ranges from −1 to 1. A positive value corresponds to
an unfavorable influence on drug effectiveness, whereas a negative value corresponds to a favorable influence. Additionally,
R-value is defined by
Ri ≡

1 − ηi − δi − (Δi + Δi )
.
1 − ηi − δi

(7)

It indicates the residual drug effectiveness when the signal
passes through the node Xi and can be applied to quantitatively
evaluate the variance that a CNA Yi may contribute. M -score
and R-value provide qualitative and quantitative information
regarding the effects of CNAs on drug effectiveness and are accessible when the CPs of signal transduction (see Table I) can
be estimated from the data at hand. The relationship between
them is demonstrated in Fig. 3.

A. CP Estimation
Given the roles that M -score and R-value, functions of CP
parameters η, δ, Δ, and Δ , may play in analyzing drug effectiveness, estimating these CP parameters is an essential task
for finding unfavorable CNAs. Although the activation signal is
modeled and assumed to be discrete and binary, in fact, activation status is commonly accessed through gene expression values, which are continuous measures (if microarrays are applied)
and may require rigorous transformations or mathematical inferences to make legitimate estimations.
A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to model signals and noise involved in the microarray measurements. Let
Zi−1 and Zi denote the log2 expression ratios of a parent signal Xi−1 and a child signal Xi , respectively. Suppose that Yi
remains 0 and is temporarily ignored at this moment. Assume
Zi−1 follows a normal distribution with mean μi−1,0 if Xi−1,0 ,
2
for both
and with mean μi−1,1 if Xi−1,1 . The variance is σi−1
cases. For the means, μi−1,1 = μi−1,0 + s, where s indicates the
signal strength or expression fold change differentiating the activation and the inactivation statuses of gene Gi−1 . The variance
2
represents noise due to individual differences occurring
σi−1
during microarray experiments. Similarly, Zi follows a normal
distribution with mean μi,0 and variance σi2 , or with mean μi,1
and variance σi2 , depending on the received signal Xi . Again,
μi,1 = μi,0 + s and σi2 is the same for both Xi,0 and Xi,1 . Gene
expression ratios can now be viewed as samples collected from
a mixture of four Gaussian distributions in the Zi−1 −Zi plane,
which are given by

is proposed. Using this log-likelihood function, the EM algorithm begins with an initial guess θ(0) and initiates a series of
updating iterations including an expectation step (E-step) and a
maximization step (M-step) to approach an estimate θ̂ leading
to the local maximum. In the E-step, a membership probability,

is updated using the parameters initialized at the beginning, or
optimized in the previous M-step, where l > 0 and the superscript (l) denotes the parameters updated in the lth iteration.
In the M-step, parameters are optimized by locating the local
maximum of λ. Setting the derivatives of λ with respect to
pj,k , μi−1,0 , μi,0 , σi−1 , and σi , respectively, to zero, parameters
are updated as follows:

Since the sum
of the probabilities of all events in a sample space
must equal 1, j,k pj,k = 1. In addition, as assumed previously
in the GMM, the following conditions are enforced:
μi−1,1 = μi−1,0 + s

The updating iterations stop when the changes of λ are negligible
(< 0.001). Parameter s remains constant during the iterations
and is considered to be either 0.585 (1.5 fold change) or 1 (2
fold change), depending on which leads to the largest λ after
the iterations. After this process, the final estimate θ̂ is derived.
Justifications and more details regarding the EM algorithm can
be found in [27].
Using the estimates p̂j,k , the CP parameters η̂i and δ̂i , with
the assumption Yi,0 , can then be expressed as

μi,1 = μi,0 + s.
The model parameter θ includes pj,k , μi−1,0 , μi,0 , σi−1 , σi , and
a constant s. Variables μi−1,1 and μi,1 are omitted from model
parameters on account of the restrictions.

are simulated and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves are applied. Using the same model [see Fig. 4(a)] for
positive cases, CNAs are invoked with P (C = 1) = 0.2, and the
corresponding signaling biases Δ and Δ are both set to 0.2. In
the negative cases [see Fig. 4(b)], the element A still controls B,
but C becomes an independent random variable. For both cases,
ηb = δb = 0.1 and the marginal distribution P (A = 1) are chosen to be 0.5 or 0.7. Moreover, a total of 200 or 500 samples are
simulated for M -score estimation. When continuous measures
are considered, μa,0 = μb,0 = 0, s = 1, σa = σb = 0.6, and the
status of C is assumed to be known. The mutual information
(MI) between B and C is additionally tested for applicability to
this detection problem. Ideal discrete measures assuming that
both B and C are known are considered when MI is applied.

respectively.
Alternative methods include a threshold-based discretization [16], [19], [20] and an outcome-counting process for the
estimation of CP parameters. Two classical thresholds, namely,
mean and median [28], [29], were considered for performance
comparison; gene expression measures were discretized to 0
and 1 if the values are smaller and greater than the threshold,
respectively. CPs are simply the outcome frequency, and M scores and R-values are estimated similarly using (11) and (12).
The comparison of CP estimators was made based on the root
mean square (RMS) error.
B. Simulation
The first simulation aims to unravel the relationship
between

and the rethe total number of unfavorable CNAs (i.e., ni=1 Yi ) 

maining percentage of drug effectiveness E0→n (i.e., ni=1 Ri ).
The simulation parameters are set up as follows: ηi = δi = η =
δ = 0.05 or 0.1, i = 1, . . . , n, and Δi = Δi = Δ = Δ = 0.1
or 0.2, i = 1, . . . , n. In this simulation, n = 7.
The next simulation compares the performance of CP estimation when data are continuous measures. A simple simulation
model containing three elements, A, B, and C, is considered.
As shown in Fig. 4(a), A regulates B, and C represents the CNA
status affecting the regulatory signal passing from A to B. In a
second simulation, there is assumed to be no CNA and C is fixed
to be 0. We set P (A = 1) = 0.5, ηb = P (B = 1|A = 0) = 0.1,
and δb = P (B = 0|A = 1) = 0.1. Continuous measures are artificially generated using the GMM introduced in Section III-A.
Performance in estimating η̂b or δ̂b via the EM algorithm, discretization by means, and discretization by medians is compared
using the RMS error derived from 10 000 repetitions, each of
which leads to an estimate, with the sample size (i.e., number
of points) being a specific number chosen from 50 to 500. The
inactivation mean values μa,0 and μb,0 for the continuous measures of A and B are set to 0 and s = 1. The different numbers
of samples and different intensities of Gaussian noise σa for A
and σb for B are considered.
The third simulation compares the capabilities of the estimated M -scores in the detection of unfavorable CNAs. 10 000
positive (dependent) and 10 000 negative (independent) cases

C. Real Data Example
M -score and R-value have been applied to real data
for finding CNAs that might affect HER2 signaling and
thereby decrease trastuzumab effectiveness in breast carcinoma. Gene expression and copy number profiles of 519 breast
invasive carcinoma (BRCA) samples have been downloaded
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repository website
(http://cancergenome.nih.gov/). The platforms for the gene expression and copy number data are Agilent G4502A microarrays
and Affymetrix Genome Wide Human SNP Array 6.0, respectively. Level 3 measures, which have been processed, normalized, and segmented by TCGA are directly applied. The middle
transcription regions of genes (according to UCSC hg19) are
used for matching gene expression values with copy number
ratios.
Copy number ratios are categorized into three statuses: gain,
normal, and loss. Among 519 BRCA samples under consideration, the samples with copy number ratios larger than 0.3 are categorized as gains; the samples with copy number ratios smaller
than −0.4 are categorized as losses; the remaining ones are categorized as normal cases. These thresholds, two common cutoffs
defining CNAs [30]–[33], are set asymmetrically because one
copy number loss would theoretically cause a larger ratio change
from zero than one copy number gain [34]. Gain and loss are
considered separately as two different CNAs. Specifically, when
copy number gain is tested, for each gene Gi , i = 1, . . . , n, participating in the signaling pathway, the following definition for
Yi is applied

1, if zi > 0.3
Yi =
(13)
0, if − 0.4 ≤ zi ≤ 0.3
where zi refers to the copy number ratio of gene Gi , and samples
with Yi values unassigned (i.e., copy number losses) are omitted
for the derivation of M̂i and R̂i . Similarly, when copy number
loss is tested, we assume

1, if zi < −0.4
(14)
Yi =
0, if − 0.4 ≤ zi ≤ 0.3
and samples with Yi values unassigned (i.e., copy number gains)
are omitted for the derivation of M̂i and R̂i . A minimum of

30 samples in both Yi,0 and Yi,1 cases are required for valid

As being string structured is the basic assumption upon
which M -scores and R-values have been defined, only the
RAS/MAPK part of the HER2 signaling pathway (as shown
in Fig. 1), which contains simply one branch at ERK causing
two leaves MYC and ELK, is considered in the data analysis.
To fit perfectly with the assumption, the RAS/MAPK part is
legitimately split into two string-structured paths (Path 1 and
Path 2), as leaves MYC and ELK are independent of each other
when the root ERBB2 is given. Table II lists relevant elements
and genes that may participate in the signal transduction. All
combinations of Gi−1 and Gi , i = 1, . . . , 8, are considered for
M -score and R-value evaluation.
IV. RESULTS
The results of the first simulation, shown in Fig. 5, reveal how
CNAs with the ability of interfering with the signal transduction
may affect targeted therapeutic effectiveness. Generally,
the per

centage of remaining drug effectiveness (i.e., 7i Ri ) descends
when there are more unfavorable CNAs located along the signal transduction pathway. The descending curve is nonlinear:
it drops quickly at the beginning and becomes gradually less if

more CNAs are involved. As illustrated by the solid line, which
indicates the cases with M -scores = 0.1 and η = δ = 0.05,
the drug effectiveness can drop up to 50% when there are three
unfavorable CNAs in the signal transduction pathway. This nonlinear relationship becomes clearer when M -score is equal to
0.2 (the dotted line), with which merely two CNAs can force
the drug effectiveness down to about 30%. CP parameters η and
δ may also alter the way by which CNAs affect drug effectiveness. The dashed line and the dot-dashed line refer to the cases
with η = δ = 0.1, in which the curves drop slightly quicker than
those with η = δ = 0.05.
Estimating CPs η̂b and δ̂b in the second simulation model
[see Fig. 4(a)] is done using the EM algorithm, discretization
by means, and discretization by medians assuming data are
continuous measures. As illustrated in Fig. 6(a)–(d), the EM
algorithm (solid lines) presents smaller RMS error and outperforms the others in CP estimation. Moreover, the superiority
becomes more significant when more samples or larger intensities of Gaussian noise are included. The simulation results also
demonstrate that a larger number of samples, or smaller Gaussian noise intensities σa and σb embedded in the continuous
measures, could generally lead to better estimates of η̂b and δ̂b .
The performance of M -scores at the detection of unfavorable
CNAs, which are capable of interfering signal transduction and
as a result decreasing drug effectiveness, is illustrated by the
third simulation. In Fig. 7(a)–(d), M -scores estimated by the
EM algorithm (solid lines) show better ROC curves over those
derived using discretization by means (dashed lines) and discretization by medians (dotted lines), regardless of the number
of samples and the marginal distribution of A. The additional test
on MI with ideal discrete measures (dot-dashed lines) suggests

ineligibility of MI and emphasizes the superiority of M -scores
for this detection task.
Using TCGA BRCA data and a threshold M -score > 0.1,
several CNA candidates with sound CP parameters η̂i < 0.4
and δ̂i < 0.4 were detected and listed in Table III. These results suggest that copy number gains of NRAS, KRAS, and copy
number losses of SHC2, NRAS, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, MAPK1
are possible unfavorable factors contributing to the decrease of
trastuzumab effectiveness.
V. CONCLUSION
Based on the Bayesian network model, we have justified the
role and importance of M -scores and R-values in targeted therapeutic effectiveness. Since M -score and R-value are functions
of CP parameters η, δ, Δ, and Δ , estimating these parameters
from data is an essential step to detect and evaluate effects of
unfavorable CNAs. Assuming that continuous measures such
as microarray gene expression levels are composed of activa-

2939

tion/inactivation signals plus Gaussian noise, an EM algorithm
has been applied to estimate these CP parameters. Via simulations, we have found that the proposed EM algorithm can
outperform other threshold-based discretization methods in the
estimation of CP parameters. With these CP estimates by EM
algorithm, M -scores can be properly evaluated and applied to
detect unfavorable CNAs in a specific targeted therapy, and this
method is robust to nonnormality (detailed in Appendix B) in
microarray measurements.
The EM algorithm generally takes a longer time to get the
CP estimates. To make a simple comparison, we assume that
an upper bound k of the number of iterations is added to the
stopping criterion. Since the time complexity for each iteration
with N samples is O(N ), the time complexity for the algorithm would then be O(kN ), a little worse than O(N ), which
the threshold-based methods possess. However, practically, the
algorithm stops fairly quickly with few iterations. In addition,
the number of samples N is generally small (basically a few
hundred), and therefore the computational time should not be a
major issue while applying it to real data.
The string-structured assumption of pathways may be a soft
restriction on the use of M -scores and R-values. As mentioned
previously in Section II-B, the CPs in a Bayesian network represent contextual conditioning and crosstalk outsourced from
the model. When a nonroot node contains more than one known
parent affecting its activation, one could always consider those
branch nodes as external factors and incorporate their controlling contributions into the CP parameters, as long as the system
remains acyclic. Biologically, these additional parents may infer less control of the original parent over the child’s activation
and thus larger conditioning and crosstalk parameters. In these
cases, the targeted drug would be less efficient regardless of
CNAs and, as a result, application of M -scores and R-values
would be less valuable. On the other hands, when a nonleaf
node contains more than one child and forms a tree, one could
split the tree as several string-structured paths, as we did on
MYC and ELK in the RAS/MAPK pathway, if these paths can
be properly weighted.
Studies specifically designed for targeted therapies with comprehensive gene expression and copy number profiles are surprisingly limited. Because the survival data of the TCGA BRCA
samples are incomplete, there is a need for more rigorous experiments and studies to validate further these preliminary results.
Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 6(b) and (d), the error for CP
estimation can be large when the noise embedded in microarrays is not strictly controlled. Novel techniques such as nextgeneration sequencing may be necessary for better detection
and understanding of cancer therapies.
The mechanisms leading to different therapeutic responses
are very complicated and may involve many unknown factors
affecting signal transduction in biological pathways. The proposed M -score and R-value, as demonstrated in Section II,
can provide qualitative and quantitative information regarding
CNAs’ effects on drug effectiveness. These measures may be
suitably adjusted for unraveling other latent variables such as
pathway crosstalk to improve our knowledge of targeted therapy
and prolonging patients’ survival rates.
