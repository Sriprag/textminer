Abstract—Objective: This study aims to develop a new quantitative image feature analysis scheme and investigate its role along
with two genomic biomarkers, namely protein expression of the excision repair cross-complementing 1 genes and a regulatory subunit
of ribonucleotide reductase (RRM1), in predicting cancer recurrence risk of stage I nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients
after surgery. Methods: By using chest computed tomography images, we developed a computer-aided detection scheme to segment
lung tumors and computed tumor-related image features. After
feature selection, we trained a Naı̈ve Bayesian network-based classifier using eight image features and a multilayer perceptron classifier using two genomic biomarkers to predict cancer recurrence
risk, respectively. Two classifiers were trained and tested using a
dataset with 79 stage I NSCLC cases, a synthetic minority oversampling technique and a leave-one-case-out validation method.
A fusion method was also applied to combine prediction scores
of two classifiers. Results: Areas under ROC curves (AUC) values
are 0.78 ± 0.06 and 0.68 ± 0.07 when using the image feature
and genomic biomarker-based classifiers, respectively. AUC value
significantly increased to 0.84 ± 0.05 (p < 0.05) when fusion of
two classifier-generated prediction scores using an equal weighting
factor. Conclusion: A quantitative image feature-based classifier
yielded significantly higher discriminatory power than a genomic
biomarker-based classifier in predicting cancer recurrence risk.
Fusion of prediction scores generated by the two classifiers further
improved prediction performance. Significance: We demonstrated
a new approach that has potential to assist clinicians in more effectively managing stage I NSCLC patients to reduce cancer recurrence risk.

deaths in the United States (i.e., 28% for male and 26% for
female cancer patients [1]). In lung cancer, over 75% cases are
nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. Since lung is a relatively large human organ that may involve many other chronic
lung diseases, lung tumors can often grow for a long time before
they are found. Hence, the majority of lung cancers is currently
detected and diagnosed at the advanced stages with a lower survival rate. Therefore, great research and promotion effort has
been made to implement lung cancer screening programs using
the low-dose computed tomography (CT) imaging modality for
the last decade [2], [3]. In July 29, 2013, the U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force issued a draft recommendation in favor of
lung cancer screening for long-term smokers using low-dose
CT tests [4]. Meanwhile, the trend of using CT for screening
and/or detecting other lung diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive
pulmonary diseases) is also on the rise. As a result, more early
stage lung cancers (i.e., stage I NSCLC) are detected during the
regular lung cancer screening or other incident findings.
Although early cancer detection and treatment can improve
the survival rate of lung cancer patients, lung cancer recurrent
rates after surgical resection of the malignant tumors can range
from 30% to 60% as reported in the previous studies [5]. As
a result, mortality rate among the stage I NSCLC patients is
also much higher than many other types of cancers (e.g., breast
and colon cancer) detected at an early stage. According to the
statistical data reported from the National Cancer Institute’s
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Database, current
five-year survival rates are 49% and 45% for stage IA and stage
IB NSCLC patients, respectively [6]. Therefore, in order to more
effectively treat and manage the stage I NSCLC patients, it is
important to develop an effective clinical marker or prediction
model to more accurately predict cancer prognosis after cancer surgery. For the patients identified with the higher risk of
cancer recurrence, the specific chemotherapy should be applied
after surgery to minimize cancer recurrence risk.
Since there is no clinical standard for assessing the risk of
postsurgery cancer recurrence to date, researchers have explored
different genomic biomarkers to identify the molecular fingerprints of different genomic defects in lung cancer development
and prognosis [7]. Among them, two biomarkers, namely excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) gene product
and the regulatory subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RRM1),
have been extensively investigated and reported as prognostic
biomarkers of the NSCLC patients [8]–[10]. ERCC1 is a rate
limiting enzyme in the nucleotide excision repair and RRM1
functions as a regulatory subunit of ribonucleotide reductase

cancer recurrence of the stage I NSCLC patients after surgical
treatment. We also trained a classifier to combine two genomic
biomarkers (ERCC1 and RRM1). Using a receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) evaluation method, we assessed prediction
performance of using each of the image features and genomic
biomarkers as well as two multivariable-based machine learning classifiers. Finally, we investigated the potential to further
improve the prediction accuracy by applying a simple fusion
method to combine the prediction scores generated by the image feature and genomic biomarker-based classifiers.

A. Test Dataset

that controls the substrate specificity and the on/off function
of ribonucleotide reductase. In the clinical practice, these two
biomarkers are examined and measured by applying a standard
Immune histochemical (IHC) method to analyze the surgeryresected tumor tissue specimen. Studies have shown that high
expression of ERCC1 together with RRM1 often indicated an
improved outcome in NSCLC patients who are treated only with
surgical resection [11]. Thus, the researchers believe that comparative analyses between gene and IHC protein expression of
ERCC1 and RRM1 might define a useful genomic biomarker to
predict prognosis of the NSCLC patients [12].
Despite the promising results, using genomic biomarkers still
faces multiple challenges and has a number of limitations, such
as the higher cost, processing error in signal probing, and/or
subjective rating, as well as the lower specificity [13], [14].
Hence, radiographic imaging examinations still play a critical
role in current clinical practice for lung cancer detection, diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. Many advanced imaging modalities including high-resolution CT, positron emission tomography (PET), PET-CT, and magnetic resonance imaging [15]–[17]
have been investigated and used in lung cancer imaging. Among
them, CT remains the most popular imaging modality due to its
higher accuracy, wide accessibility, and cost effectiveness. However, reading and interpreting a large number of CT images of
a lung cancer case is difficult for radiologists. Using response
evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) guideline [18] to
subjectively measure tumor size in one dimension and evaluate
tumor size change during sequential CT examinations is often
not reliable (due to the interreader variability) and has lower
correlation to the clinical outcomes of the patients. Therefore,
there is an increasing interest in identifying novel quantitative
image markers computed from the CT images to predict cancer
prognosis [19], [20].
In this study, we investigated a new quantitative image analysis method to predict the risk of lung cancer recurrence of
the stage I NSCLC patients after lung cancer surgery. For this
purpose, we developed a new computer-aided detection (CAD)
scheme to automatically segment malignant tumors depicting on
CT images acquired before surgery and compute tumor-related
morphological, density, and texture-based image features. Using a set of the selected nonredundant image features, we trained
a Naı̈ve Bayesian network-based classifier to predict the risk of

The test dataset for this study was retrospectively acquired
under an institutional review board approved data collection
protocol from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China. The dataset includes images
of thoracic CT examinations of 79 patients who underwent lung
cancer diagnosis and treatment in the hospital. All of these patients were diagnosed with stage I NSCLC. Based on the current
clinical guideline, a lung surgery was performed on each patient
to resect malignant tumors. After surgery, the tumor specimens
were extracted. Two genomic biomarkers, ERCC1 and RRM1,
were evaluated using the selected tumor specimen and a standard IHC-based analytic method in the pathology laboratory of
the hospital.
In the ERCC1 protein expression test, the cells showed stained
yellow to brown color is defined as positive cell. Using a microscope, a technologist in the pathology laboratory examines
the IHC processed specimen to detect the colored cells and estimates the percentage of positive cells within the examined
specimen using a four-scale grading system in which white cell
is scored as 0, light yellow cell is 1, brown cell is 2, and dark
yellow cell is 3. Finally, based on the visually estimated percentage of stained colored cells, the technologist assigns an ERCC1
protein expression score for the case from 0 to 3, which indicate
that the percentage of estimated colored cells is 1) <10%, 2)
10% to 25%, 3) 26% to 50%, and 4) >50% for the four scoring
categories, respectively. The technologists also visually examine the specimen IHC probed for the RRM1 test and estimate the
percentage of cells that show the color sign of RRM1 expression. Each case is graded into two categories represented by the
technologists as either high (ࣙ50%) or low (<50%) in RRM1
cell expression. Table I shows the demographic information of
these 79 patients along with the corresponding subjectively assigned ERCC1 and RRM1 scores in the cases of this testing
dataset.
Among these 79 stage I NSCLC patients, 46 are male and 33
are female. The age of these patients ranged from 39 to 85 years
old. The average age is 61 years old with a standard deviation
of 9.05. Among these patients, 32 are younger than 60 years
old and 47 are older than 60 years old. Based on the available
patient follow-up data, these 79 patients were divided into two
groups of with and without cancer recurrence within the three
years after the lung cancer surgery. Specifically, 21 patients had
cancer recurrence and 58 remained progression or disease-free

values, identified tumor, and/or cancer cell characteristics.
All CT examinations were acquired using a 16-detector-based
Toshiba Aquilion CT machine. In CT image scanning protocol,
X-ray tube voltage ranged from 120 to 140 KV and the current ranged from 140 to 340 mAs depending on patient body
size. The CT image slices were reconstructed with an image
size of 512 × 512 pixels with pixel size ranged from 0.51 to
0.74 mm also depending on the patient body size. The image
slice thickness of all CT images in this dataset was 2 mm.

B. Lung Tumor Segmentation
We used a semiautomated computer-aided detection scheme
to segment lung tumors. In brief, the tumor center and diameter
that have been marked previously by a radiologist in the original
clinical CT image reading were used as the initial segmentation
seed in our CAD scheme. In each case, the image processing
of the scheme started from segmenting the tumor area from the
CT slice with the marks of the radiologist. The marked tumor
seed was mapped into next adjunct CT image slices to segment
the tumor area depicting on the next slices. This segmentation
process was iteratively performed until the scheme reached a
slice without remaining tumor area being detected. Specifically,
in each involved image slice, CAD scheme first applied a conventional region growing algorithm with an empirically selected
threshold of CT number (−450 HU). This step generally works
well in segmentation of well-circumscribed lung nodules.
However, this fixed region growing often did not provide
an accurate result in segmenting juxtapleural and vascularized
tumors, which connect with lung boundary and/or vessels. Thus,
the following two image processing steps were applied. First,
as shown in Fig. 1(a), by applying an initial region growing
algorithm, the segmented tumor has a leakage to outside lung
area [see Fig. 1(b)]. To segment this tumor, our scheme applied
a modified convex hull function-based algorithm introduced by
Kuhnigk et al. [21] to stop the leakage of the segmented tumor
area to the normal lung tissues and also smooth tumor boundary.

Based on an anatomical fact that a lung is mostly convex, this
algorithm is efficient and has good capability of removing the
thoracic lesions from the chest wall [see Fig. 1(c)]. However,
applying the convex hull function algorithm is also likely to
generate a few minor (isolated) regions due to image noise.
The scheme then applied a region labeling algorithm to remove
small regions, while maintaining the segmented tumor region
[see Fig. 1(d)].
Second, in order to cut and remove the connected vascular
structures from the tumor boundary, our scheme applied a distance map-based morphological operation as proposed by Kuhnigk et al. [21]. As shown in Fig. 2, after a juxtapleural tumor
[see Fig. 2(a)] was segmented using the initial region growing
algorithm and convex hull function, the scheme fitted a rectangular window to the initial tumor boundary [see Fig. 2(b)]. The
window was also centered on tumor center. The scheme applied
an Euclidean distance transform to convert the image inside the
window into a distance map E that contains the minimum distance of each pixel of the tumor region to the tumor boundary
pixels. Then, a seed optimization was done by searching for the
pixel C with the longest distance in the neighborhood of the
initial given seed, and a new radius for the tumor was calculated
based on this new seed
r = E(C).

preserved [see Fig. 2(e)]:
N ∗ = (N + ∩ N 2 ) \I δ .

(6)

After tumor segmentation, results were also visually reviewed
slice by slice. If an obvious leakage or any unremoved structures
attached to the tumor region were observed, a manual correction was applied in this tumor to set up a new initial boundary
condition, and the region growing algorithm was reapplied on
this slice to segment the tumor region. The similar semiautomated tumor segmentation and performance evaluation method
has been reported in the previous studies to segment lung nodules and breast masses to reduce or minimize the erroneous
measurement results of the feature values computed from the
images [22], [23].

Using this process, a normalized distance map É was
obtained

E = E/r.

(2)

As shown in Fig. 2(b), a small window was placed to cover
the targeted tumor on the CT image. If the region growing starts
from the center C, it reaches the boundary of the image through
the vasculature, and the result would not be a smoothly detected
tumor. In order to remove vascular connections, a distance-based
morphological operation was performed on the distance map.
The dilation and erosion were based on the shortest distance of
each pixel to the tumor boundary. To perform dilation and erosion, an adaptive threshold was calculated from the normalized
distance map É with the initial value of 1. The threshold was
lowered from 1 to a value with which the boundaries of the window were reached. The last threshold θ́ was used to calculate
the threshold θ for dilation and erosion
θ = r ∗ θ́.

Fig. 2(c) shows the eroded tumor N − , and Fig. 2(d) shows
the dilated tumor after erosion. The erosion was done by
N − = E > θ.

Then a second distance transform D was performed on N −
and the dilation was done by
N + = D < θ.

Last, the scheme refined the tumor segmentation boundary.
The image after the first segmentation was considered as N 0 ,
and the image after convex hull function was considered as
N 2 . Then, I = N 0 ∩ ∂N + was calculated and dilated with a
value of δ = 3, (∂N + is the boundary of N + ). As a result, the
tumor was segmented from the connected vascular trees, while
the unsmoothed tumor boundary contour or surface is largely

C. Quantitative Tumor Image Features
Our CAD scheme initially computed a set of 35 3-D tumor
volume-related morphological, CT number distribution, and
texture features from all involved CT image slices. In order to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space by removing redundant features and increase robustness of the multifeature-based
risk prediction model or classifier developed later in this study,
we used a CFS subset evaluator attribute selection in WEKA
data mining software package [24] with a best-first heuristic
feature search and selection method [25] to examine and filter
all features. We then selected the effective and nonredundant
features from the initial pool of 35 image features based on the
importance sorting of features in predicting the risk of cancer
recurrence. From the initial feature pool, eight image features
were selected by this feature selection method. The selected
features can be divided into two subgroups of five morphological and CT number distribution-based image features and three
tumor texture-based image features. The first subgroup includes
the following five image features.
1) Standard deviation of tumor pixel value (CT number): It
describes the degree of tumor density distribution and heterogeneity. The larger standard deviation of tumor pixel
values indicates greater tumor heterogeneity.
2) The maximum tumor diameter computed from the targeted
CT slice: This feature represents the maximum tumor size
in the tumor central slice, which is similar to that assessed
and measured using the RECIST guideline.
3) A tumor shape factor: The scheme first counts the number
of pixels located in the tumor boundary contour of all
segmented tumor regions on the related CT image slices.
Then, the tumor shape factor is computed by multiplying
this number to the unit of pixel size of the CT images
and dividing it by the tumor volume. The larger value
of this feature indicates the higher level of fluctuation or
irregularity on the tumor boundary surface.
4) The maximum CT number within the tumor volume: This
feature represents the highest density level of the tumor
and correlates to the highest tumor stiffness level, which
is another potentially important image feature associated
to the tumor prognosis as reported in previous study [26].

1038

5) Standard deviation of pixel values in central volume of
tumor: To compute this feature, we defined a tumor central
volume as a cubic volume that is centered in the tumor
center and has the length equal to the shortest radius of the
tumor. This feature quantifies the heterogeneity of tumor
density in the tumor center region.
Three texture features were computed from a gray-level runlength (GLRL) matrix of a tumor region based on the run-length
statistics. To compute GLRL features, the image grayscales were
reduced from 12 bits (0 to 4095) resolution to 8 bits (0 to
255). A run is defined as a sequence of pixels with intensity in
certain range of each bin, and run length is the length of that run
[27]. The GLRL was computed through a package developed
by Wei [28] using a zigzag method in four steps to: 1) determine
direction, 2) perform zigzag scan, 3) obtain new sequences, and
4) calculate run-length matrix. Specifically, the three texture
features selected by the best-first heuristic feature search and
selection method are as follows.
1) Gray-level
(GLN), F6 = GLN =
L G −1 nonuniformity
2
l=1 [
g =0 P (g, l) ], where l is the length of the
run, L is the maximum run length, g is gray-level bin, G
is the maximum number of gray-level bins, and P (g, l)
is the probability of the specific run length, respectively.
This feature value increases as the gray-level outliers
dominate the histogram.
2) Short-run low gray-level emphasis (SRLGE), F7 =
 −1 L
P (g ,l)
SRLGE = G
g =0
l=1 l 2 (g +l) 2 . It is a diagonal metric
that increases when the texture is dominated by many
short runs of low gray value.
3) Long-run low gray-level emphasis (LRLGE), F8 =
G −1 L P (g ,l)l 2
g =0
l=1 (g +l) 2 . It increases when the texture is
dominated by long runs that have low gray levels.
Since each texture feature had different values in four scanning directions (α = 0◦ , 90◦ , and ±45◦ ), each texture feature
computed in one CT image slice was represented by a mean of
the four feature values calculated along four directions. Finally,
a texture feature in a 3-D tumor volume was computed
 by a tumor region weighted summation method, F 3D = N
i=1 wi Fi ,
where N is the total number of CT image slices depicting the segmented tumor regions and wi is a weighting factor represented
by the size of tumor region in one CT slice.
D. Two Classifiers and Data Analysis
First, besides RRM1 that only has two binary (low or
high) groups, each of eight selected image features and
ERCC1 were first individually processed by using a maximumlikelihood-based ROC fitting program (ROCKIT, http://wwwradiology.uchicago.edu/krl/, University of Chicago) to compute
the area under a ROC curve (AUC). We used AUC as an assessment index to analyze and compare the performance of each
feature to predict or classify the test cases of our dataset into
two classes namely, positive (+) for cases with cancer recurrence after surgery within three years and negative (−) for cases
without cancer recurrence within three years. The correlation
coefficients of AUC values between applying these image features and ERCC1 were also computed and compared.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 63, NO. 5, MAY 2016

Second, we built a statistical machine learning classifier to
combine the eight selected image features and predict the risk
of a stage I NSCLC patient having cancer recurrence after cancer surgical treatment. Although many different machine learning classifiers [29] can be used for this purpose, in this study,
due to the limited test dataset, we built a simple Naı̈ve Bayesian
network-based classifier to reduce the potential risk of overtraining problem. The primary advantage of a Bayesian network is
that it can provide the flexibility for specifying the joint probability distribution of a problem domain by exploiting the dependencies between variables and capturing the uncertain knowledge
of a given problem in a natural and efficient way. The Bayesian
learning method has a long history to build a classifier by combining quantitative image and nonimage features to assist cancer
diagnosis [30], [31]. In this study, we used WEKA data mining
software package [24] to build the classifier. The classifier was
trained and tested using a standard leave-one-case-out validation method [32]. Due to the imbalanced number of cases in
the two classes (21 “positive” cancer recurrence cases versus 58
“negative” without cancer recurrence cases), in order to achieve
a more balanced optimization result in predicting the cases in
two classes, we applied a synthetic minority oversampling technique named SMOTE [33] to add synthetic data to double the
test cases in the “positive” class. Specifically, when using the
leave-one-case-out training and testing method, the classifier
was trained and tested 79 times. In each training/testing process cycle, one case was removed from the training dataset. The
SMOTE algorithm was applied to double the number of “positive” cases based on the distribution of 78 cases in the training
dataset. The trained/optimized classifier was then applied to a
test case that was not involved in the SMOTE-based synthetic
data generation and classifier training process. This training
and testing process was iteratively performed 79 times, which,
thus, produces risk prediction scores (which are normalized in
a range from 0 to 1) for all 79 cases in our dataset. The higher
score indicates the higher risk of the patient having cancer recurrence within the three years after lung cancer surgery. Finally,
we computed AUC value using these 79 prediction scores and
the ROCKIT program.
Third, we also applied a machine learning classifier to combine two genomic biomarkers of ERCC1 and RRM1 for predicting lung cancer recurrence risk. We trained and tested the
same Naı̈ve Bayesian network-based classifier as used for CT
image features. Probably due to only two variables and limited discrete status (two for RRM1), the Naı̈ve Bayesian network classifier yielded a significantly lower prediction performance as compared to using ERCC1 only (which will be
reported in Section III). Thus, we also built and tested a
simple Multilayer perceptron-based classifier to combine the
two genomic biomarkers, which yielded significantly higher
performance. The training and testing process was also used
by the same WEKA data mining software package, SMOTE
synthetic data generation algorithm, leave-one-case-out validation method, and the ROCKIT program as discussed in training
and testing the image feature-based classifiers.
Fourth, after comparing the prediction performance between
the quantitative image feature-based classifier and the two

EMAMINEJAD et al.: FUSION OF QUANTITATIVE IMAGE AND GENOMIC BIOMARKERS TO IMPROVE PROGNOSIS ASSESSMENT

genomic biomarker-based classifiers, we applied several data
fusion methods [34] (including the maximum, minimum, and
weighting average) to combine the prediction risk scores generated by these two classifiers and test the feasibility of further
improving performance in predicting risk of cancer recurrence.
The fusion result was also compared with those yielded using
two individual classifiers.
Fifth, since in clinical practice, the radiologists and/or oncologists make a binary decision on image reading, cancer diagnosis, prognosis assessment, and selection of treatment option,
besides AUC values, we also assessed and compared the prediction accuracy, positive, and negative predictive values based
on the confusion matrix built by selecting an optimal operation
threshold to divide the cases into two binary categories (with
and without cancer recurrence). For this purpose, we grouped
the cases with lower ERCC1 gene expression (0 and 1) into
one group and cases with higher ERCC1 (2 and 3) into another
group. We also applied a default operation threshold of 0.5 on
the middle point of the prediction scores (0 to 1) generated
by the image feature-based classifier to divide the cases into
the high- and low-risk case groups. As a result, we built three
confusion matrices based on ERCC1, RRM1, and quantitative
image feature analysis classifier, respectively. We then compared the prediction accuracy between using the quantitative
image features and the two genomic biomarkers.
Finally, we also applied and tested several other statistical
data analysis models to measure and assess the association between the model predicted high or low risk scores in cancer
recurrence and patients’ DFS, which include 1) a Chi-squared
test, 2) Kaplan–Meier plots, and 3) Cox proportional hazards regression models. In the Chi-squared test, we divided cases into
two groups by applying a threshold of 18 months, which is the
middle point of 36 months (three year) tracking period, while in
using Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression models, the cases were
divided into two groups of low and high risk in cancer recurrence by applying an operation threshold of 0.5 to the prediction
scores generated by (1) the image feature-based classifier, (2)
the genomic biomarker-based classifier, or (3) the fusion model
of two classifiers.
III. RESULTS
Table III summarizes and compares the computed AUC values using each of the eight image features and one biomarker of
ERCC1. The results show that image feature 2 (the maximum
tumor diameter) and ERCC1 yielded the maximum and quite
comparable AUC values. Table IV summarizes the correlation
coefficients between each pair of image features, as well as the
correlation coefficients between each image feature and each genomic biomarker (ERCC1 and RRM1). Except image features
1 and 2 (tumor CT value standard deviation and tumor size),
the absolute values of all other correlation coefficients are much
smaller than r < 0.5, which indicates that these features are not
highly correlated or redundant. Thus, the result supports that the
combination of this set of image features has potential to add
supplementary information or discriminatory power to significantly increase performance of predicting the risk of lung cancer
recurrence than using a single image feature or biomarker.

The image feature-based Naı̈ve Bayesian network classifier
yielded an AUC = 0.78 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of

yielded an AUC = 0.68 with a 95% CI of [0.56, 0.79]. Table V

the weighting factor from 0.1 to 0.9 applied to the prediction
scores generated by the image feature-based classifier (or 0.9
to 0.1 applied to the prediction scores generated by the two
genomic biomarker-based classifier). The test results showed
that the maximum AUC = 0.84 ± 0.05, which is significantly
higher than the AUC values generated using either image feature or the genomic biomarker-based classifier (p < 0.05) as
computed by ROCKIT program. Fig. 3 shows and compares

result generated using the image feature-based classifier have
a significantly higher prediction power than using the genomic
biomarker-based classifier.
IV. DISCUSSION
The study has a number of unique characteristics. First, although many different types of CAD schemes of chest CT images has been previously developed and tested (e.g., [35]–[37]),
in this study we explored a new approach of applying a CADbased quantitative image analysis concept to a new application
field of predicting cancer recurrence risk. Since the ultimate
goal of current promotion of lung cancer screening using lowdose CT imaging examinations is to reduce the cancer mortality
rate, this study investigated a clinically significant issue of how
to more accurately predict cancer recurrence risk after initial
surgery among the stage I NSCLC patients. Our study results
demonstrated the feasibility of developing a new CAD scheme

to predict the risk of cancer recurrence, which may eventually
help to improve the efficacy of lung cancer screening programs,
cancer treatment, and patient management.
Second, we investigated a number of new image features
computed from CT images and built a machine learning classifier to predict lung cancer recurrence risk. Then, using a bestfirst heuristic feature searching algorithm, eight image features
were selected from an initial pool of 35 features, which include
five morphological and pixel value related features and three
texture-based features. The physical meaning of these five morphological and pixel value-based image features can be well
described to mimic the image features used by radiologists to
assess and interpret tumors in the clinical practice. In our study,
the tumor diameter (feature 2) yielded the highest AUC value
(see Table III), which correlates well with the RECIST guideline. However, this study also showed that optimally combining

multiple image features using a classifier can further significantly increase prediction performance (AUC value). This is a
major advantage of applying a CAD scheme over the human
observers. Besides the tumor size, the classifier also includes
a number of other sensitive image features to the human observers, such as irregularity of tumor boundary surface, and
the heterogeneity of tumor density (or stiffness). Both features
are important, in particular, tumor stiffness has recently been
attracting research interests because cancer biology and oncology studies have identified that tumor stiffness is a very important biomechanical property of tumors, which relates to the
elasticity level of the tumor tissue and affects tumor progression or response to chemotherapy [26], [38]. Although human
observers can also subjectively assess many of tumor-related
image features individually, it is much more difficult for them
to consistently integrate these features into a decision making
process. Quantitative image feature analysis can be more efficient and reliable to integrate these features by eliminating
inter- and intraobserver variations. Also, due to the difference
between human vision and computer vision, the meaning of
many texture-based features (e.g., the GRLR features) may not
easily correlate to human perception. However, texture-based
image features have been widely used in many CAD schemes
to detect and/or classify between malignant and benign or falsepositive lesions. Thus, adding the texture-based features also

1042

expands the capability of assessing cancer prognosis in CAD
schemes.
Third, in the previously reported studies that aim to predict
cancer prognosis, researcher has investigated a large number of
genomic biomarkers, demographic, and other clinical factors to
predict cancer prognosis or patient survival rates. Among them,
ERCC1 and RRM1 are two popular biomarkers that have been
investigated to assess lung cancer prognosis including stage I
NSCLC patients. In this study, we compared the risk prediction performance of our new quantitative image analysis results with ERCC1 and RRM1 biomarkers. When applying to
the same testing dataset, we found that ERCC1 yielded a quite
comparable AUC value in predicting cancer recurrence as the
“highest performed” image feature selected in this study (see
Table III). Although our study results support that these two genomic biomarkers have statistically significant association with
the prognosis of the lung cancer patients (DFS), their absolute prediction accuracy or discriminatory power (i.e., positive
and/or negative predictive value) on the individual patient level
remains lower (see Table VI). Our study results demonstrated
that using a quantitative image feature-based prediction model
yielded significantly high prediction accuracy than using each
of these two genomic biomarkers.
Fourth, currently, the biomedical imaging research and
the biological or genetic research are typically conducted
separately by the researchers in different fields. Identifying the
association between the quantitative image features and the genomic biomarkers has attracted wide research interest in an
emerging developing field of Radiomics recently [20]. In this
study, we investigated the correlations between the image features and two genomic biomarkers. We applied a simple fusion
method to combine the image phenotype and genotype features
or biomarkers to predict lung cancer recurrence risk. The study
results demonstrated that the quantitative CT image features
and two popular genomic biomarkers provided supplementary
discriminatory information in cancer prognosis assessment. As
a result, combining the prediction results generated using the
image feature and genomic biomarker-based classifiers further
improved the risk prediction performance than using either of
the single classifiers.
From this study, we also performed several additional experiments and observed a number of interesting results. First, optimal feature selection is important in developing a CAD-based
quantitative image feature analysis scheme. Training a Naı̈ve
Bayesian network with all 35 features yielded a substantially
lower performance (AUC = 0.54 with 95% CI of [0.36, 0.71])
than the classifier trained using eight selected image features (as
shown in Fig. 3).
Second, when using the original dataset of 79 cases to
train two classifiers, the image feature-based classifier yielded
AUC = 0.71 with a 95% CI of [0.57, 0.82] and the genomic
biomarker-based classifiers yielded AUC = 0.54 with 95% CI
of [0.40, 0.67]. The results showed a significant advantage of
using a SMOTE method to generate synthetic data and balance
the number of training cases in the two risk classes in training
and testing a machine learning classifier.
Third, we tested the performance by fusion of the normalized
ERCC1 scores (from 0 to 1) and the prediction scores generated

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 63, NO. 5, MAY 2016

by the image feature-based classifier. The highest obtained AUC
value was 0.78 with 95% CI of [0.66, 0.88], which is lower than
the highest AUC value yielded by fusion of the prediction scores
of two classifiers (see Table V).
Fourth, we also trained and tested two classifiers that used
eight image features and two genomic biomarkers together as
the input features. The results showed that a Naı̈ve Bayesian
classifier yielded an AUC of 0.77 with 95% CI of [0.64, 0.88]
and a Multilayer perceptron classifier yielded an AUC of 0.71
with 95% CI of [0.58, 0.82]. These AUC values were also lower
than the highest AUC value yielded by fusion of the prediction
scores of two classifiers as reported in Table V.
Despite the promising results, we also recognized that this
was our first preliminary study with a number of limitations.
First, this was a retrospective study with a small dataset. The
retrieved study materials and information only included the existing CT images, two genomic biomarker testing results, and
three-year DFS. Hence, the robustness of the reported results in
this study needs to be tested and validated in future with both the
retrospective studies with large image datasets collected from
different medical institutions and the prospective studies that
include more detailed clinical information (i.e., clear margins
and/or extent of the surgery of the tumors) and the longer DFS
data (e.g., five years).
Second, we only explored and computed 35 tumor-related image features in this study. Other lung tissue background image
features (i.e., features related to the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other lung diseases), which may also provide
supplementary prediction information, have not been incorporated into our image feature analysis scheme.
Third, from the existing genomic biomarkers of lung cancer,
our dataset only has the test records of two popular biomarkers (ERCC1 and RRM1). Many of the other existing genomic
biomarkers, the potentially useful clinical markers (i.e., the
clearance of tumor margin by the surgeons) and epidemiologybased risk factors have not been compared with our image features or integrated into our fusion models. Hence, more studies
are needed to more effectively integrate image features and other
useful biomarkers or risk factors.
Fourth, in this study, we performed a semiautomatic scheme
to segment lung tumors. The segmentation results were visually
examined. As a result, a small fraction of tumor segmentation boundary contours (<5%) were manually corrected when
the substantial errors were visually detected. Due to the lack
of a “ground-truth” and the potential interobserver variability,
we recognize that this is not an optimal tumor segmentation
method and may create errors in computing tumor-related image features. However, we believe that this semiautomated tumor segmentation is an efficient approach to perform this proofof-concept study. Developing more accurate and reliable CAD
schemes for tumor segmentation is still one of research focuses
in future studies.
Last, this is only a technology development study. Its clinical relevance or whether and how to optimally apply this new
CAD-based quantitative image feature analysis scheme to assist
decision-making of the clinicians (i.e., radiologists and/or oncologists) in the clinical practice has not been investigated and
tested to date.

V. CONCLUSION
Developing precision medicine [39] or a more effective personalized strategy for treating and managing stage I NSCLC
patients requires a more accurate clinical marker and/or assessment tool to predict cancer prognosis (including cancer recurrence risk). Current studies mainly focus on identifying more
effective genomic biomarkers, demographic factors, and other
clinical variables. In this study, we investigated a new quantitative image feature analysis approach using chest CT images and
demonstrated two new study results. First, an image featurebased classifier yielded significantly higher performance than
two popular genomic biomarkers in predicting cancer recurrence risk. Second, the image features and genomic biomarkers
are not highly correlated and provide supplementary information. As a result, fusion of these two types of features and
biomarkers further improved prediction performance.
Despite the limitations, this preliminary study provides us a
valid foundation to continue working in this new and promising
CAD field to develop and optimize highly performed and robust
risk prediction schemes that may have potential to eventually
assist clinicians in more accurately identifying the patients with
a higher risk of lung cancer recurrence after surgery. Therefore,
for these high-risk patients, the postsurgery chemotherapy is
required to prevent or minimize the risk of cancer recurrence,
and, thus, increase their DFS and overall survival time.
