A Hybrid BCI System Combining P300 and SSVEP
and Its Application to Wheelchair Control

Abstract—In this paper, a hybrid brain–computer interface
(BCI) system combining P300 and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is proposed to improve the performance of asynchronous control. The four groups of flickering buttons were set
in the graphical user interface. Each group contained one large
button in the center and eight small buttons around it, all of which
flashed at a fixed frequency (e.g., 7.5 Hz) to evoke SSVEP. At the
same time, the four large buttons of the four groups were intensified through shape and color changes in a random order to produce
P300 potential. During the control state, the user focused on a desired group of buttons (target buttons) to evoke P300 potential and
SSVEP, simultaneously. Discrimination between the control and
idle states was based on the detection of both P300 and SSVEP
on the same group of buttons. As an application, this method was
used to produce a “go/stop” command in real-time wheelchair control. Several experiments were conducted, and data analysis results
showed that combining P300 potential and SSVEP significantly improved the performance of the BCI system in terms of detection
accuracy and response time.

I. INTRODUCTION
BRAIN–COMPUTER interface (BCI) system enables direct communication with an external device but does not
use peripheral nerves or muscles [1]. Common brain activity patterns used in electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCIs
include P300 potentials [2], steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) [3], and motor imagery (MI) [4]. The BCI control may be asynchronous or synchronous. In asynchronous
BCIs, an important problem is to distinguish the control and
idle states promptly and accurately based on ongoing EEG

signals [5]. Many studies have addressed the issue of asynchronous BCIs based on MI [6]–[10], SSVEP [11]–[13], P300
potential [14], [15]. Many studies have addressed the issue of
asynchronous BCIs based on MI [6]–[10], SSVEP [11]–[13],
P300 potential [14], [15]. N200 is a negative peak around 200 ms
following the presentation of a visual motion stimuli, which can
be used in BCIs [16], [17]. Recently, zhang et al. developed
an asynchronous BCI speller using N200 potential [18]. The
performance of an asynchronous BCI can be measured by the
true positive rate (TPR) during the control state and the false
positive rate (FPR) during the idle state. Thus, researchers strive
not only to improve the TPR in the control state, but also to keep
the FPR as low as possible in the idle state.
Recent work has validated hybrid BCIs as a new type of
approach for this purpose. A hybrid BCI is composed of two
or more BCIs. This BCI detects at least two brain patterns in
a simultaneous [19]–[24] or sequential manner [25]–[27]. With
the use of two or more brain patterns, hybrid BCIs can achieve
specific goals more effectively than conventional BCI systems
[28]. For example, Allison et al. demonstrated that by detecting
MI and SSVEP simultaneously, classification accuracy can be
improved, especially for BCI-blind subjects [19]. Pfurtscheller
et al. proposed a hybrid BCI, where an MI-based brain switch
was used to turn ON/OFf an SSVEP-based BCI [25]. In our
previous studies, we presented a hybrid BCI that combined
MI and P300 potential for multidimensional control, e.g., 2-D
cursor control [20], [29], [30] or the direction and speed control
of a simulated or actual wheelchair [23], where one dimension
was controlled by mu/beta rhythms and the other dimension was
controlled by P300.
The concept of a hybrid BCI combining P300 and SSVEP was
first proposed in [31]. Recently, there have been a few related
studies [24], [27]. In [27], P300 and SSVEP were combined in
an asynchronous hybrid BCI speller, in which all buttons in the
GUI flickered from black to white at 17.7 Hz to elicit SSVEP
while all the rows and columns flashed in orange in a random
order to elicit P300 potential. The control state detection was
accomplished by using SSVEP and the target button recognition was accomplished by using P300 potential. Yin et al. [24]
proposed a synchronous hybrid BCI speller, in which P300 and
SSVEP were combined for target button recognition. During
the experiment, each button of the 6 × 6 matrix flickered at
a frequency between white and black to produce SSVEP and
only six frequencies were used in the matrix. At the same time,
the 6 rows and 6 columns of the matrix were highlighted by
orange crosses in a random order to produce P300 potential.
Since this hybrid BCI system was synchronous, the control/idle
state detection was not necessary.

LI et al.: HYBRID BCI SYSTEM COMBINING P300 AND SSVEP AND ITS APPLICATION TO WHEELCHAIR CONTROL

In an asynchronous BCI system, a key is the control/idle
state detection. For instance, for a real-time BCI-controlled
wheelchair, it is both important and difficult to have a stop
command, which must be elicited as promptly and accurately
as possible. The stop command can be implemented by the control state detection in an asynchronous BCI system. To the best
of our knowledge, only one BCI study [32] has utilized a stop
command for wheelchair control. In [32], the user first selected
a destination using a P300-based BCI and the wheelchair subsequently moved to the destination automatically. During the
experiment, the user could stop the wheelchair using a P300based or MI-based asynchronous BCI. Considering the relative low response speed of a P300-based asynchronous BCI, it
might not be a good choice for producing the stop command
of a wheelchair. Although the response of MI-based BCIs is
fast, it is often used for direction control of a wheelchair [23].
Thus, we need to develop new asynchronous BCI paradigms to
implement the stop command of a wheelchair.
In this paper, we propose a new hybrid BCI that simultaneously combines P300 and SSVEP to improve the performance
of asynchronous control. Four groups of buttons are displayed
on the GUI, and each group contains one large button in the center and eight small buttons surrounding it. All buttons in each
group flicker at a fixed frequency (e.g., 7.5 Hz) to evoke SSVEP,
with the four groups correspond to four different frequencies. At
the same time, the four large buttons of the four groups flash in
a random order to evoke P300 potential. When the user focuses
on one group of buttons, both P300 potential and SSVEP can be
elicited simultaneously. The system detects the control/idle state
and further recognizes the target by determining whether both
P300 and SSVEP occur in the same group of buttons. As an application, we use this method to produce “go/stop” commands in
wheelchair control. Three experiments involving eight subjects
are conducted to validate our approach and system. The data
analysis results demonstrate that our hybrid BCI outperforms
the P300-based or SSVEP-based BCIs in terms of accuracy and
the response time (RT) of the asynchronous control.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Methodologies including the data acquisition system, GUI and control
mechanism, models and algorithms are presented in Section II.
Experimental results are presented in Section III. Further data
analysis and discussions are presented in Sections IV. Section V
concludes the paper.
II. METHODS
A. Data Acquisition System
A NuAmps device (Compumedics, Neuroscan, Inc., Abbotsford, Australia) was used to capture scalp EEG signals for data
acquisition. Each user wears an EEG cap (LT 37) with Ag–AgCl
electrodes, as shown in Fig. 1. The EEG signals are referenced
to the right mastoid. Two channels, “HEOG” and “VEOG”, for
eye movements were excluded, and are not shown here. As previously described [33], [34], the EEG signals used for analysis
were recorded from 10 electrodes (“Fz,” “Cz,” “P7,” “P3,” “Pz,”
“P4,” “P8,” “O1,” “Oz,” and “O2”), which are marked in red in
Fig. 1. The impedances of all electrodes were kept below 5 kΩ.

frequencies by changing color between black and red. Specifically, the top, right,
bottom, and left groups correspond to 6.0, 6.67, 7.5, and 8.57 Hz, respectively.
(b) Large buttons of the four groups are intensified with a rectangular shape
and green color in a random order. When a large button is intensified, a number
appears on the button. The top, right, bottom, and left groups correspond to 1,
2, 3, and 4, respectively.

EEG signals were amplified, sampled at 250 Hz, and band-pass
filtered between 0.1 and 30 Hz.
B. Graphical User Interface and Control Mechanism
The graphical user interface (GUI) used in this study is illustrated in Fig. 2. Four groups of buttons corresponding to the
numbers “1,” “2,” “3,” and “4” were located at the top, right,

other for SSVEP detection. Next, the two detection outputs are merged in a postprocessing step.

bottom, and left side of the GUI, respectively. For each group,
eight small buttons were arranged every 45◦ in a peripheral circle with a 60 mm radius around one large button. The ratios of
the sizes of the small buttons, large button, and GUI were fixed
at 0.003: 0.02:1. Button groups 1–4 flickered at frequencies of
6.0, 6.67, 7.5, and 8.57 Hz, respectively. Meanwhile, the large
buttons of the four groups were intensified in a random order,
with each intensification lasting 100 ms with a 100 ms interval
between two consecutive flashes. Thus, one round of intensifications of the four large buttons lasted 800 ms (one round is
defined here as a complete cycle in which each large button
flashes once). With the exception of the 100 ms period of intensification, each large button continued to flicker at its fixed
frequency. In this manner, both SSVEP and P300 potential were
elicited simultaneously.
Two brain states, control and idle, are discriminated in our
system. The former state indicates that the user is paying attention to a group of buttons, and the latter implies that the user
is not focusing on any button. When the user wants to input a
number, he/she focuses on the corresponding button by counting
its flashes. With such an interface, P300 potential can be elicited
by flashes of the target button and SSVEP can be elicited by the
group of flickering buttons. Once both the P300 potential and
SSVEP are detected for the same group of buttons, the system
outputs the corresponding number.
C. Data Processing and Algorithm
The P300 and SSVEP detectors were designed separately.
The EEG data were copied and then fed into the two detection
procedures simultaneously. Fig. 3 shows the data procedure for
both the P300 and SSVEP detections. The analysis methods and
algorithms used in this study are described next.
1) P300 Potential Detection: First, the EEG signals are filtered between 0.1 and 10 Hz. Then, we extract a segment (0–
600 ms after a button flash) of EEG signals from each channel for
each button flash. This segment is downsampled by a rate of 5 to
obtain a data vector from each channel. The obtained data vector
is denoted as Dai,j,k , where i, j, and k represent the ith channel,
jth button associated with this flash, and kth round, respectively.
Dai,j,k will contain a P300 waveform if the user is paying attention to this button. Next, we concatenate the vectors Dai,j,k
from all 10 channels, i.e., F ej,k = [Da1,j,k , . . . , Da10,j,k ].

Finally, we construct a feature vector corresponding to the jth
button by averaging the vectors F ej,k from all k rounds, i.e.,
F ej = (F ej,1 + . . . + F ej,k )/k.
Using the feature vectors in the training dataset and their
corresponding labels, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier
was trained for each subject. If the subject is focusing on the
jth button, then the label of F ej is 1, while the label of F eu
(u = j) is -1. The SVM classifier was then used as the online
P300 detector.
In the asynchronous algorithm, the detection of P300 is accomplished every 800 ms, corresponding to one round of button
flashes. The feature vectors F ej (j = 1, . . . , 4) are obtained
by averaging the last 4 rounds data vectors corresponding to 4
rounds of button flashes from the current time point. Applying
the trained SVM classifier to these feature vectors, we obtain
four scores (the values of the objective function of the SVM),
denoted as sj (j = 1, . . . , 4) for the four buttons. Finally, we
normalize the four scores by mapping them to the range [0,1]
and find the index of the maximum score
ŝj =

sj − min{s1 , . . . , s4 }
max{s1 , . . . , s4 } − min{s1 , . . . , s4 }

rp300 = arg max(ŝj ).

(1)
(2)

j

The four normalized scores ŝj (j = 1, . . . , 4) and the index
of the maximum score rp300 representing the output of P300
detection are used in the decision-making step described later.
2) SSVEP Detection: SSVEP detection is performed every
200 ms. First, the EEG signals are filtered within the range of 3–
20 Hz. Then, we extract the segment of EEG signals from eight
channels (“P7,” “P3,” “Pz,” “P4,” “P8,” “O1,” “Oz,” and “O2”) in
the 3.2 s period (800 data points) before the current time point.
For each segment, we use the minimum energy combination
(MEC) to combine the signals from multiple channels [34]. The
signal vector ȳ is defined as the weighted combination of the
channel signals
ȳ =

Ny


wi yi

(3)

i=1

where yi is the ith channel signal, Ny is the number of channels
(Ny = 8 in this study), and w = [w1 , . . . , wN y ] is a weight
vector. Through the MEC method, Ny weight vectors denoted
as w1 , . . . , wN y are obtained, which are in ascending order

LI et al.: HYBRID BCI SYSTEM COMBINING P300 AND SSVEP AND ITS APPLICATION TO WHEELCHAIR CONTROL

according to their energy values. Furthermore, new Ny signals
are created using these weight vectors as in (3). We select the
first N̄y of the newly defined Ny signals such that approximately
90% of the nuisance signal energy is discarded. The details of
this process are provided in [34].
a) Classification: SSVEP detection is based on the N̄y
signals obtained in the manner described previously. Using a
discrete Fourier transform, we calculate the power density spectrum for each N̄y signals. During the Fourier analysis, we used
zero padding method to increase the number of data points to
1024 (a power of 2). The power density spectrum for the jth
signal is denoted as P (j, f ), where f represents frequency. We
further calculate the power of the SSVEP response for the ith
group of buttons as shown as follows:
j = N̄ y
1 
P̂ (f ) =
[P (j, f ) + P (j, 2f )]
2N̄y j =1

(4)

where P (j, 2f ) is a harmonic.
Based on (4), the power of the SSVEP response for the ith
group of buttons is P̂ (fi ), where fi is the flickering frequency.
Furthermore, the power ratio for the ith group of flickering
buttons is defined as
δi =

[P̂ (f )]f ∈[f i −f n ,f i +f n ]
[P̂ (f )]f ∈[f i −f w ,f i +f w ]

(5)

where [P̂ (f )]f ∈[f i −f n ,f i +f n ] is the mean power in the narrow
band [fi − fn , fi + fn ], and [P̂ (f )]f ∈[f i −f w ,f i +f w ] is the mean
power in the wide band [fi − fw , fi + fw ]. In this study, the
band width parameters fn and fw are set at 0.2 and 1 Hz,
respectively.
Finally, we normalize the four power ratios corresponding to
the four groups of buttons to the range [0,1] and find the index
of the maximum normalized power ratio
δ̂i =

δi − min{δ1 , . . . , δ4 }
max{δ1 , . . . , δ4 } − min{δ1 , . . . , δ4 }

rssvep = arg max(δ̂i ).

(6)
(7)

i

The four normalized ratios δ̂i (i = 1, . . . , 4) and the index
of maximum ratio rssvep representing the output of SSVEP
detection are used in the decision-making step described next.
3) Decision Making: Combining the outputs of the individual P300 and SSVEP detections, we perform the discrimination
between the control and idle states, and determine the target.
We first check the following Condition 1, and then check the
following Condition 2 if Condition 1 is not satisfied.
Condition 1: during P300 or SSVEP detection, we first calculate the sum of the normalized SVM scores and normalized
power ratios for each group of buttons, and then find the maximum and second maximum of the four summed values as shown
as follows:
ci = ŝi + δ̂i , i = 1, . . . 4
ci 0 = max{c1 , . . . , c4 }
ci 1 = max{{c1 , . . . , c4 }\{ci 0 }}

(8)

3159

where ŝi and δ̂i are calculated in (1) and (6), and i0 and i1 are the
indices corresponding to the maximum and second maximum
of the summed values, respectively.
We now define a threshold condition by comparing the aforementioned maximum and the second maximum
ci 0 − ci 1
> θ0
(9)
ci 1
where the threshold θ0 is a predefined positive constant, which
can be chosen by a receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
curve obtained in our offline experiment (see Experiment 1).
If the above threshold condition is satisfied, then the system
sends a control command corresponding to the i0 th group of
buttons. Otherwise, the system checks for the following second
threshold condition.
Condition 2: the indexes rp300 calculated by (2) and rssvep
calculated by (7) correspond to the groups of buttons recognized
in the P300 and SSVEP detections, respectively. A dwell time
parameter is set to the second threshold condition, i.e., the same
group of buttons is recognized by both the P300 and SSVEP
detections simultaneously for a predefined number of consecutive times. The dwell parameter was empirically set to three
times for all subjects in this paper. For example, if one group
of buttons are recognized for consecutive three times simultaneously by both the p300 and SSVEP detections, then a control
command corresponding to this group of buttons is sent out.
When the first condition is satisfied, or the above second
criterion is satisfied when the first does not hold, the system
sends out a control command corresponding to the recognized
group of buttons.
III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
Three experiments including one offline experiment and two
online experiments were conducted in this study. Eight 20 to
31-year-old healthy subjects from the local research unit attended the experiments. Before the experiments, each subject
attended a P300 training session of 30 trials with the GUI in
Fig. 2. Specifically, in each trial, all four buttons flashed in a
random order and each button flashed ten times. Simultaneously, the subject was instructed to focus his/her attention on
a given target button. Data were collected to construct a P300
classification model for the next three experiments.
A. Experiment 1: ROC Curve Calculation
The aim of the first experiment was to calculate the ROC
curves and evaluate the performance of our asynchronous BCI.
We conducted three sessions for the proposed hybrid P300
and SSVEP-based BCI (see Fig. 2), a P300-based BCI [see
Fig. 4(a)], and an SSVEP-based BCI [see Fig. 4(b)]. Each session was composed of 80 trials, with the data collection and
processing explained next.
Fig. 5 illustrates the paradigm for Experiment 1. At the beginning of each trial, a beep would catch the subject’s attention.
After 2 s, one of the cues “1,” “2,” “3,” “4,” or “idle” would appear for 2 s on the center of GUI, with digit cues indicating the
target groups of buttons of the control state, and the cue “idle”

SSVEP-based BCI. The top, right, bottom, and left groups of buttons flicker at

Fig. 5. Paradigm of a trial in Experiment 1. At the beginning of each trial,
a beep caught the subject’s attention. After 2 s, if cue “1,” “2,” “3,” or “4”
appeared, the subjects were asked to focus on the corresponding target for 16 s.
Otherwise, the cue “idle” appeared for 2 s, and the subjects were asked to rest
for 16 s without paying attention to any buttons.

indicating the idle state. During the control state, the subjects
were instructed to focus on the target group of buttons for 16 s
through 20 rounds of button flashes (one round is defined as a
complete cycle in which each large button flashes once). During
the idle state, the subjects were asked to rest for 16 s without
paying attention to any buttons. There was a 2 s break between consecutive trials. The control and idle trials alternatively
appeared.
TPR and FPR are appropriate measures to evaluate the performance of asynchronous BCIs. In this paper, the correct recognition of a target button is considered as a true positive (TP),
and TPR indicates how many true positives (in the control state)
the system is able to detect on average within a time unit (e.g.,

1 min). Furthermore, misclassifying an idle state as a control
state is a false positive (FP), and FPR indicates how many false
positives (in the idle state) the system will detect on average
within a time unit. The ROC curves depict the relation between
the two rates of TPR and FPR. We used these datasets to calculate three ROC curves corresponding to the three sessions, and
to assess system performance. Fig. 6 shows the ROC curves for
all subjects. As seen in Fig. 6, the performance in terms of the
area under the ROC curve is superior for the hybrid BCI than
for the P300-based or SSVEP-based BCIs.
Next, we used the dataset collected in the hybrid session to
define the threshold for online experiments. In an actual application, one must find a threshold according to a criterion, e.g.,
to achieve a satisfactory TPR while keeping FPR below a given
limit. In [35], it was noted that a low FPR is necessary to keep
the average time between two consecutive false positives longer
than 30 s. In this paper, we chose the threshold such that the
FPR value was equal to 0.6 events/min, corresponding to a false
positive every 100 s on average. In this case, the proposed hybrid P300 and SSVEP-based BCI is able to achieve TPR in the
range 10–17 events/min for all subjects.
Totally, a subject performed 80 trials. In each trial, the output
was one of the four buttons or “idle.” A correct trial implied
that the subject produced a correct output in this trial according to the instruction provided by the system. The accuracy
rate was the ratio of the number of correct trials and the total
number of trials. Using different thresholds, we calculated the
corresponding accuracy rates. Fig. 7 depicts the accuracy rates
at different thresholds for all eight subjects, where the black,
cyan, and magenta curves correspond to the P300, the SSVEP,
and hybrid sessions, respectively. For each type of BCIs, the accuracy rates increase with the threshold at the beginning. After
reaching the maximum, the accuracy rates generally decrease.
In Fig. 7, we can see that the hybrid BCI achieved the highest
maximum accuracy for all subjects.
Furthermore, to check whether the detection is actually driven
by both hybrid features, the ERP waveforms and power spectra
of subjects S1 and S2 are calculated using the data collected
in the hybrid session of Experiment 1. For the target group of
buttons in the control state, ERP waveforms were obtained from
0 to 800 ms after the onset of stimulus by averaging 40 control
trials. Fig. 8 shows the EEG signal amplitudes of the channels
“Pz,” “Oz,” “O1,” and “O2” for subjects S1 and S2, where the
solid red curves containing P300 correspond to the target button and the dashed blue curves without P300 correspond to the
nontarget button. Interestingly, besides the P300 component, an
evident negative potential at about 200 ms appeared in the target
curves. This negative potential was recognized as N200 reflecting the subject’s visual motion-onset response [16]. Moreover,
Fig. 8 shows larger N2 in the lateral occipital sites (O1 and O2)
than in the midline sites (Pz and Oz). Similar results were also
obtained for the other subjects (not presented here due to the
page space limit).
Fig. 9 shows the average power density spectra of the EEG
signals across 40 control trials for the two subjects, where the
power spectra of each trial were calculated as in (4) using the first
3.2 s of EEG signals from the eight selected channels in SSVEP

session, P300 session, and SSVEP session, respectively. The TPR is the rate of control events being detected during the control state, whereas the FPR is the rate
of false control events detected during the idle state.

detection. An SSVEP was evoked if the power value at the target
frequency was the maximum in the frequency range of 5–9 Hz,
which contained the frequencies of all flickering buttons. As
seen in Fig. 9, an SSVEP was evoked for each attended button
and for each subject. From Figs. 8 and 9, we can see that when
the subject focused on a target group of buttons, both a P300
potential and SSVEP were elicited simultaneously.
B. Experiment 2: Online Performance Evaluation
In Experiment 2, an online asynchronous experiment was
conducted. There were ten idle states and ten control states
appearing alternatively (the first state was always the idle state).
There was no break between two consecutive states. During
the idle state, the subjects were asked to ignore all buttons.

Each idle state lasted for a random period in the range of 30–
60 s. A high beep tone was then delivered to indicate the end
of the idle state. During the control state, the subjects were
instructed to input a random digit (1, 2, or 3) as indicated on
the monitor. Whenever the SSVEP and P300 were detected, the
system produced online feedback to the subject by highlighting
the detected digit quickly (0.5 s) in red and outputting the
digit in a textbox on the monitor. Additionally, the subjects used
the digit “4” as a backspace button to correct any input errors.
Once an error output appeared in the control state, the subjects
used the backspace to delete it and input the digit again until
a correct output was obtained. If a false positive appeared in
the idle state, the subjects also used the backspace to delete the
output and then continued the idle state until the time of this
idle state was accumulated to the predefined value. The actual

starting and ending time points of each state were recorded by
the system.
For each subject, we calculated the time (RT) that a correct
control command was sent, the number of true positives per
minute (TPR) in the control state, the false positives (FPR) in the
idle state, and the information transfer rate (ITR) to evaluate the
performance of our system. Specifically, the ITR is calculated
as shown as follows [36]:


B = ne log2 Ns + P log2 P + (1 − P )log2
(Ns − 1)
(10)
where ne is the average number of events detected per minute,
Ns is the number of buttons in the GUI (Ns = 4 in this study),
and P is the probability that the target is hit.
The results of this asynchronous experiment are summarized
in Table I. On average, the subjects performed 14.18 correct
positives per minute in the control state, and 0.49 false positives
per minute in the idle state using the proposed hybrid BCI.

Furthermore, the system sent a correct control command in an
average of 4.30 s and achieved an average ITR of 22.11 bits/min.
C. Experiment 3: An Application in Real Wheelchair Control
In this experiment, a real full-size wheelchair (Shoprider Mobility Products, Inc., Carson, CA, USA) was controlled using
our hybrid BCI in an indoor environment. The wheelchair footprint was 0.67 m × 0.09 m, and the speed was set to 0.1 m/s. A
laptop computer was set to display the GUI, translate the signals, and drive the wheelchair. In the GUI (see Section II), the
group of buttons at the top was set as a “go/stop” command and
the other buttons were set as pseudo keys that did not activate
any commands. The subjects sit in the wheelchair to control the
wheelchair. Specifically, they sent out the “go” or “stop” command to move or stop the wheelchair by focusing on the target

button in the GUI. Five healthy subjects (S1, S2, S3, S4, and
S5) with no prior wheelchair experience participated in this experiment, and each subject performed 10 trials. In each trial, the
subjects were required to continuously perform the following
alternating control and idle tasks.
1) Send a “Go” Command: The users focused on the
“go/stop” group of buttons to switch the wheelchair from the
static to the running state. The wheelchair would then start
moving.
2) Maintain the Running State (Idle State): The subjects
were asked to pay no attention to any buttons or the monitor
display, maintaining the wheelchair in the running state on a
straight path for 30s until a high beep tone was delivered.
3) Send a “Stop” Command: The users focused on the
“go/stop” group of buttons to switch the wheelchair from the
running to the static state. The wheelchair would then stop
moving.
4) Maintain the Static State (Idle State): The subjects were
asked to pay no attention to any buttons or the monitor display,
maintaining the wheelchair in the static state for 30 s until a
high beep tone was given.
If the “go/stop” command was incorrectly sent in the idle
state, the subjects needed to correct the state of the wheelchair by
focusing on the target group of buttons again. They would then
continue to maintain the idle state until 30 s was accumulated.
Here, the RT and false activation rate (FAR) were used to
evaluate the performance of the online wheelchair control [37].
Note that the RT indicates the time that a correct command is
sent, and the FAR is the number of false activations per minute
in the idle state. We show the performances of the “go” and
“stop” commands in Table II, where “go” and “stop” commands
were always sent during the static and in-motion conditions,
respectively. For the static condition, the subjects sent a “go”
command with an average RT of 4.21s and an average FAR of
0.48 event/min. For the in-motion condition, the subjects sent a
“stop” command with an average RT of 5.50 s and an average
FAR of 0.52 event/min. For all subjects, the RT of the static
condition was less than that of the in-motion condition (p =
0.0294, Student’s t-test), whereas no significant difference in
FAR was observed between the static and in-motion conditions
(p = 0.7489, Student’s t-test).

IV. DISCUSSION
In asynchronous BCIs, an important task is to distinguish the
control and idle states based on the ongoing EEG signals. When
designing the visual paradigm and the detection algorithm, we
need to improve the accuracy of the control state detection (TPR)
and reduce the false alarm rate (FPR) when the user is in the
idle state. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid P300 and SSVEPbased BCI. Four groups of buttons are displayed on the GUI,
and each group contains a large button at the center and eight
small buttons surrounding the center. All of the buttons in each
group flicker at a fixed frequency. At the same time, all of the
large buttons in all groups flash in a random order. By focusing
on one group of buttons, the P300 potential and SSVEP can
both be elicited simultaneously. In each group of buttons, the
small buttons surrounding the large button are used to increase
the stimulus intensity for eliciting the SSVEP. The system detects the control/idle state by determining whether both P300
and SSVEP occur at the same button. Specifically, the detection
of the control state is performed by judging whether one of two
conditions is satisfied (the Condition 1 is checked first, and the
Condition 2 is checked if the Condition 1 is not satisfied). The
Condition 1 is satisfied if the difference between the recognized
button and other buttons in the P300 and SSVEP detection exceeds a predefined threshold. The Condition 2 is satisfied if the
same button is recognized simultaneously by both P300 and
SSVEP detection during a predefined time period.
To demonstrate the benefit for using both conditions rather
than one or the other, we further analyzed the data collected in
the hybrid session of Experiment 1, which contained 40 control
trials and 40 idle trials. Fig. 10 shows the accuracy rates of the
hybrid BCI calculated with both two conditions, only Condition
1, or only Condition 2. When using both two conditions or only
condition 1, the accuracy rates increased with the threshold at
the beginning, and reached a maximum later. Since Condition
2 was not related to the threshold, the accuracy rates obtained
by this condition were also independent of the threshold. Note
that the detection based on the two conditions was performed by
judging whether one of two conditions was satisfied. Condition 1
was satisfied when the difference between the recognized button
and other buttons in the P300 and SSVEP detection exceeded
a threshold. If the threshold was too large, then Condition 1

dotted black curve represent the hybrid BCI using both two conditions, only condition 1 and only condition 2, respectively. The threshold varies from 1 to 6.

was difficult to be satisfied. In this case, Condition 2 could
work, which was satisfied when the same button was recognized
simultaneously by both P300 and SSVEP detection. Thus, the
two conditions corresponding to two types of criteria combining
SSVEP and P300 were irreplaceable and complementary to each
other, and the hybrid BCI should achieve higher accuracies using
both conditions than using one of the two conditions. This was
demonstrated by the data analysis results in Fig. 10.
We evaluated our hybrid BCI in an online asynchronous
paradigm in Experiment 2. The average TPR, FPR, and ITR
for our hybrid BCI were 14.18 true positives/min, 0.49 false
positives/min, and 22.11 bits/min, respectively. Superior performance was achieved compared to the state-of-the-art results
in [14] and [27]. In fact, the authors of [14] reported a mean ITR
value of 15 bits/min while producing 0.71 false positives/min.
In [27], the online system achieved an ITR of 19.05 bits/min.
The improvement of performance might be resulted from the utilization of both P300 and SSVEP features. Specifically, Fig. 7
shows that the hybrid BCI classification accuracy is superior to
that of the P300 or SSVEP-based BCI, which has verified our
hypothesis. Furthermore, we might have unintentionally developed a paradigm that not only combined P300 and SSVEP but
also elicited a strong N200 (see Fig. 8), which could further enhance the discrimination between the control state and the idle
state and improve the classification accuracy.
To find the EEG channels and time periods which contributed
most to the SVM classification, we computed the average SVM
weights derived from the data collected in the hybrid session
of Experiment 1 as follows. According to the construction of
a P300 feature vector for a trial (see Section II-C), the SVM
weight vector for each subject can be partitioned into 10 subvectors corresponding to the 10 channels, respectively; each
subvector contained the time from 0 to 600 ms. These average subvectors of SVM weights across all the eight subjects
are shown in Fig. 11, in which the vertical and horizontal axes
correspond to the channels and time points, respectively. Larger
weights indicate more contribution to the SVM classification. It
can be seen that the weights of occipital channels O1, Oz, and

subjects derived from the data collected in the hybrid session of Experiment 1.
Larger weights indicate more contribution to the SVM classification.

O2 at around 200 and 400 ms are the largest. This observation
and the ERP waveforms shown in Fig. 8 further suggested that
not only the P300 but also the N200 from the channels O1, Oz,
and O2 contributed most to the SVM classification.
Using our hybrid paradigm, we produced a “go/stop” command in real wheelchair control and evaluated the static and
in-motion performance in terms of RT and FAR. The proposed
hybrid BCI could send a “go” command in an average of 4.12 s
with 0.48/min FAR in the static condition and a “stop” command
in an average of 5.28 s with 0.52/min FAR in the in-motion condition. Here, we make a comparison with a benchmark result
in an existing wheelchair study [32]. In [32], the user could
stop the wheelchair by using a faster P300-based BCI. For the
P300-based BCI, the average RT and FAR in the static condition were 6 s and 1.2/min, whereas the average RT and FAR in
the in-motion condition were 5.9 s and 1.4/min, respectively.
These results indicated that our hybrid system achieved superior
performance in the “go/stop” control of a wheelchair compared
to the P300-based BCI in [32]. Furthermore, the authors in [32]

LI et al.: HYBRID BCI SYSTEM COMBINING P300 AND SSVEP AND ITS APPLICATION TO WHEELCHAIR CONTROL

also proposed another alternative approach to produce “stop”
command using MI-based BCI. The average RT and FAR in
the static condition were 4.9 s and 0/min, whereas the average
RT and FAR in the in-motion condition were 5.5 s and 0/min,
respectively. Since the direction control of the wheelchair was
automatic in [32], the authors could use MI for “stop” command
and obtained satisfactory results. In this study as well as our previous study [23], the direction of a wheelchair was controlled
by MI-related mu/beta rhythm, we thus produced the “stop”
command using the other brain patterns, i.e., P300 and SSVEP.
In our previous study, a hybrid BCI wheelchair that combined
MI and the P300 potential was used for direction and speed
control of a simulated/real wheelchair [23]. Specifically, the
user controlled the direction (left or right turn) of the wheelchair
using left- or right-hand imagery. Furthermore, a hybrid method
was used to control speed. To decelerate, the user imagined foot
movement while ignoring the flashing buttons on the GUI. If the
user wished to accelerate, then he/she paid attention to a specific
flashing button without performing any MI. In this study, we
produced a stop command for the wheelchair using the hybrid
P300 and SSVEP-based paradigm. Our experimental results
show the feasibility and efficacy of the hybrid BCI in wheelchair
control. Based on the GUI presented here, we can incorporate
P300 potential, SSVEP, and MI into our BCI wheelchair. Briefly,
we may use MI for direction control and one group of buttons
in the GUI in this paper for speed control as described in [23].
Furthermore, we may also use another group of buttons for start
and stop control as in this paper.

V. CONCLUSION
In asynchronous BCIs, a key problem is distinguishing the
control and idle states based on ongoing EEG signals. In this
paper, a hybrid asynchronous BCI combining P300 and SSVEP
was presented, in which the control state and target button are determined by both P300 and SSVEP detections. Our experimental
results showed that both P300 and SSVEP can be elicited simultaneously and that the performance for detecting the control/idle
state can be improved using our hybrid BCI. In BCI wheelchair
control, it is an important and difficult task to produce a “stop”
command as accurately and quickly as possible. As an application, we used our hybrid BCI system for the “go/stop” control of
a real wheelchair, and demonstrated our system’s effectiveness
in an online wheelchair control experiment.
