of Things

Abstract—Current challenges demand a profound restructuration of the global healthcare system. A more efficient system is
required to cope with the growing world population and increased
life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of
chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD).
One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time
motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario
by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient’s clothes
and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices
such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge
amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but
also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed
into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening
conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical
deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A
major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing
resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The
patient participates actively in disease management via combined
objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information
within both medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss
the existing wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis on how this technological
platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of diagnostics
and treatment.
Index Terms—Internet of things (IoT), knowledge discovery,
parkinson’s disease (PD), patients, wearable technologies.

economy [1]. In this review, we refer to the term lateralization
as the parallel distribution of tasks and resources while creating
a good or service. An example of this change is the generation
and distribution of energy, which is moving from centralized
power plants based on finite resources, such as fossil fuels, toward laterally distributed self-reliant micropower plants based
on flexible resources, such as solar and wind energies. In this
context, there is no hierarchical distinction between producers
and consumers.
Along with this change, the healthcare paradigm is also shifting toward a new era of diagnostics and individualized treatment. The world’s population continues to increase [2]. Longer
life expectancies and a predominance of elders and disabled
survivors [2]–[7] urge us to develop strategies to reduce healthcare costs. Importantly, an older population translates into an
increased prevalence of chronic age-related disorders such as
Parkinson’s disease (PD). In other words, humans are in need
of a more efficient healthcare platform, which can serve the
demand of larger and older populations at an affordable cost.
A potential solution to this problem may arise from the lateralization of the healthcare structure. Following the analogy
with the energy generation and distribution, we need to complement and extend centralized top-down medical institutions
with mobile and laterally distributed microhealthcare systems
(see Fig. 1). In this context, a top-down structure is required as
doctoral training and specialization demand the oversight and
approval of experienced physicians, whereas individual therapy
requires supervision and execution of the patient diagnostics
and therapy. Complementary, new wearable technologies and
the IoT allow a broad distribution and application of individualized diagnostics and therapy (lateralization). We can envision
this lateralization in two major ways: 1) the development of a
highly efficient laterally distributed platform such as wearable
technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT) and 2) the active
engagement of patients in disease management.
As we learn more about the pathological mechanisms driving
disease progression and develop more individualized treatment
paradigms for distinct disease entities, its management becomes
more complex in nature. Modern molecular technology allows
genetic screening for disease causing or risk-factor genes for
complex disorders. For example, the clinical diagnose of PD has
been linked to numerous genes with different functions and even
more risk loci for PD, underlying the interindividual differences
of disease cause, presentation, and progression within even one
single diagnose of movement disorders [8]. Further, another risk

such as data privacy and ownership, which is already at the core
of ongoing discussion within western societies and shaped by a
broad range of ethical, legal, and sociological considerations.
One can consider PD as a working model of this change of
the global healthcare system. PD is a neurodegenerative disorder
marked by a severe neuronal dysfunction and loss within the substantia nigra [16]. Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying PD remain unclear, research evidence points to genetic
mutations, defected proteins, increased oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction [17], [18]. The cardinal symptoms of
motor impairment in PD are bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability [19]. Further symptoms comprise
freezing, shuffling gait, dystonia, and other nonmotor abnormalities such as cognitive impairments, sleep disorders, and
dementia [19]. Presence, appearance during the disease course,
and level of impairment vary for each symptom across patients
[20]. Thus, the diagnosis of PD remains challenging and requires
the expertise of highly specialized neurologists.
This review discusses the aforementioned aspects with a focus
on PD as a representative disease model of an emerging era
in healthcare. We specifically address the following primary
concepts: 1) the IoT platform in the context of healthcare; 2)
the potential of combining wearable technology with the IoT in
the healthcare scenario; 3) the challenge of transforming data
into knowledge; and 4) the engagement of patients in symptom
assessment, diagnosis, and consecutive treatment options.
II. IOT AND THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

Fig. 1. Model of a mobile and laterally distributed micro healthcare system.
Lateralization of different tasks complements the efforts of caregivers in delivering the most appropriate and efficient healthcare. The concept represents
accessing the hospital’s resources at hand, where patients can retrieve their medical records, monitor their physiological parameters, keep track of medication,
and have access to medical assistance anytime and anywhere. This concept is
expanded in an interconnected grid of patients sharing similar disease symptoms
and experiences, strengthening community bonds.

factor associated with PD includes the role of environmental
pollutants [9].
We are currently able to gather huge amounts of biologically relevant data, which are continuously transforming into
knowledge. In this context, patient- and disease-specific systems
based on artificial intelligence may become more important for
decision support in diagnose and treatment [10], [11]. Remote
assessment of patients using telemedicine technology can reduce logistic costs and increase patient satisfaction [12]. Home
monitoring and treatment may allow the patient to co-assess
symptoms and readily receive treatment optimizing the use of
intense, costly supervision in an outpatient clinic [13]–[15].
This high-tech environment provides the optimum basis for
patient engagement. Their participation is critical to discover
and perform new diagnostic and treatment techniques. Online
digital biobanks containing specific biomarkers and experience
sharing through the Internet may be the key to improve the quality of healthcare. This, in turn, will bring about new challenges

The term IoT refers to the connection of any physical object
to the Internet [21]. The number of objects connected to the
Internet has increased exponentially in recent years. In 2003,
500 million devices where connected to the Internet, and by
2010, this number scaled up to 12.5 billion [22]. It is predicted
that by 2020, the number of devices connected to the Internet
will reach 50 billion [22], and by 2030, the number of sensors
connected to objects and the IoT will be around 100 trillion
[1]. While the explosive growth of the IoT is multifactorial
in nature, improvements in low-cost technology and optimized
wireless protocols and software applications have been the key
contributors to its rapid implementation [23].
A sustainable IoT platform relies mainly on three pillars (see
Fig. 2): renewable energy, connectivity, and the collaborative
commons [1]. The IoT platform depends on renewable energy
to power up the Internet in a sustainable way and at a nearzero marginal cost. Bidirectional connectivity between objects,
devices, and humans allows the efficient flow of information.
Finally, collaboration is the core of the IoT platform with a
lateral distribution of tasks. Peer-to-peer distribution and the
emergence of a new type of consumer, i.e., the prosumers—
consumers that create and share their own products—are shaping the future of the IoT platform [1].
The intrinsic features of a functional healthcare system
(i.e., standardized clinical tests, disease progression monitoring,
treatment decision making, and patient medical records) present
an exceptional opportunity to adopt the IoT platform. Relocating the resources into a laterally distributed infrastructure allows

plans will be generated online to establish a new course of action. As this bidirectional exchange of information and medical
strategies progresses, new data will be generated, amplifying the
database and, therefore, improving the accuracy of its predictive
power.
III. WEARABLE SENSOR TECHNOLOGY MEETS THE IOT

Fig. 2. IoT and the new healthcare system. Wearable lightweight sensors are
placed on the human body to record motion, biopotentials, and environmental
data. This information is fed to the IoT platform to be distributed and processed.
The data are sent back to the person as biofeedback and human–machine interactions using for example unobtrusive displays, vibrotactile and audible cues.
Built-in on-off machine-to-machine interaction can be incorporated in a way
that interconnected sensors exchange information and assist the patient in daily
living challenges associated with the disease, such as fall prevention.

sharing the cost and involving the patient more actively in disease management. This increases spatial–temporal flexibility in
the performance of regular examination and treatment procedures and reduces the burden on continuous supervision. Home
monitoring and digital versions of standardized clinical tests are
just examples of the potential impact of IoT on PD management
and will be discussed later in this review. Although these new
concepts are still in their infancy, the results are very promising,
and new early products such as “Kinesia,” “APDM,” and “The
Parkinson’s KinetiGraph” are reaching the market [24]–[26].
The chronic and progressive nature of PD presenting with
symptoms that oftentimes vary within a day and over the course
of the disease offers an ideal model that can be integrated into
such a platform. Tracking of motion patterns as quantitative
markers for disease progression, adjusted for gender, age, and
other relevant biometrics, will soon be possible in clinical studies as well as in standard patient care. Wearable sensors are being
designed to capture disease traits such as gait patterns, tremor
episodes, activity levels, and freezing of gait (biosignal monitoring, see Fig. 2). These small, inexpensive, and convenient
devices can be hooked up to the Internet via data aggregators
such as mobile phones, where the information is transmitted to
research and medical databases and sent back to the patient via
visual and other sensorial cues (human–machine interaction, see
Fig. 2). In the future, classification of the data based on population studies will typify disease-specific symptoms and their
progression, enabling a targeted treatment option supervised by
medical experts. In this framework, we expect that biofeedback

The last decade has witnessed an accelerated development
of miniaturized, high-performance, and low-power motion sensors and processing units. Research on microelectromechanical
systems for sensing and communication has advanced this technology to allow wearing lightweight sensors units unobtrusively
using regular clothes [27].
There are three major sensor modalities with applications in
medicine: 1) biopotential-specific sensor units, such as electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), and photoplesmography (PPG) sensors;
2) motion sensor units, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes;
and 3) environmental sensor units such as video cameras and
temperature and pressure sensors. Recent efforts aimed to integrate different sensors following a modular architecture such to
enable interchange and flexibility in data gathering [28]. A detailed description of the aforementioned sensor modalities has
been covered by others [29]–[37]. Environmental hazards such
as pollutants and toxins can also be monitored using wearable
sensors technologies [38]. Less-explored biochemical sensors
such as transdermal glucose and ions present in sweat can be
integrated in wearable units [39]–[41]. Monitoring these important biomarkers complements existing biosignal information
and helps establish an integrated assessment of health status.
Perhaps, the next generation of wearable sensor technology
will be boosted by the lateralization of their design, fabrication,
and distribution. Three-dimensional (3-D) printing technology
may play an important role in this concept. This technology has
shown the potential of allowing any person equipped with a 3-D
printer to fabricate their own physical objects [42]. Importantly,
3-D printing technology is also reaching the development of
wearable sensors. Printing electronics has been used to manufacture ultra-low-cost radio frequency identification (RFID)
enabled sensor networks [43]. Further, additive manufacturing
has proven to be useful for creating force sensors [44]. If this
rapid prototyping is combined with a laterally distributed peerto-peer platform like the IoT, we envision the possibility of patients uploading their disease-specific profiles and downloading
their accordingly individualized treatment tools to print them at
home inexpensively.
Apart from enhanced data recording, streaming, and communication capabilities, signal preprocessing (for example, filtering
and detrending) and basic levels of feature extraction and classification/prediction are now possible in node [45]–[48]. Greater
computational power is allowing new sensor nodes to interact
with one another and their immediate environment. This increases their autonomy, reduces redundant human supervision,
and allows an efficient employment of hardware resources.
Note that generally the IoT platform is described as a collection of motionless devices (e.g., fixed appliances at home),

1876

which are interconnected by pathways of information. However,
the emergence of wearable-based technology connected to mobile devices takes the IoT concept a step forward. Given their
mobile and versatile design, wearables are not limited to one
functionality (e.g., sensing the room temperature), but they can
contribute as a platform to different scenarios. Mobile devices
are equipped with different type of sensors and high-power processors. In this framework, sensors connected to mobile devices
gather simultaneously spatial and temporal information regarding the status of the individual and the community, allowing an
additional mapping of society large-scale phenomena [49].
Altogether, we believe that these technological advances point
toward high levels of efficiency in data gathering and transmission, improved data quality, and the potential of collecting and
distributing large amounts of data almost instantaneously for
both online and off-line analysis.
IV. TRANSFORMING DATA INTO KNOWLEDGE
Extracting accurate and unbiased data based on quantitative
measurements is critical for the understanding of any physiological phenomenon. For example, ECG recordings are unbiased data, which need to be converted into information in
the context of cardiovascular physiology (e.g., measures of
electrical conductivity—QRS complex duration) and then into
knowledge (e.g., wide QRS complexes may indicate cardiac
desynchronization).
To meet this goal, smart algorithms must be capable of handling a large amount of (often multidimensional) data and of
using sensor hardware resources efficiently. Recent advances
in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, specially in the developing of deep learning architectures, present
a promising outlook to overcome these challenges [50], [51].
Understanding how PD patients’ gait differs from the healthy
population requires data-to-knowledge translation, which is
highly valuable to the scientific and medical community. In
research, data collected from wearable sensors mounted close
to the patient’s body are used to quantify patients’ gait. This
is generally performed in three stages: 1) gait segmentation
[52]–[55]; 2) gait parameter extraction [56]–[59]; and 3) gait
parameter analysis [60]–[63]. Gait segmentation is the process
by which similar subsequences are segmented from the total
recording length. From these subsequences, spatial–temporal
gait parameters such as stride length, stride time, and stride
variability are computed. Machine learning approaches can be
employed to analyze these parameters and discriminate between
healthy and patients with impaired gait.
Instrumented medical examination seeks to derive knowledge
from unbiased data using wearable sensor technology. Traditional standardized diagnostic tests, such as the timed up and
go test (TUG) and posturography-based examinations, are being complemented by their automated counterparts [64]–[74].
The goal of this research line is to minimize the subjective
character of clinical tests and provide additional information
with an automated and unbiased methodology that can quantify
the degree of motion impairment. The gait analysis approach
described earlier can be applied to complement medical assess-

ment. Another major advantage of combining the IoT platform
with wearable technologies is the possibility of discriminating phenotypes within PD diagnostics (e.g., bradykinesia and
tremor dominant) [75].
Concepts from gait analysis are being extrapolated to unsupervised monitoring of PD as well [76]–[83]. Risk of falling
[81], freezing of gait [84]–[89], physical activity [33], and sleep
disorders [90] are among the most relevant issues to tackle using
home monitoring approaches of motor and nonmotor symptoms
[76]. However, despite the accumulated evidence in favor of
home monitoring of PD patients, there is yet much work to do
in order to create a robust system for unconstrained scenarios.
Major delays in the implementation of home monitoring systems
are caused by the lack of long-term reliability of hardware and
software capable of coping with large interpatient variability.
Likewise, machine-to-machine interaction for knowledge discovery (see Fig. 2) remains largely unexplored in this field. For
example, wearable sensor nodes are currently not prepared to
interact with ambient sensors such as video camera or room
temperature sensors without human supervision. Nevertheless,
this technology, in conjunction with the IoT platform, may enhance the way PD is managed. The automatic recording and
characterization (i.e., quantification) of PD symptoms, jointly
with the fluent interaction of smart objects supported by a smart
Internet grid, could conceivably make it possible to combine
motion, ambient and spatial–temporal patterns to prevent fall
or other adverse conditions in PD, which otherwise would be
impossible to recognize in constrained, static scenarios such as
outpatient clinics.
Beside PD diagnosis and the individualized adjustment of
treatment, invasive interventions and drug administration can
also benefit from employing wearable technologies for data-toknowledge decoding. Deep brain stimulation is a case where
wearable technologies allow to fine-tune and monitor the procedure using quantitative data [91]–[96] as well as the accurate selection of surgery candidates [97]. In addition, wearable
technologies may substantially contribute to the personalization
of medical care. For example, continuous drug administration
(e.g., continuous drug delivery via transdermal patches or subcutaneous pumps [98]) and personalized rehabilitation therapies may be optimized using knowledge derived from wearable
sensor-based data. This is currently the subject of active research
in PD [75], [99]–[101]. Motion sensors attached to the patient’s
body are used to quantify the effectiveness of new medication
and rehabilitation therapies [32], [62], [102].
The process of transforming data into new clinically relevant
knowledge using wearable sensor technology and distributing
through the IoT complements the efforts of caregivers in delivering a more efficient and comprehensive healthcare. Finally,
the patients as essential actors in this interconnected framework
will actively partake in the creation of a complementary lateral
distributed healthcare system.
V. PATIENT-TO-PATIENT INTERACTION
Patient engagement is pacing the shift of the healthcare
paradigm. For PD, this is no exception. Patients with different

PASLUOSTA et al.: EMERGING ERA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PD: WEARABLE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE IoT

illnesses can share their experience on the Internet, reporting on
progression and response to treatment [103]. Effectiveness of
different drugs or other treatment approaches can be discussed
openly. Patients can share their medical records freely on the
Internet for everyone to access the information, upon voluntarily consent. An application-based study using smartphones has
been recently launched [104]. The system has the capability of
tracking symptoms in PD using self-reported data, sensor data
from the phone, and optionally from a wearable device [104].
These data can potentially be used for novel research in prediction, diagnose, and treatment granted that all ethical guidelines
for downstream usage are satisfied.
This new data source brings in controversies regarding selfexperimentation and treatment of chronic disease. For example, self-reported data from patients with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) have been shown to contradict a potential neuroprotective effect of lithium carbonate [105], supported by a
best-evidence clinical study design [106]. Wicks et al. [105],
presented a case where patients voluntarily received lithium
carbonate prescribed by their physicians and they self-reported
their outcomes (using the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale,
which quantifies patient-reported functional impairment) in a
Web-based platform [103]. After applying an algorithm to match
lithium-intake patients to controls based on disease progression
(so called historical controls), no effect could be reproduced in
this open label, observational, noncontrolled study design, consistent with randomized trials performed at a later time. This
study addresses the controversy between best-evidence studies
and small-cohort results on the efficacy of distinct treatments
and the effect of the same drug in everyday practice. Most importantly, this demonstrates the motivation of patients to participate
in their treatment and diagnostic approaches.
This database made up of manual inputs from patients can
be paralleled to the automatic uploading of quantitative data
measured by wearable sensors embedded into the IoT. The result
is a dramatic increase of information that can be extensively
used not only by researchers and physicians but also by the
patients themselves. This represents a completely new challenge
for quality control, study design, and the generation of novel
hypotheses.
There are of course limitations in this type of studies, such
as the unblinded and nonrandomized nature of the data as
well as compromises on self-reported data quality [105]. Even
though this presents major challenges, it might illuminate the
path to the next generation of disease treatment and patient
engagement.
Further, the current technology facilitates enrollment and
compliance, especially in patients with restricted mobility and
low socioeconomic status. Thus, accessibility granted by a
common platform embedded in the IoT becomes an inclusive
strategy that allows patients from diverse backgrounds to participate in research and clinical studies. In this model, the delivery
of high-quality healthcare is sustained by a technology-driven
strengthening of the scientific and medical communities and
vice versa.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE CHALLENGES
We are experiencing a marked change in healthcare delivery to patients. This profound transition is coming along with
the technological revolution of wearables, the IoT, and new
possibilities using machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Treatment of PD and other disorders that progress with similar
clinical presentations are guaranteed to benefit from this efficient and affordable approach. During this revolution, patients
adopt a protagonistic role in the management of their diseases
and in the development of future diagnostic and treatment procedures by sharing data and adopting new technologies as life
companions.
Validation of clinical and scientific findings is an important
task to take on in this new context. The determination of repeatability and reliability of the new assessment tools based on
wearable technologies and the IoT remains challenging. Likewise, the extent to which these new methods of diagnosing and
treating PD will replace or complement existing assessment and
therapeutic tools is wide open to experimentation and debate in
the PD community.
Future technological challenges point toward data management and the use of artificial intelligence and smart machine
learning. Current challenges include the overload, flow, and
handling of information. A consensual criterion for data ownership [107], data privacy [108], [109], and data sharing [110] is
lacking and is a matter of ongoing vivid legal, social, and ethical debates [111]. After all, the adoption of these technologies
depends on its acceptance in society.
Because of the diversity of contexts in which this technology
is applied (e.g., the ethics applied to the use of wearable technology in young populations differs considerably from the one
in the elderly), the ethical discussion cannot not be addressed
with a one-fit-all approach. One possible point of convergence
is that data handling should be regularized depending on their
type, usage, and users. For instance, the authors in [107] proposed three models of data ownership: 1) a pay-per-use model,
where the users of smart objects can be paid by companies wishing to use data generated from these objects connected to the
Internet; 2) a data market model, which would allow users to
trade their personal data with companies; and 3) an open data
model, based on data collected in public areas such as hospitals and smart cities, supporting the access and control of the
general population to their publically captured data (collected
and used only for known purposes). In another approach, the
3-D model for the Ethical Evaluation of Socio-technical Arrangements (MEESTAR) proposed in [111] seeks to develop
strategies to tackle ethical issues related to assisting technologies. In this model, the x-axis contains seven ethical evaluation
criteria, including care, autonomy, safety, justice, privacy, participation, and self-conception. Along the y-axis, four stages
of ethical sensitivity are proposed. Finally, in the z-axis of this
model, three levels of ethical evaluation are included: individual,
organizational, and social.
Beside the ethical debate, designing and creating such intelligent infrastructure will require the involvement of different

1878

actors (e.g., engineers, computer scientists, biochemists, and social scientist) and joint efforts of patients and physicians [112].
This will also require a deeper understanding of data processing
and machine learning and its retrieval back to the patient in a
meaningful and useful way. The layout of such platform is still
an emerging concept. We are still in need of more cooperative
environments in terms of software and hardware sharing and
benchmarking within open access frameworks. Likewise, further progress begs for much stronger collaboration in human
expertise via the creation of multidisciplinary teams for disease
management. Once these challenges are overcome, we will be
really close to a new era in PD management.
