Abstract—Despite patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were
reported of revealing gait disorders and balance problems, there
is still lack of objective quantitative measurement of gait patterns
and balance capability of AD patients. Based on an inertial-sensorbased wearable device, this paper develops gait and balance analyzing algorithms to obtain quantitative measurements and explores
the essential indicators from the measurements for AD diagnosis. The gait analyzing algorithm is composed of stride detection
followed by gait cycle decomposition so that gait parameters are
developed from the decomposed gait details. On the other hand, the
balance is measured by the sway speed in anterior-posterior (AP)
and medial-lateral (ML) directions of the projection path of body’s
center of mass (COM). These devised gait and balance parameters
were explored on twenty-one AD patients and fifty healthy controls (HCs). Special evaluation procedure including single-task and
dual-task walking experiments for observing the cognitive function
and attention is also devised for the comparison of AD and HC
groups. Experimental results show that the wearable instrument
with the designed gait and balance analyzing system is a promising tool for automatically analyzing gait information and balance
ability, serving as assistant indicators for early diagnosis of AD.
Index Terms—Alzheimer’s disease (AD), balance, balance analyzing algorithm, gait, gait analyzing algorithm, inertial sensor.

I. INTRODUCTION
ITH the coming of the aging society, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias are becoming the major diseases of the elderly. For patients with AD and related
dementias, gait disorders, balance problems, cognitive frailty,
and memory impairments will increasingly become more obvious with patients’ condition worsening [1], [2]. Gait disorders and balance problems are common in AD patients, which
can decrease their mobility and increase the risk of falling [2].

These symptoms can cause severe consequences such as fractures, worsened mobility, loss of independence, and increased
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [3].
Recently, clinical reports have generally indicated that gait abnormalities and variability are not only clinical AD syndromes,
but also independent predictors for potential AD diagnosis [4].
A number of studies have also investigated the relationship between gait abnormalities and cognitive function for AD. For
example, Nadkarni et al. [5] compared gait parameters between
40 early AD patients and 34 healthy controls (HCs), and the
participants were asked to walk at their comfortable speed on
a level ground. The findings were that AD patients had slower
velocity, slower cadence, and shorter stride length than HCs.
Muir et al. [6] demanded participants to perform three dualtask walking tests which consist of naming animals, counting
down from 100 by ones, and counting down from 100 by sevens. Both AD patients and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
subjects showed significant differences in lower stride velocity,
longer stride time, and greater stride time variability than HCs.
To record gait information of the elderly as well as AD patients,
many researchers have focused on developing and employing
various instruments for their clinical experiments. To name a
few, Nakamura et al. [7] studied the relationship between falls
and stride length variability in AD, by videotaping ten consecutive walking patterns of the patients. Webster et al. [8] used
the GAITRite walkway system (CIR Systems, Inc., 60 Garlor
Drive Havertown, PA, USA), which is an electronic mat consisting of pressure-activated sensors arranged in grid formation,
to record subjects’ spatial and temporal gait information at their
self-selected slow, preferred, and fast speeds.
Over the past two decades, many clinical balance examines
have been developed for evaluating human balance ability. For
example, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) [1], [2], the Timed
Up and GO Test (TUGT) [1], [2], and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) [9]. Recently, the abovementioned
examines were further used to probe into the relationship between balance ability and cognitive function. Pettersson et al.
[2] utilized the frenchay activities index (FAI), BBS, TUGT,
TUG manual (diffTUGT), Talking While Walking (TWW), and
Tinetti balance tests for the evaluation of the activity level
and motor function of the subjects with no cognition impairment, MCI, AD, and other dementia. The results suggested that
the motor function seems to be affected in very mild AD but
not in MCI subjects and the AD subjects had difficulties in
performing a cognitive task during walking. Alexander et al.

HSU et al.: GAIT AND BALANCE ANALYSIS FOR PATIENTS WITH AD USING AN INERTIAL-SENSOR-BASED WEARABLE INSTRUMENT

[10] used an optoelectronic camera system to compare body
motion and force output at the feet in AD subjects with those in
healthy elderly while they were asked to stand on a force plane.
The literature concluded that AD subjects had poor balance
ability.
Based on the abovementioned literature review, despite that
gait and balance analysis have already commonly adopted in
the diagnosis of AD patients, there is lack of a reliable wearable
device which can be used for measuring the gait and balance
parameters. Traditional methods with camera, footswitches, or
electronic mats are constrained to a laboratory environment.
In this paper, we developed and explored the capability of an
inertial-sensor-based wearable device composed of a triaxial
accelerometer and two gyroscopes. Embedded with the device
are automatic gait and balance analyzing algorithms to analyze
gait patterns and balance ability for AD patients. The automatic
gait analyzing algorithm consists of stride detection followed
by gait cycle decomposition to decompose a gait cycle into
stance and swing periods and acquire several sophisticated gait
parameters. On the other hand, the automatic balance analyzing
algorithm applies the center of mass (COM) analysis to acquire
the sway speed of body in anterior-posterior (AP) and mediallateral (ML) directions. The experiments suggest the high possibility of using solely inertial sensors for AD patient gait and
balance analysis and therefore, a truly wearable device used for
clinics and AD daily evaluation should be further developed.
Based on the descriptions, one of the main contributions of the
paper is the proposal of an inertial-sensor-based wearable device along with automatic gait and balance analyzing algorithms
for AD patients. Intensive evaluations of the device were performed showing its potential as an alternative to other devices
commonly used in clinics for gait and balance analyzing, while
gives much higher portability. Furthermore, this paper also discovers the proposed gait and balance parameters as the assistive
indicators of AD patients.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
the demographics and participant characteristics, neuropsychological assessment, apparatus, and procedures are described in
detail. The automatic gait analyzing algorithm and automatic
balance analyzing algorithm are presented in Sections III and
IV, respectively. The results and discussions are presented in
Section V. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Section VI.

participants. All the statistical tests were performed with SPSS
16.0 software. The significant differences of all the statistical
results between each group were performed by using analysis
of variance (ANOVA) test. A significant difference between
AD and HC is concluded when the p-value < 0.05. Subjects
were excluded from participants in this paper if their body mass
index (BMI) scores > 35, reported pain sufficient to affect their
walking, were unable to walk at least 50 m without assistance,
cannot follow the instructions, had neurological disorders (e.g.,
Parkinson’s disease), history of stroke, history of falls in the past
year, or orthopedic surgery in the past year.
The demographics of the participants for the gait and balance
analysis tests are summarized in Tables I and II, respectively. Informed consent has been obtained from all subjects, complying
with an approved by National Cheng Kung University Hospital’s institutional review board (IRB). Both the AD patients and
the HCs underwent the MMSE and CASI tests to evaluate their
cognitive functions. Both results showed that the AD patients
had significantly lower scores than the HCs did on both tests,
which is consistent with previous clinical findings.
B. Apparatus
The wearable device we have designed for gait and balance measurement was composed of a triaxial accelerometer (ADXL345), a uniaxial gyroscope (LY530ALH), a biaxial gyroscope (LPR530AL), a microcontroller (STM32F103),
and a micro-SD flash memory card. The ADXL345 senses
the acceleration signals of walking and balance motions. The
LY530ALH measures the yaw-rate of the wearable device and
the LPR530AL measures the roll- and pitch-rates of the wearable device. The sensitivity of the ADXL345 was set from −4g

circuit. (b) Back view of the circuit.

2) Balance Analysis: An inertial-sensor-based wearable device is mounted on the participants’ waists as shown in Fig. 2(b).
Then the participants are requested to maintain body balance and
perform eight balance ability tests, which are:
1) side-by-side stand with open eyes;
2) side-by-side stand with close eyes;
3) left foot tandem stand, a stand with the heel of left foot in
front of and touching the toes of the right foot, with open
eyes;
4) left foot tandem stand with eyes closed;
5) right foot tandem stand with open eyes;
6) right foot tandem stand with eyes closed;
7) stand on left foot with open eyes; and
8) stand on right foot with open eyes.
The tests 1, 3, and 5 are based on the SPPB for assessing lower
extremity function [9]. In addition, the literatures indicated that
vision functions proprioceptively as an integral component of
the control system in standing [11]. Hence, the tests 2, 4, and 6
are utilized to evaluate this phenomenon. The tests 7 and 8 are
used due to the assertion that the poor ability of one-leg standing
had a positively correlation with cognitive impairment [12].

to +4g in this study. Furthermore, the STM32F103 is used to
collect the inertial signals measured from the accelerometer and
gyroscopes, and store the data to SD card. The output signals
of the accelerometer and gyroscopes are all sampled at 100 Hz
by a 12-bit analog to digital converter (ADC). The power consumption of the wearable hardware device is 30 mA at 3.7 V.
The size of the board is 45 mm × 32 mm × 8 mm as shown in
Fig. 1. The wearable device satisfies the following fundamental
requirements: lightness and sensing capability.

This section introduces the automatic gait analyzing algorithm which has been developed to automatically acquire gait
information from the acceleration and the angular velocity signals measured by the accelerometer and gyroscopes embedded
in the wearable device. The automatic gait analyzing algorithm
is composed of the following steps.
A. Signal Preprocessing
The signal preprocessing consists of calibration and low-pass
filter. First, the calibration process is used to reduce the drift
errors and offsets from the raw inertial signals. Second, a moving
average filter is used to reduce the high-frequency noise of the
calibrated inertial signals from the inertial sensors. A detailed
signal preprocessing procedure can be found in [13].

C. Procedure of Experiments
1) Gait Analysis: The proposed inertial-sensor-based wearable devices were mounted on participants’ feet as shown in
Fig. 2(a). The participants were demanded to walk along two
straight lines of 40 m on National Cheng Kung University Hospital campus, one for single-task walking and the other for
dual-task walking. The aim of the experimental design is to
investigate differences in the relationship between executive
function and gait variability during single-task and dual-task
walking when more cognitive capacity and attention loading
are required. In single-task walking, the participants were demanded to walk at normal speed. In dual-task walking, they
were asked to also walk at normal speed while simultaneously
count down from 100 to 1. During the walks, all subjects were
accompanied by a researcher to minimize the risk of falls. The
researcher must remain out of the subjects’ sight to avoid the
interferences resulted from his or her presence to the walking
test, causing unnecessary cues for the subjects’ movement.

B. Stride Detection
A stride detection algorithm has been developed to automatically acquire gait information of each gait cycle from the filtered
acceleration and angular velocity signals generated from walking motions during the single-task and dual-task walking. The
proposed stride detection algorithm is composed of the steps
described as follows.
Step 1: Calculation of signal vector magnitude (SVM): Let
SVM represents a measure of the degree of movement intensity
of walking motions in this study. The SVMs of the acceleration and angular velocity signals, respectively, are calculated as
follows:

(1)
SVMacc (k) = a2x (k) + a2y (k) + a2z (k)

SVMgyro (k) = ωx2 (k) + ωy2 (k) + ωz2 (k)
(2)

HSU et al.: GAIT AND BALANCE ANALYSIS FOR PATIENTS WITH AD USING AN INERTIAL-SENSOR-BASED WEARABLE INSTRUMENT

where k is the time step, ax (k), ay (k), and az (k) are the filtered
accelerations of x-, y-, and z-axis of the triaxial accelerometer,
respectively. ωx (k), ωy (k), and ωz (k) are the filtered angular
velocities of x-, y-, and z-axis of the gyroscopes, respectively.
Step 2: Windowing: The SVMs of the acceleration and angular velocity signals are segmented into windows of three sample points (0.03 s) without overlapping, respectively. Then, the
variances of the SVMs of the acceleration and angular velocity
signals in each window can be calculated, respectively.
Step 3: Finding start points of strides: Initially a start flag
Fs is set and the signal is scanned from the starting, window
by window. Once the variances of the SVMs of the acceleration
and angular velocity signals of a window are higher than TH1 =
0.001 and TH2 = 0.1, respectively, this window is considered
one starting window of stride and the first sample point of this
window is determined as the start point of a dynamic interval
within a gait cycle. Once a start point of a stride is detected, the
Fs is reset to allow the following step (Step 4) to find the end
point of the stride.
Step 4: Finding end points of strides: This step is conducted
when Fs is reset. If the variances of the SVMs of the acceleration and angular velocity signals of a window are lower than
TH3 = 0.0005 and TH4 = 0.0005, respectively, this window is
considered one ending window and the first sample point of this
window is determined as the end point of a dynamic interval
within a gait cycle. Once an ending point of a stride is found,
the Fs is set again to allow Step 3 to search the start point of the
subsequent step.
Fig. 3(a) and (b) shows the filtered acceleration and angular velocity signals, respectively. Fig. 3(c) shows the SVMs
obtained from the filtered acceleration and angular velocity signals. The obtained static and dynamic intervals of the gaits are
also illustrated in Fig. 3. Once the static and dynamic intervals
have been determined, we further calculate six gait parameters,
including: 1) number of strides, 2) walking time, 3) mean stride
length, 4) mean stride frequency, 5) mean stride speed, and 6)
mean stride cadence. Definitions of these six parameters can be
found from our earlier work [14].
C. Gait Cycle Decomposition
Once each stride is detected through the abovementioned
stride detection algorithm, we can further detect the points of
toe-off and heel-strike within the dynamic intervals by using
y-axis angular velocity signals of the gyroscope. An approach
to find out the toe-off and heel-strike points by detecting the first
and second local minimums/maximums of the angular velocity
in the gait cycle, proposed by [15], is adopted in this paper.
From Fig. 4, the first and the second local minimums within
each dynamic interval are defined as the toe-off and heel-strike
points, respectively. Once the toe-off and heel-strike points of
each gait cycle can be found, we can obtain the stance and swing
periods within each gait cycle. Then, we can calculate ten gait
parameters to represent the pace, rhythm, and variability factors.
The gait parameters will be described as follows:
1) Stride time: The time interval from the heel strike point
to the next heel strike point.

to the toe off point within each gait cycle.
3) Swing time: The time interval from the toe off point to

the standard deviation of the stride time to the mean as
a percentage, which can indicate the variability of the
stride time.
5) CV of stance time: The ratio of the standard deviation of
the stance time to the mean as a percentage, which can
indicate the variability of the stance time.

gait cycle to the mean as a percentage, which can indicate
the variability in the percentage of the stance period in
the gait cycle.

cycle (CV of swing period): The ratio of the standard
deviation of the percentage of the swing period in the gait
cycle to the mean as a percentage, which can indicate the
variability in the percentage of the swing period in the
gait cycle.
IV. AUTOMATIC BALANCE ANALYZING ALGORITHM
Since the wearable device was mounted on participants’
waists, the accelerations of the triaxial accelerometer embedded
in wearable device can be regarded as the acceleration signals
at the approximate level of the COM [16]. Once we obtain the
filtered acceleration signals through the signal preprocessing
procedure as that used in gait analysis, the average sway speed
rate in AP and ML directions of the projection path of body’s
COM can be calculated as follows.
Step 1: Calculate the SVM of the filtered acceleration signals
generated from the wearable device mounted on participants’
waist at each time step (k).
Step 2: Calculate the directional cosines of the SVM of the
accelerometer signals [16], as shown in Fig. 5
cos α(k) =

ax (k)

cos β(k) =

dx (k) = D(k) cos α(k).

This can also be regarded as the displacement of each time
step in the AP direction.

step (k) from original point in the Y coordinate (dy (k))
dy (k) = D(k) cos β(k).

This can also be regarded as the displacement of each time
step in the ML direction.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Single-Task Walking Test
Table III summarizes the spatiotemporal gait parameters for
each of the AD and HC groups when walking at self-selected
speeds in single-task walking test. The statistical results of gait
parameters showed significant differences (p-value < 0.05) between the AD and HC groups. Obviously, the AD patients take
more stride counts and time than the HCs did to complete the
40 m test. The AD patients presented significantly shorter stride
length, slower stride speed, longer stance time, higher percentage of stance period, lower percentage of swing period, greater
CV of stand period, and greater CV of swing period in comparison with the HCs. The findings in some previous studies
also indicated that the AD patients demonstrated a shorter stride
length and a slower stride speed compared with the HCs when

walking at similar speeds [5], [10], [18]. Another finding in the
single-task walking is that the AD patients spent more time in
the stance phase, higher percentage of stance period, and lower
percentage of swing period within the gait cycle compared with
the HCs in this paper, which could be explained by the inference that AD patients needed more standing time in each
gait cycle to maintain balance. This notable phenomenon presumably indicates that the increased time for standing was the
compensation for the decreased of their balance so as to control
stability between steps [19]. In addition, the CVs of stance and
swing periods of the AD patients were slightly greater than that
of the HCs with both about 3%.
B. Dual-Task Walking Test
Table IV summarizes the results of the AD and HC groups
in dual-task walking test. AD group differed significantly from
the HC group on number of strides, walking time, stride length,
stride speed, stance time, stance period, swing period, CV of

stand period, and CV of swing period under the dual-task condition. Additionally, the stride frequency, stride cadence, stride
time, swing time, CV of stride time, CV of stance time, and
CV of swing time had significant differences between the AD
patients and HCs, whereas this gait profiles showed no significant differences in the single-task walking. It indicated that the
countdown motion is related to the cognitive function and attention [20], so the AD patients performed worse in those gait
parameters than the HCs in dual-task walking. Some previous
literatures also reported that the gait speed, stride length, stride
frequency, and stride regularity revealed significant differences
in a dual-task walking in AD subjects [21], [22]. The findings
in some previous studies indicated that the AD patients demonstrated a longer stride time and a greater CV of stride speed
compared with the HCs when walking at self-selected speeds
[23]. In addition, these findings are consistent with those reported for the influences on gait variability in dual-task walking
in some previous studies [24]. This phenomenon strengthens
the growing evidence of the linkage between gait variability
and cognitive decline. During the dual-task walking, the AD
patients also spent more time in the stance phase, higher percentage of stance period, and lower percentage of swing period
within the gait cycle compared with the HCs for maintaining
their balance. The CVs of stance and swing periods of the AD
patients were greater than those of the HCs with about 7% and
12%, respectively.
C. Comparison of the Gait Parameters during Single-Task
and Dual-Task Walking Tests
The calculated differences between the gait parameters of
the AD and HC groups in the single-task and dual-task walking are shown in Tables V and VI. Both in the AD and HC
groups, performing an additional cognitive task causes a significant difference in all gait parameters. Hence, all gait parameters
presented in this paper are more or less influenced by attention
loading. Obviously, from the results, to perform an additional

cognitive task leads to that the AD patients presented a significantly greater difference of the gait parameters between singletask and dual-task than the HC group. In previous studies, we
found that cognitive loading increase gait variability in AD patients [6], [22]. This phenomenon adds to the growing evidence
of the linkage between gait variability and cognitive decline,
which may help to explain why AD patients fall more frequently
than cognitively normal people among elderly.
D. Balance Test
The parameters extracted from the signal for balance evaluation are the sway speed in AP direction (SAP ) and ML direction
(SM L ), respectively. Tables VII and VIII show the statistical
analysis for SAP and SM L , respectively. As can be seen, for ML
direction, the results of independent samples T test showed a
significant difference between AD and HC in right foot tandem
stand with close eye and stand on right foot activities. Although
the rest parameters did not present a significant difference between AD and HC, it can still be observed that AD patients
presented larger average sway speed in all of the rest parameters. These imply that AD may have poor standing balance than
HCs, especially in one-leg standing and foot tandem stand with
close eyes standing postures. These findings are in line with

previous studies. Rolland et al. [12] indicated that an abnormal
one-leg balance test was a marker of more advanced dementia
and predicts a higher rate of cognitive decline. Chong et al. [11]
pointed out that although AD patients were able to maintain their
balance when standing in normal posture (side-by-side standing) with eyes either open or close, AD patients had a trouble
to maintain balance when standing in incongruent surface with
eyes closed. It is worth to mention that with the inertial sensors
and the analyzing algorithm, the balance abilities of the AD and
HC can be quantitative measured, which cannot be achieved in
the abovementioned studies.

VI. CONCLUSION
AD patients were reported of having different walking patterns. Traditionally, this is conducted using optical or camera sensors. In our study, we attempt to answer the question
whether it is possible to use solely the inertial-sensor-based
wearable device with gait and balance analyzing algorithms for
the evaluation of gait parameters and balance ability of AD patients. Through our experiments, the proposed wearable device
demonstrated its effectiveness as a tool to estimate strides of the
subjects, to measure spatial and temporal gait parameters, and
to assess balance capability. Experimental results indicated that
to perform an additional cognitive task requiring much more
cognitive and attention functions leads to that the AD patients
presented a significantly greater difference of the gait parameters between single-task and dual-task than the HC group. In
the balance ability tests, AD patients also presented a significant
larger average sway speed in ML direction compared with the
HCs during right foot tandem stand with close eye and stand
on right foot. The abovementioned phenomena add to the growing evidence of the linkage between gait variability, balance
ability, and cognitive decline, which may help to explain why
AD patients fall more frequently than cognitively normal people among elderly. The results obtained from this paper suggest
that the inertial-sensor-based wearable device reveals promising
potential for gait and balance capability analysis and is worth
of further in-depth research to identify gait and balance parameters in mild AD patients, so as to be served as indicators for
early diagnosis of AD, and also as predictive clinical factors of
progression towards dementia in this population.
