Physical Activity in Major Depressive Disorder:
Toward Continuous Monitoring of Depressive Mood

Abstract—The objective evaluation of depressive mood is considered to be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of depressive
disorders. Thus, we investigated psychobehavioral correlates, particularly the statistical associations between momentary depressive
mood and behavioral dynamics measured objectively, in patients
with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy subjects. Patients with MDD (n = 14) and healthy subjects (n = 43) wore
a watch-type computer device and rated their momentary symptoms using ecological momentary assessment. Spontaneous physical activity in daily life, referred to as locomotor activity, was
also continuously measured by an activity monitor built into the
device. A multilevel modeling approach was used to model the associations between changes in depressive mood scores and the local
statistics of locomotor activity simultaneously measured. We further examined the cross validity of such associations across groups.
The statistical model established indicated that worsening of the
depressive mood was associated with the increased intermittency
of locomotor activity, as characterized by a lower mean and higher
skewness. The model was cross validated across groups, suggesting that the same psychobehavioral correlates are shared by both
healthy subjects and patients, although the latter had significantly
higher mean levels of depressive mood scores. Our findings suggest the presence of robust as well as common associations between
momentary depressive mood and behavioral dynamics in healthy
individuals and patients with depression, which may lead to the
continuous monitoring of the pathogenic processes (from healthy
states) and pathological states of MDD.

I. INTRODUCTION
AJOR depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric disorder that is characterized by the presence of mood disturbances (either depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure
in daily activities) consistently for more than several weeks [1].
In addition to these mood disturbances, behavioral alterations,
including diminished activity, loss of energy, and psychomotor retardation or agitation, are remarkable cooccurring symptoms [1]. In fact, many epidemiological studies of depressive
disorders that used traditional paper-and-pencil self-report assessments have demonstrated the presence of altered physical
activity levels [2]–[6], as well as their significant associations
with the severity of the diseases [7], [8]. As a more quantitative approach, many studies on MDD have collected continuous
measurements of physical activities in daily life using an activity
monitor, and demonstrated a variety of behavioral alterations,
including lower activity levels during daytime [9]–[12], sleep
disturbances [10], [13], and disruption of the circadian rhythm
[11], [14], [15], as well as their improvement over the course of
clinical treatment [16]. However, these studies mainly focused
only on the alterations of physical activity levels or their rhythmicity, and the complete details of dynamical properties, which
may contain richer information regarding pathological states,
have not been examined.
In this context, recently, we measured the so-called locomotor activity, i.e., the spontaneous physical activity in daily
life, in patients with MDD for >1 week, and reported that patients with depression exhibited more intermittent behavioral
patterns that were characterized by reduced mean activity levels
associated with occasional bursts of locomotor activity compared with healthy subjects [17], [18]. These findings suggest
that the statistical properties of intermittent locomotor dynamics can be important and useful objective markers of MDD,
and there is a novel possibility of continuously monitoring the
pathological states of this disorder based on behavioral dynamics. However, although these studies were successful in providing a biobehavioral marker for MDD based on long-term
(>1 week) locomotor activity data, this is not sufficient for
continuous monitoring because of the lack of temporal resolution and correlation with symptoms (e.g., subjective depressive
mood). To capture rapid changes in pathological states in much
shorter time frames (e.g., daily or within-day scales), which
may provide important information on clinical conditions or the
efficacy of clinical treatments, other types of approaches are
required.

HDRS: Hamilton depression rating scale.

Therefore, in this study, we investigated the temporal associations between depressive mood and behavioral dynamics in
patients with MDD using ecological momentary assessment
(EMA) [19], [20]. We particularly examined the manner in
which within-individual temporal changes in depressive mood
scores covaried with local statistics of the locomotor activity
around the recordings of self-reported symptoms. Furthermore,
we compared such associations across patients with MDD and
healthy subjects. The identification of differences and/or similarities in the psychobehavioral correlates between patients and
healthy subjects is considered important because it may provide
valuable insights into the pathogenic processes of MDD; thus,
leading to the early detection of the disease.
II. METHODS
A. Subjects
The data were acquired from 14 patients with MDD [12
males (M), two females (F); age 34.0 ± 5.7 years; age range
22–42 years] and 43 healthy office workers (43 M, 0 F; 40.7 ±
9.1 years; 23–58 years). The patients with MDD were outpatients of the Teikyo University Mizonokuchi Hospital, Kanagawa, Japan, and their locomotor activity data have been
published elsewhere [17], [18]. The patients who applied for
participation in the study were interviewed, and screened using
the miniinternational neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) [21] by
a well-trained psychiatrist. The inclusion criteria were as follows: a diagnosis of MDD according to the diagnostic and the
statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM)-IV [1]; and age
between 20 and 55 years. The exclusion criteria were: current
substance abuse and other psychiatric diseases; lifetime history
of schizophrenia or personality disorder; or severe physical illness. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS;
range: 0–54, no depression: 0–6, mild depression: 7–17, moderate depression: 18–24, severe depression: 25–54) [22] was also
administered to all the patients [13.3 (mean) ± 2.9 (SD); range
8.8–18.5]. The detailed profiles of the patients are summarized
in Table I.

The healthy subjects were full-time office workers at the University of Tokyo. They were recruited using the stratified random
sampling; we first divided a population into strata (i.e., departments of the university), and, then, took a simple random sample
within each stratum. We confirmed that the subjects did not have
a past or current psychiatric diagnosis by simply asking them to
report whether they have a past or current psychiatric diagnosis
or not with a questionnaire. Fifty-three subjects completed their
recordings for the entire study period, but we excluded ten subjects who rated a beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II; range:
0–63, minimal or no depression: 0–13, mild depression: 14–19,
moderate depression: 20–28, severe depression: 29–63) score of
14 points or more (i.e., clinical cutoff level for depression) [23],
[24]. Thus, 43 subjects were analyzed in this study, and the mean
score on BDI-II in this group was 5.9 ± 4.0 (range 0–13). In
this study, while HDRS was used to monitor pathological states
in patients with MDD, BDI-II was used as healthy subjects’
baseline test due to practical as well as technical reasons.
All participants in this study were given a full explanation of
the purposes and potential risks of the study by well-trained researchers. Subsequently, they signed an institutionally approved
informed consent form. This study was approved by the research
ethics committees of the Teikyo University and the University
of Tokyo.
B. Data Collection
1) Assessment of Self-Reported Symptoms by EMA: We used
an EMA technique [19], [20] to record momentary symptoms
in patients with MDD and healthy subjects. This approach allows us to address subjects’ behaviors, psychological states, and
physiological reactions at multiple time points as the individual
experiences them in daily life. The collection of data in natural
settings can enhance the validity of measurements; thus, avoiding the pitfalls of retrospective recall, which potentially distort
self-reported data collection.
A small watch-type computer (Ruputer, ECOLOG, 42 g;
Seiko Instruments Inc., Tokyo, Japan) was used as an electronic diary (ED) to record self-reported symptoms [25]–[27].
Patients with MDD were requested to record their momentary
symptoms by answering EMA questionnaires over the study
period (37.43 ± 14.82 days; range 18–67 days). EMA questionnaires prompted the patients to record their symptoms via a
beep signal at randomly selected times within ±36 min of the
predefined times (6:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 24:00) during waking
periods. Moreover, healthy subjects were instructed to complete
the questionnaires at randomly selected times within ±24 min
of the predefined times (every 4 h: 8:00, 12:00, 16:00, etc.) during waking periods over seven consecutive days. In addition to
these scheduled times, all participants were also requested to
register the time at which they woke up or went to bed as well
as their momentary symptoms at that time (see Fig. 1). The period of data collection is different between patients with MDD
and healthy subjects. The reason for the longer study period in
MDD group was that EMA monitoring was performed during
their treatment. Also, we used a smaller number of EMA in
MDD group to reduce the burden imposed on their treatment.

DAMS, because they are subscales for calculating depressive
mood. It should also be noted that we confirmed that positive
mood is not a robust and unique factor in depressive mood more
than the presence of negative mood.
2) Assessment of Locomotor Activity: The watch-type device
is also equipped with an activity monitor, which is analogous
in performance to the commercial actigraph (Ambulatory Monitors Inc., Ardsley, NY, USA), used widely in the clinical field
[11], [17], [18], [26]. The sensor for assessing locomotor activity
is a uniaxial piezoelectronic accelerometer capable of detecting
small changes in bodily acceleration (ࣙ 0.01 G/rad/s), which
enables to register even slight movements in daily life. All subjects were instructed to wear this device on the wrist of their
respective nondominant hand throughout the study period, except while bathing, showering, performing rigorous exercises,
or any other activity likely to damage the device. In this study,
zero-crossing counts accumulated for every 1 min were used
as locomotor activity data (see Fig. 1). Locomotor activity data
collected during periods, in which the subjects were not wearing
the device or sleeping, were excluded from the analysis.
Fig. 1. Fluctuations of depressive mood scores and locomotor activity. Filled
circles indicate (a) depressive mood scores (y-axis on the left side) recorded by
EMA over four consecutive days in a healthy office worker and (b) a patient
with MDD. Their locomotor activities simultaneously measured are also shown
(y-axis on the right side). The periods during which they were sleeping or had
taken off the device are shaded in gray.

The EMA questionnaires assessed subjective mood states,
and the intensity of physical symptoms (fatigue, sleepiness,
pain, etc.) using a visual analog scale (0–100 with 5-point intervals). The mood states were rated using the depression and
anxiety mood scale (DAMS) [28], which was developed to measure anxious and depressive moods as separately as possible.
DAMS has been shown to possess adequate construct validity
compared to the profile of mood states (POMS) in 578 young
adults [28]. The correlation between positive mood of DAMS
and vigor-activity scale of POMS was 0.61. The correlation
between depressive mood of DAMS and depression-dejection
scale was 0.67 and that between anxious mood and tensionanxiety scale was 0.65. In addition, the reliability coefficients
(Cronbach’s alpha) for positive, negative, and anxious moods of
DAMS are 0.82−0.89 [28]. The DAMS comprises the following
nine adjectives representing mood states: “vigorous,” “gloomy,”
“concerned,” “happy,” “unpleasant,” “anxious,” “cheerful,” “depressed,” and “worried.” Based on these items, anxious (sum of
“concerned,” “anxious,” and “worried” scores), positive (sum
of “vigorous,” “happy,” and “cheerful” scores), and negative
(sum of “gloomy,” “unpleasant,” and “depressed” scores) moods
were calculated. The depressive mood scores were obtained by
combining the last two mood scores [(300 − positive mood
score) + negative mood score]. These mood scores were
rescaled in the range of 0–100. In this study, we focused on
the depressive mood because depressive symptoms are the most
prominent feature of MDD, and mood changes are considered
as an important sign of the pathogenesis of the disease. In addition, we did not focus on the positive and negative mood of

C. Local Statistics of Locomotor Activity
We focused on the first- and third-order statistical moments
(i.e., mean and skewness) of locomotor activity data because the
combination of these statistics can well characterize the intermittent or bursty nature of the data. Lower or higher mean activity levels could characterize the states related to psychomotor
retardation or agitation, respectively. Positive skewness could
quantify the occasional bursts of locomotor activity. Indeed, in
our previous study [29], we considered a variety of local statistical indices as a candidate for characterizing the increased
intermittency of local locomotor activity, the combination of
lower mean levels and higher positive skewness were shown to
be effective. While the standard deviation (i.e., the second moment) is a standard measure characterizing variability of given
data, it is not appropriate for the case where the data do not obey
a normal distribution; the distribution of locomotor activity has
nonnegative values leading to a positively skewed distribution.
In addition, intermittency or non-Gaussianity in natural phenomena is known to be successfully captured by the higher order
statistics, such as nonzero skewness or larger kurtosis (flatness)
of the probability distribution of the observed data [30], [31],
corresponding to the presence of frequent bursts. Therefore, we
modeled the concurrent associations between depressive mood
and the local statistical properties of locomotor activity by using
the mean and skewness as the statistics that could be robustly
calculated from the limited data points (up to 120). These statistics were calculated first from locomotor activity data with a
length of 60 min centered around each EMA recording. The effects of the data length (size) and the location against the timing
of EMA recording were examined later.
D. Multilevel Modeling
This study produced a hierarchically structured dataset,
in which depressive mood scores were measured repeatedly
from the same subject during the study period, and, thus, the

1350

corresponding local statistics of locomotor activity were also
nested within individuals. Therefore, we adopted a multilevel
modeling approach [32]–[34], which is an extension of traditional regression models and has been recommended for the
analysis of data with a hierarchical structure, including EMA
data [20], [35]. This method can also handle both within- and
between-individual effects together in the same model by incorporating random effects into model coefficients, i.e., allowing
the coefficients to vary across individuals. All multilevel models
were estimated using SAS Proc Mixed (SAS 9.2, SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA) with the full-information maximum likelihood method [32]. A p < 0.05 was considered significant.
1) Descriptive Statistics of Recording Profiles: The mean
level of momentary symptoms was estimated using the following null model. In this model, each momentary symptom is
the dependent variable with no predictor, including within- and
between-individual effects.
Level 1 equation (within-individual level)
Yij = π0i + εij

(1)

Level 2 equation (between-individual level)
π0i = γ00 + ζ0i

(2)

Yij = γ00 + ζ0i + εij

(3)

Combined model

where Yij indicates the dependent variable (depressive mood,
anxious mood, or fatigue) at the jth EMA recording for the ith
subject; π0i is the subject i’s intercept; γ00 is the average intercept (i.e., mean level) across all subjects; the random terms
ζ0i and εij are the between- and within-individual residuals; all
variance components were assumed to follow a normal distribution with zero mean. The random term ζ0i represents betweenindividual effect, indicating that the intercept π0i can vary across
individuals.
To test the group differences in mean levels of momentary
symptoms, we adopted a two-level mixed MANOVA model
[25], [29], which can be modeled by adding a categorical variable representing the type of groups into the right-hand side of
(2). Moreover, we performed the same analysis for the local
statistics of locomotor activity.
2) Statistical Model for Associations Between Depressive
Mood and Locomotor Activity: First, we identified the statistical model that describes the associations between depressive
mood scores and the local statistics of locomotor activity using a
combined dataset from the healthy and MDD groups. We compared all possible multilevel models that consisted of a linear
combination of a subset of both local statistics and their interaction. In addition, we examined both fixed and random effects for
each predictor in each model. The specification of considered
models is as follows:
Level 1 equation (within-individual level)
n
πk i Xijk + εij
(4)
Yij = π0i +
k =1

Level 2 equations (between-individual level)
π0i = γ00 + ζ0i

(5)

πk i = γk 0 + ζk i (k = 1, . . . , n)
Combined model
n
Yij = γ00 +

k =1

γk 0 Xijk + ζ0i +

n
k =1

(6)

ζk i Xijk + εij

(7)
where Xijk is the predictor (local statistics of locomotor activity)
corresponding to the jth EMA recording for the ith subject; n is
the number of predictors; π0i and πk i are the subject i’s intercept
and coefficient (i.e., slope) of the predictor, respectively; γ00
is the average intercept across all subjects; γk 0 is the average
slope across all subjects; the random terms ζ0i and ζk i are the
between-individual residuals; and εij is the within-individual
residual. All variance components were assumed to follow a
normal distribution with zero mean. We used the deviance test
to compare the goodness-of-fit of the models with nested or
inclusive relations, in which all predictors in one model were a
subset of the predictors in another model [32].
After identifying the statistical model that best fitted the data,
we also examined the robustness of this model against the choice
of the data length and temporal location that were used to derive
the local statistics of locomotor activity. Particularly, we varied
the data length from 10 to 120 min with an increment of 10 min
centered around each EMA recording. We also varied the center
location of the data from −30 to 30 min of the EMA recording,
with the data length set at 60 min.
3) Group Differences in Associations Between Depressive
Mood and Locomotor Activity: To examine the differences in
the associations between depressive mood scores and the local
statistics of locomotor activity across the MDD and healthy
groups, we added a categorical variable representing the type of
group into the intercept and slopes [i.e., the right-hand side of
(5) and (6)] of the model identified.
Level 1 equation (within-individual level)
n
πk i Xijk + εij
(8)
Yij = π0i +
k =1

Level 2 equations (between-individual level)
π0i = γ00 + γ01 Zi + ζ0i

(9)

πk i = γk 0 + γk 1 Zi + ζk i (k = 1, . . . , n)

(10)

Combined model

n
γk 0 Xijk
Yij = γ00 + γ01 Zi +
k =1
n
n
+
γk 1 Zi Xijk + ζ0i +
k =1

k =1

ζk i Xijk + εij (11)

where Zi is a categorical variable representing a subject’s group
(i.e., MDD or healthy group).The usage of this model allow
us to examine whether the parameter values differed between
groups and provided the estimates of the model parameters for
each group.
4) Cross Validation of the Statistical Model Across Groups:
As shown below, we did not find any group differences in the
model parameters, with the exception of the intercept. This indicates that the only difference in the associations between groups
was an overall level of depressive mood, which suggests that it
is possible to estimate mood changes around an overall mean
level in one group (e.g., depressive scores in depression group)

using the model derived from the other group (e.g., the model
of healthy group) and vice versa, once the adjustment for the
intercept is properly conducted. The cross validity of the derived
models was particularly examined as follows. We estimated the
depressive mood scores of healthy subjects using the model
with the parameter values for the MDD group provided by the
analysis described above. To estimate the scores, we substituted
the local statistics of locomotor activity of a healthy subject into
the model of the MDD group, in which the local statistics were
evaluated from the data with a length of 60 min centered around
EMA recordings. All random terms in the model were set to zero
because of their definition. In addition, we estimated the depressive mood scores of patients with MDD using the model of the
healthy group. The cross validity was evaluated by examining
the correlation coefficient between estimated and self-reported
depressive mood scores via a two-level mixed MANOVA model
using depressive mood scores as the dependent variable and the
type of score (i.e., estimated or self-reported score) as the predictor [25].
III. RESULTS
A. Recording Profiles
We obtained 1921 [137.2 (mean) ± 63.6 (SD) per person]
EMA recordings from patients with MDD and 1781 recordings
(41.4 ± 5.0) from healthy subjects. If simultaneous locomotor
activity data were not acquired properly because of trouble with
the device, we excluded the data from the analysis. Also, the
periods during which the subjects were sleeping or had taken
off the device due to, e.g., taking a shower/bath were excluded
from the analysis. Finally, we obtained 767 (54.8 ± 23.3) sets
of simultaneous recordings of EMA and locomotor activity data
from patients with MDD and 946 (22.0 ± 4.7) such recordings
from healthy subjects.
Table II summarizes the mean levels of subjective symptoms
and the local statistics of locomotor activity used for the analysis. The mean levels of all symptoms in patients with MDD were
significantly higher than those observed in healthy subjects (p
<0.001). The mean activity levels of patients with MDD were
significantly lower than those of healthy subjects (p <0.001),

whereas the values of skewness were significantly higher in
the patients than in controls (p < 0.001). These differences in
the local statistics of locomotor activity indicate the increased
intermittency of behavior dynamics, which is phenomenologically compatible with our recent findings of alterations of scaleinvariant statistics in patients with MDD derived from long-term
(>7 days) locomotor activity data [17]. This indicates that the
increased intermittency observed in patients can also be captured
by alterations in the local statistics, particularly the combination
of decreased mean activity levels and higher positive values of
skewness.
B. Identification of the Statistical Model for Depressive Mood
The statistical model identified from the combined dataset
from both groups was a linear combination of the local mean,
skewness, and their interaction as predictors, in which the
local mean and intercept had a random effect: Depressive
mood scoresij = γ00 + γ10 (Meanij ) + γ20 (Skewnessij ) +
γ30 (Meanij × Skewnessij ) + ζ0i + ζ1i (Meanij ) + εij . The
coefficients of all the predictors were significant (see Table III),
with a positive value (γ20 = 1.82 ± 0.70, p = 0.009) for skewness and negative values for both the mean (γ10 = −0.03 ±
0.01, p = 0.008) and interaction (γ30 = −0.01 ± 0.01, p =
0.030). These results indicate the presence of a significant
association between the increased intermittency of locomotor
activity and worsening of the self-reported depressive mood.

1352

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. 19, NO. 4, JULY 2015

with a significant positive value (γ20 = 1.79 ± 0.79, p =
0.023) for skewness and negative values for both the mean
(γ10 = −0.05 ± 0.02, p = 0.013) and their interaction (γ30 =
−0.01 ± 0.01, p = 0.079). In contrast, none of the coefficients
estimated in healthy subjects were significant (γ20 = 0.91 ±
1.67, p = 0.587 for skewness; γ10 = −0.03 ± 0.02, p = 0.133
for the mean; and γ30 = −0.01 ± 0.01, p = 0.585 for the interaction), whereas the signs of all coefficients were consistent
with those estimated for the MDD group. The difference in the
significance of the model parameters between groups may have
been caused by the difference in within-individual sample sizes
(on average: 54.8/person for the MDD group and 22.0/person
for the healthy group). However, even these parameters for the
healthy group fit well in the cross-validation study which are
shown below.
D. Cross Validation of the Statistical Model Across Groups

Fig. 2. Dependence of model coefficients on different locations and data
lengths. Coefficient of the predictors: (a) Mean (γ 1 0 ), (c) skewness (γ 2 0 ), and
(e) mean × skewness (γ 3 0 ) of the model identified as a function of the location.
In these panels, the data length was fixed at 60 min. The same is shown in panels
(b), (d), and (f), with the exception of the dependence on the data length. Here,
the center of the data used for the derivation of the statistics was fixed at the
timing of the EMA recording. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean.
The asterisks and daggers indicate that the model coefficients are significantly
different from zero at p < 0.05 and 0.10, respectively.

The negative coefficient of interaction term possibly reflects
situations in which the depressive mood becomes worse with
both lower activity levels and positively larger skewness; thus,
more frequent episodes of bursts are observed.
We demonstrated the robustness of the model identified
against the choices of the data length and temporal location
that were used to calculate the local statistics of locomotor activity. Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the coefficients of three
predictors on the different values of choices. All coefficients
were consistently significant over a broad range of location [see
Fig. 2(a), (c), and (e)] and data length [see Fig. 2(b), (d), and
(f)] values, which was indicative of the robustness of the model
identified.
C. Group Differences in the Associations Between Depressive
Mood and Locomotor Activity
There were no significant differences in the coefficient of
all predictors, with the exception of the model intercept (see
Table III). This indicates that identical relationships between
changes in mood and behavior exist across patients with MDD
and healthy subjects, although the patients had higher levels of
overall depressive mood scores, as represented by the higher
intercept values.
Table III summarizes the estimates of model coefficients
for both groups. All the coefficients in patients with MDD
were significant, with the exception of the interaction term

The correlation between self-reported depressive mood in patients and estimated scores based on the model for the healthy
group was significant (correlation coefficient r = 0.21; p <
0.001). Regarding the depressive mood scores of healthy subjects, the correlation coefficient was also significant (r =
0.10, p < 0.001). These results indicate the cross validity of the
models identified or the presence of shared psychobehavioral
correlates across groups.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this study, we examined psychobehavioral correlates between momentary depressive mood and behavioral dynamics
in patients with MDD. We particularly evaluated the withinindividual associations between changes in momentary selfreported depressive mood scores and the local statistics of locomotor activity simultaneously measured. While most studies
have investigated the between-individual associations between
locomotor activity and subjective symptoms [36], this study
examined the associations on a within-individual basis. In addition, as prior studies suggested [36], [37], these associations
were revealed by multimodal interactive assessment of repeatedly measured momentary depressive mood by ED and objectively obtained locomotor activity. We believe that this ensures
enhanced understating of psychobehavioral correlates in MDD.
The statistical model that described the associations showed
increased intermittency of behavioral dynamics with worsening
of depressive mood. This result suggests that it is possible to
estimate momentary depressive mood from the objective measures of locomotor activity; thus, leading to continuous monitoring of the pathogenic processes and pathological changes
of MDD. Furthermore, we confirmed the cross validity of the
model describing within-individual associations across healthy
subjects and patients with MDD. The existence of shared psychobehavioral correlates between groups implies that changes
in momentary depressive mood in healthy individuals, like those
recorded for clinically depressed patients, can also be estimated
from locomotor activity data. However, we also found the group
difference in the overall level of depressive mood score (i.e.,
the intercept) suggesting that the model for healthy individuals

cannot be simply used to predict depressive mood levels of
the patients. Such discontinuity in psychobehavioral relations
between healthy subjects and the patients might have implications for the pathogenic processes; hence, the prevention and/or
early detection of MDD. Continuous monitoring of psychobehavioral dynamics for the high-risk subjects developing MDD
(e.g., subjects who show a high level of depressive mood) would
be expected to provide more detailed pathogenic processes in
the future research.
The intermittent and bursty nature of human behavioral dynamics is now receiving attention in various scientific fields
[38]–[42]. Recently, we found the increased intermittency of
locomotor activity in patients suffering from MDD [17] and
schizophrenia [43], which was indicative of more frequent
episodes of slowing down or cessation of movement, while having occasional bursts in these patients compared with healthy
subjects [e.g., days 3–4 of Fig. 1(b) compared with Fig. 1(a)].
Furthermore, we proposed a possible theoretical model for intermittent behavioral dynamics and its alterations based on a
priority stochastic queuing theory [44]. According to this model,
the increased intermittency observed in patients with MDD can
be explained by a strategic change in decision making to initiate actions with preferential selectivity to demands (cues) with
higher priority. Patients with MDD tend to react only to higher
demands and/or stimuli (generating occasional activity bursts)
and stay quiet for most of the time (resulting in reduced activity). The results of this study further suggest that such a strategic
change can be associated with alterations in momentary depressive mood, leading to increased local intermittency in locomotor
dynamics.
The advancement of information and communication technologies has led to the recent rigorous development of healthcare monitoring systems that often combine mobile technologies
[45]–[47] and are expected to play a considerable role in early
detection, management, and treatment of psychiatric disorders,
including MDD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia [46], [47].
To successfully establish such systems, many essential elements
have been under study. For example, the concept of ecological
momentary interventions (EMIs), in which real-time interventions are delivered to individuals during their everyday lives in
natural settings, is a core elemental technology that is used for
novel treatments of these diseases [48]. In contrast, the signcontingent EMA, which is an assessment that is triggered by
a warning “sign” related to the disorders, is considered useful for detecting early signs of psychiatric disorders and their
pathological transitions [35], [49]. However, the development of
objective, reliable, and, more importantly, real-time biobehavioral markers for psychiatric disorders is necessary to establish
these important elements; thus, the demand for such markers
has grown recently. In this context, this study has a great potential to contribute to the establishment of healthcare systems
by providing an objective and real-time biobehavioral marker,
i.e., a statistical model for depressive mood based on behavioral
dynamics. In addition, our findings serve as useful models for
continuous monitoring and estimation of depressive mood, as
well as fundamental techniques for the realization of EMIs and
sign-contingent EMA.

Fig. 3. Estimation of depressive mood scores using personalized models.
Open squares indicate the estimates of depressive mood scores (y-axis on the
left side) by substituting the local statistics of locomotor activity (within 60 min
centered around the EMA recording) into the statistical model with personalized parameter values. The personalized parameter values for subject no. 12
(upper) were: γ0 0 = 83.78, γ1 0 = −0.08, γ2 0 = 1.17, and γ3 0 = −0.01,
whereas those for subject no. 6 (lower) were: γ0 0 = 70.38, γ1 0 = −0.15,
γ2 0 = 4.08, and γ3 0 = −0.06. The correlation coefficients r and their p values
between the estimated and self-reported scores were 0.80 and 0.74, respectively. Note that the estimation of depressive mood was only made for periods
in which the subjects were awake and wearing the device (a) Patient No. 12
(b) Patient No. 6.

One potential limitation of this study was that the correlation
coefficients obtained in the cross validation of the identified
model were small, although the correlations themselves were
significant. These low correlation values may be because of wide
individual differences, such as lifestyle, pathological conditions,
and effects of antidepressant medication. However, these individual effects may be minimized by optimization methods, such
as support vector machine [50] or neural network approaches
[51]. For example, the personalization of the model structure
and its parameters using the data of the first few weeks could
minimize the individual effects and improve the ability to estimate depressive mood scores. In fact, we could improve the
estimation of the depressive mood scores merely by personalizing the model parameters using simple linear models employed in this study. Fig. 3 shows typical cases in which the
estimation was highly improved by this type of personalization.
The parameters of the model derived in this study were optimized individually using data collected at one week in the early
part of the measurement. Subsequently, the depressive scores
in another week in the later part of this study were estimated
using personalized parameters. In these patients, the correlation coefficients between self-reported and estimated depressive
mood scores were considerably higher [r = 0.80 (p = 0.002)
for Fig. 3(a) and r = 0.74 (p = 0.004) for Fig. 3(b)] than those
calculated for the overall cross validation. Although we were unable to perform this optimization procedure for the data from all

1354

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. 19, NO. 4, JULY 2015

patients because this requires relatively long-term measurements (>2 weeks), we confirmed considerable improvements
in the estimation in six patients who had this condition with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.48 to 0.80. Other sophisticated optimization methods would probably highly improve the
estimation.
In addition, the inconsistency of the EMA protocols between
patients with MDD and healthy subjects could be a limitation
of this study. Also, diagnostic interviews such as MINI have not
been performed for healthy subjects in this study. Therefore,
careful consideration is needed when we consider group differences on the findings. Furthermore, there can be a systematic
bias that the data just before/after sleeping or taking a shower
can be easily excluded from the analysis; this should be considered when we interpret the findings. The other weaknesses
of this study included the effects of medications on behavioral
dynamics and the small sample size. Thus, the generalization of
our findings will require a large population study using drug-free
patients. Another issue that should be addressed is the ceiling
effect. Although patients with MDD showed a level of variability in depressive mood scores that was comparable with that of
healthy subjects, four patients occasionally reported maximum
scores during the study period. Because of the low rate (2.76%)
of such data points, we believe that the ceiling effect was limited
in our study; however, there is a possibility that the associations
observed were slightly distorted by such an effect.
V. CONCLUSION
We demonstrated the presence of associations between momentary depressive mood and behavior dynamics, and showed
their cross validity across patients with MDD and healthy subjects. The results suggest that it may be possible to objectively
estimate a momentary depressive mood based on pattern of
physical activity; thus, leading to continuous monitoring of the
pathogenic processes and pathological states of MDD.
