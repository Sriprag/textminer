Abstract—Goals: To investigate if the stair negotiation by older
people during activities of daily life (ADL) can be accurately
identified using a freely worn pendant device. To investigate how
usual stair-ascent performances during ADL relate to clinical
assessments and prospective falls. Methods: ADL were recorded
for 30 min by 52 community-dwelling older people (83 ± 4 years)
using a small pendant device. Classification accuracy was assessed
using annotated video and four-fold cross validation. Correlations
between sensor-derived stair-ascent features (comprising intensity,
variability, and stability) and a battery of clinical tests (comprising
physiological, psychological, health, and follow-up falls) were investigated. Results: Accurate identification of stair events (99.8%,
Kappa 0.92) was possible in both “frail” and “athletic” participants
by scaling the barometer threshold to stair cadences. Cautious
double-stepping strategy could be identified remotely. Stair-ascent
performance was correlated with ascent strategy (r = −0.67), age
(r = −0.44), concern about falling (r = −0.43), fall-risk scores
(r = −0.41), processing speed (r = −0.38), and contrast sensitivity (r = 0.32). Follow-up falls were correlated with ascent stability (r = −0.35). Conclusion: Remote analysis of stair ascents
is feasible. In our healthy older people, outcomes appeared more
related to mental rather than physiological factors. The ascent
strategies we observed in some older people may have reflected
an appropriate behavioral response to increased concerns about
falling. Significance: Given acceptance of wearable devices is
increasing; reduced functional performance and altered strategies
for undertaking ADL could soon be routinely tracked to augment
health care.

Inability to undertake this task is a strong predictor of nursing
home admission [2]. Older people are more likely to trip over
obstacles and show greater behavioral adaptions to stairs [3],
[4]. Trips on stairs are compounded by greater fall height and
account for over 10% of fatal fall accidents [5].
In laboratory settings, reduced stair performances are
associated with motor impairment, pain, fear of falling, poor
vision, and reduced strength [1], [2], [6]–[12]. However, little
is known about how stair performances measured during laboratory sessions correspond to assessments during activities of
daily living (ADL) [13].
For example; compared with level walking assessed in a laboratory, older people walk with significantly lower cadences,
reduced intensity, and greater variability during ADL [14]. Assessments during ADL may provide new insights into usual
stair-ascent performance and how behavioral strategies used to
negotiate stairs (handrail use, double stepping, or avoidance) are
influenced by increased age, fear, frailty, and fall-risk in older
people.
Recent advances in wearable devices have made remote monitoring of many daily activities possible [15]–[22], but accuracy
may be sensitive to precise placement [23]. Wearable devices
have been used to identify stair ascents and descents in younger
people and/or tightly controlled environments [24]–[26]. However, accurate stair event classification in frail older people during ADL remains a challenge [27]. Activity recognition algorithms often rely on barometric measurement of height change,
which contains noise [28].
Furthermore, in ADL, frail people may use the handrail, double step (both feet touch each step), or rest on the landing when
climbing stairs. Ascents may, therefore, be too slow to register
[29], which may be problematic for algorithms developed in
tightly controlled settings.
This paper presents new methods of identifying and characterizing stair-ascent performances during ADL in older people
using a freely worn pendant sensor. Our aims were to: 1) determine device thresholds that best discriminate stair negotiation
from walking; 2) determine the accuracy of the developed algorithms in detecting stair negotiation during ADL; and 3) investigate how stair-ascent performances during ADL are associated
with clinical assessments and prospectively measured falls.
II. METHODS
Fifty-two community-dwelling older adults (83 ± 4 years, see

where they were asked to perform a number of activities (including stair climbing) that they might complete in their home
environment [13], [29]. Participants wore a small pendant device
during the experiment which recorded data from a triaxial accelerometer and barometer, while a video camera recorded their
movements to validate the accuracy of the activity classifications
derived from the sensors. Participants also underwent a battery
of physiological, psychological, and health-related measures.
Falls were recorded prospectively over the following 12 months.
A. Free-Living Stair Climbing Protocol
The free-living experiment was performed at Neuroscience
Research Australia, Sydney, Australia, in a semi-controlled environment, in which participants had to navigate through corridors frequented by other members of the facility. Participants
were free to decline any activity and were unaware of special
emphasis on stair negotiation. During one of the walking bouts,
participants ascended a 3.35 m staircase with 19 steps with a
landing after nine steps (see Fig. 1, panel A). Afterwards, they
continued walking to another room, carried out various other
postural transitions, which included a rest period, and then descended the same staircase. The protocol included negotiating
six steps that connected two wings of the building that were
not annotated as stairs, because they were not considered to be
long enough to complete a meaningful analysis of stair-ascent
variability or stair-ascent stability.
B. Pendant Device
The senior mobility monitor (SMM) research prototype
(Philips Research Europe, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) is a
small pendant (39.5 × 12 × 63.5 mm) containing a triaxial accelerometer and a barometer. The accelerometer sampling fre-

Demographics of age, height, weight, and gender were
recorded. Physiological performance was assessed using the
physiological profile assessment (PPA) [31]. The PPA is a battery of five sensorimotor tests comprising: 1) visual contrast
sensitivity, using the Melbourne Edge Test (MET); 2) proprioception; 3) quadriceps strength while seated; 4) hand reaction
time, using a button press in response to a light stimulus; and 5)
postural sway on foam with eyes open. Weighted contributions
were then used to calculate a physiological fall-risk score [31],
which has demonstrated ability to identify older people who fall
(higher scores indicate greater fall-risk).
Health was assessed by documenting the number comorbidities (0–9) from nine domains [32] comprising: cardiovascular,
respiratory, musculoskeletal, endocrine, urogenital, cancer, neurological, mental health, and eye diseases. Falls over the following 12 months were monitored using self-reported falls calendars and monthly phone calls. Psychological health was assessed
using the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9); a nine-item
questionnaire for screening of depression in which a higher score
(range 0–14) indicates more depressive symptoms [33]. Concern
about falling during ADL was assessed using the falls efficacy
scale international (FES-I). A higher score (16–64) indicates
more concern about falling [34]. Anxiety was assessed using
the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire [35].
D. Wavelet Decision Tree Classification of Stair Negotiation
Similar to previous gait analysis over level ground [14], corrections were applied to compensate for changes in device orientation. Discrete wavelet decomposition used a Daubechies
“db5” wavelet. Heel-strikes were identified by peaks in detail
levels 4 and 5 of the global vertical acceleration (see Fig. 1)
greater than 0.5 m·s−2 , during stable orientation.
In the new methods described here, stair negotiation is further separated from flat walking by pressure changes that are
negatively correlated to height. We use an adaptive threshold
for rate of pressure change (scaled to the stair cadence) in order to accommodate both “athletic” people with greater movement intensity [see Fig. 1(b)] and “frail” people or people who
may present more cautious behavior on stairs [see Fig. 1(d)].
Algorithm training is described in the next section; the final
decision tree thresholds are described below:
1) Periods of stable device orientation were found when the
low frequency content (details 6 and 7) of the acceleration was below a 2.2 m·s−2 threshold developed for level
walking [14].
2) Heel-strikes were identified by peaks in details 4 and 5
(ࣈ2 Hz and 1 Hz pseudofrequencies) using a 0.5 m·s−2
threshold developed for level walking [14].
3) Stair cadence was calculated using ten steps moving average window. To exclude counting multiple steps on each
stair peaks greater than twice the heel-strike threshold
were used. Based on previous work [29] in older people,
the minimum stair cadence for threshold scaling was fixed
at 50 stairs/min.

participant with one heel strike (circle) per oscillation. Dashed line shows the rate of pressure change in cm·s−1 which is negatively correlated to height change.
C—Acceleration peaks for a frail participant who presents reduced amplitude and more irregular peaks. D—Vertical oscillations for the frail participant with two
heel strikes per oscillation indicating a double-stepping ascent strategy. Dashed line show a reduced rate of ascent for the frail.

4) The threshold rate of pressure change for stair negotiation (±3 Pa·s−1 ) was scaled by multiplying by the stair
cadence (calculated in point 3), and then dividing by the
expected median cadence over flat ground (100 stairs/min)
[14]. The scaled thresholds for stair climbing ranged from
±1.5 Pa.s−1 or approximately 12.5 cm·s−1 for the “frail”
[see Fig. 1(d)] to ±3 Pa.s−1 or 25 cm·s−1 for the “athletic”
[see Fig. 1(b)]. Scaling was used because the group was
heterogeneous with both fast and slow stair climbers [see
Fig. 1]. Once the scaled pressure threshold was exceeded,
stair boundaries were defined by crossings at one quarter
the scaled threshold.
5) Partial stair events comprising a height change and
walking (three or more consecutive heel-strikes) were
identified.
6) To accommodate the stair landing and/or pauses by frail
people, partial stair events were joined if any gaps associated with traversing the landing were shorter than 6 s.
7) Stair events were kept if the total step count exceeded 17.

75% of the data, and performance calculated with the remaining
25% “hold-out” data. Training and validation were repeated four
times and, therefore, all 48 participants were used once in one
of the hold-out groups. Results from the four hold-out groups
were combined and the median and range are reported.
During training, grid searches were used to determine the
number of steps (5–20 steps), the rate of pressure change (1–5
Pa·s−1 ), and the duration to traverse the landing (0–10 s) that best
classified stairs (see Fig. 2). Thresholds for ascents were made
identical to thresholds for descents, except the barometer threshold was inverted. Agreement between stair events detected by
the algorithm and stair events annotated in the video recordings
was calculated using Cohen’s Kappa [36], which accounts for
the bias caused by stair negotiation, comprising only a fraction
of the total test duration.
We also calculated accuracy, defined as the percentage of all
activities (stairs or not stairs) correctly classified, false-positive
errors (percentage of not stairs, incorrectly identified as stairs),
and sensitivity (percentage of stairs correct).
F. Assessment of Functional Stair-Ascent Performance

E. Grid Search and Four-Fold Cross Validation
Participants were randomly split into four groups and fourfold cross validation conducted. For each fold, thresholds for
nodes 4, 6, and 7 of the decision tree above were trained in

Bonafide stair-ascent periods (including any pauses and steps
taken to traverse the landing) were initially reprocessed with
the heel-strike peak-acceleration threshold halved to 0.25 m·s−2
to ensure any shuffling steps by frailer participants were not

the video). Because significant (p = 0.001) differences were
observed, a ranked coding based on increasing median stair duration was used: 1 = No handrail; 2 = touch handrail; 3 = grab
handrail; 4 = double steps (both feet on each step).
H. Statistical Analysis

missed. Only peaks at least 333 m·s apart were counted (allowing for a maximum possible cadence of 180 steps/min) to
prevent double-counting noise. Vertical oscillations during stair
climbing [see Fig. 1(b) and (d)] were calculated by double integration of the vertical acceleration and high-pass filtering [37]
with a cut-off frequency scaled by stair cadence.
Stair-ascent performance was assessed using features derived
exclusively from the wearable device data: 1) Stair-ascent intensity, measured using vertical ascent velocity (the barometric
height change divided by the sensor-derived ascent duration),
mean cadence (the number of heel strikes divided by the sensorderived ascent duration), and acceleration-peak mean (the mean
of heel-strike peak height in the details 4 and 5 vertical acceleration). Greater intensity indicates more vigorous movements.
2) Stair-ascent variability, measured using step-time variability
(the standard deviation of step durations) and acceleration-peak
SD (the standard deviation of heel-strike peak heights in the details 4 and 5 vertical acceleration). In line with variability measured in level walking [38], lower variability was assumed to
reflect reduced risk of falling. 3) Stair-ascent stability, measured
by anteroposterior (AP) and vertical (VT) harmonic ratios [39].

Conservative nonparametric statistics were used to compensate for the small sample size and skewed distributions.
Participant characteristics were described with medians and
interquartile ranges (IQR). Associations between factors were
investigated using Spearman’s rank correlations (see Table III),
which is also suitable for use with ranked categorical scales.
Post-hoc medians and IQR for subgroups with different stairascent strategies were investigated using the Kruskal–Wallis
nonparameter analysis of variance. Significance was set at a
p-value ࣘ 0.05 for all tests.
III. RESULTS
A. Participants
The median age was 82 (see Table I). In the year preceding
testing, 11 people (21%) reported at least one fall and three
people (6%) at least two falls. In the twelve month follow-up
period, 43 falls were recorded; 22 people (42%) recorded at
least one fall and nine people (17%) at least two falls.
B. Classification Performance
Using a four-fold grid search optimization (see Fig. 2), medians and ranges of thresholds for the decision tree were: Minimum steps 17 (15–17); barometer threshold 3 Pa.s−1 (2.75–
3.0 Pa.s−1 ); and landing pauses of shorter than 6 s (5–6 s).
In the hold-out data, performance medians and ranges were:
Kappa 0.92 (0.90–0.94); accuracy 99.8% (99.6–99.8%); sensitivity 94.7% (89.3–95.4%); and false-positive errors of 0.10%
(0.07–0.32%).

remaining 48 participants; median ascent velocity was
18.1 cm/s, median stair cadence was 80 steps/min, and step-time
variability was 0.11 s (see Table II). With respect to behavior,
seven participants did not use the rail, six touched the rail, 31
grabbed the rail, and four were double steppers.
D. Correlations With Clinical Assessments
Functional stair-ascent performances across all domains (intensity, variability, and stability) were significantly correlated
with age, concern about falling, processing speed, and ascent
strategy (see Table III). Participants who ascended the stairs with
reduced intensity, greater variability, and decreased stability
used a more defensive ascent strategy (r = −0.67), where older
(r = −0.44) had greater concern about falling (r = −0.43), and
had slower hand-reaction times (r = −0.38).
For our participants, height was an advantage. Increased
height was correlated with reduced step-time variability (r =
−0.35), increased stair-ascent velocity (r = 0.32), and increased stability (r = 0.31). Increased ascent performances
were also correlated to increased contrast sensitivity (r = 0.32)
and decrease fall-risk scores (r = −0.41).
Falls in the follow-up period was significantly correlated with
reduced stair-ascent stability (r = −0.35). Health with respect
to number of comorbidities, and falls history was not significantly correlated to stair-climbing performance. Ascent strategy was significantly correlated with slower hand-reaction times
(r = 0.43), increased concern about falling (r = 0.37), and increased age (r = 0.33), but not measures of health, falls, physiological capacity or frailty.
E. Subgroup Analysis: Falls, Avoidance, and Double Stepping
The four people who avoided stairs had significantly higher
concern about falling (FES-I median 27.5, IQR 4.5) but similar
fall-risk scores (median 0.29, IQR 1.42), and all suffered adverse
outcomes in the follow-up year; one died, and the other three
recorded a total of five falls. Conversely, the four people who
were double steppers (both feet on each step), all recorded no
falls over the follow-up period, but had significantly higher
fall-risk scores (median 1.52, IQR 0.51) and lower contrast
sensitivity (MET median 18.5, IQR 5).

Building on previous study using fixed sensors [23]–[26],
we found stairs between floors could be identified using a pendant device. Classification performance was insensitive to small
changes in step count or pressure thresholds (see Fig. 2). Sensitivity (left panel) dropped when the step threshold exceeded 20,
because the staircase contained 19 steps. False-positive errors
(middle panel) increased when the step threshold dropped below
eight steps or the pressure threshold dropped below 2 Pa.s−1 ,
possibly because of the barometer noise [28]; when participants entered different areas of the climate-controlled building,
walked quickly towards the end of a corridor (possibly causing pressure build-up) or vigorously down an inclining corridor.
Higher step thresholds (ࣙ17 steps) prevented such noise affecting classification performance.
The range of classification accuracy of the pendant device
(99.6–99.8%) during ADL in our sample of 48 older people
agrees with the best cases reported in more controlled settings
and for younger people: 98% for a shoe device in nine adults
[24]; 98% for body-mounted devices in 20 adults [25]; and 99%
for a foot mounted device in four adults [26].
Improving on previous study using a smartphone during
ADL [29]; no cautious stair negotiations by “frail” people were
missed, and no vigorous movements by “athletic” people were
mistaken for stairs. Instead, errors related to defining the exact
beginning or end of each stair negotiation. Scaling the fixed
barometer threshold by stair cadences gave the decision tree
algorithm greater adaptability to identify both fast and slow stair
negotiation by both “athletic” and “frail” people (see Fig. 1).
B. Comparisons With Previous Stair Negotiation Studies
In agreement with the previous studies [1], [4], [6]–[13],
we found stair-ascent performances were correlated with multiple health, physiological and psychological factors. In previous
clinical studies, stair performance has been measured by time
taken [1], [6]–[8], gait kinematics [4], [9], [10], [19], [20], and
extrapolated center of mass [12]. Wearable devices attached to
the lower-back and ankles have also been used to quantify stair
performance using dominant frequency, dominant-peak width,
and signal variance [13]. Previously stair performance has been
correlated with age [1], [6], [10], [11], [13], leg strength [1],
[6]–[8], fear [1], [11], visual acuity [1], [9], ambient lighting
[10], [11], and postural sway [13].
Similar to previously reported r-values up to −0.45 for age
[13] and −0.33 for leg strength [1], we observed mostly weak
univariate relationships. Previously, multiple regression models
[1], [6] have revealed stronger relationships (with r2 values up
to 0.50), which suggests performance decline in older people
may be a complex multifactorial problem [40].
C. Advantage of the Free-Living Protocol
Different from the previous stair negotiation studies [1], [4],
[6]–[12], our free-living experiment enabled measurement of
usual, rather than optimum performance [14]. Since stairs were
only a part of the protocol, performances may have been less
affected by motivation to perform well in a laboratory “test
situation,” and more related to usual daily-life performances.

In contrast to most previous studies, measuring optimum stair
performance, we found no significant correlation between leg
strength and usual stair performance. Apart from contrast sensitivity, no other univariate measures of physiological capacity,
depression, anxiety, falls history, or health had a significant correlation with usual stair-ascent performance. In our group of relatively healthy older people, we found usual stair-ascent performance during ADL was most associated (r = −0.67) with ascent strategy. Furthermore, both ascent strategy and usual ascent
performances had a greater number of significant correlations
with mental factors, concern about falling, processing speed, and
age, than any correlations with frailty, health, or leg strength.
By analyzing vertical oscillations [37], it was possible to identify the more cautious double-stepping strategy used by four
participants. During normal stair-ascent, we observed a one-toone relationship between stepping and vertical oscillations [see
Fig 1(b)], but for double steppers a two-to-one relationship was
observed [see Fig. 1(d)]. Interestingly, participants who chose to
ascend the stairs using a careful double-stepping strategy (possibly appropriate response to their reduced contrast sensitivity)
recorded no follow-up falls, despite their increased physiological fall-risk scores. In contrast, participants who avoided the
stairs had significantly higher concern about falling, but not
higher physiological fall-risk scores, and all had poor 12-month
health outcomes.
For most of our relatively healthy older people the stair-ascent
strategies (ranked by ascent duration) may partly reflect an appropriate and protective behavioral response to slower cognitive

processing speeds and increased concerns about falling. Conversely, our observations suggest complete avoidance of stairs
during ADL may be associated with poor longer term health
outcomes in some people.
D. Limitations
We acknowledge certain limitations. Not all observations may
be generalizable for all people. Sample characteristics need to
be considered, when interpreting the results (see Table I). Participants were mostly “fit octogenarian survivors.” Median age
was 82 years and 42 out of 52 were over 80. Participants were
70+ years, when they initially took part in the Sydney Memory
and Ageing Study, and had survived to the fourth study wave.
Furthermore, the participants volunteered for a 30 min freeliving experiment, which implicitly may have excluded people
with mobility impairments. Fall-risk scores (median 0.85, IQR
1.07) were marginally better than expected for the age-range of
the group [31].
Analysis revealed that both ascent strategy and participant
height were confounding factors that affected pendant derived
measures of functional stair-ascent performance, which may
need consideration in future analyses of remote activity data.
Subgroup observations related to cautious double-stepping and
avoidance need to be confirmed using larger data sets. Future
research should also investigate stair descents, hill climbing,
transfer movements, other ADL, and adherence to the pendant
device during long-term monitoring of larger populations.

BRODIE et al.: NEW METHODS TO MONITOR STAIR ASCENTS USING A WEARABLE PENDANT DEVICE

V. CONCLUSION
Using a freely worn pendant device, stair events were identified with sufficient accuracy to make long-term remote monitoring during ADL feasible. Scaling the barometer threshold
by stair cadence made the decision tree robust to barometer
noise and various stair-ascent strategies by both frail and athletic people. Complementary to over-ground walking, remote
monitoring of ADL provides insights into usual rather than optimal performance and to the extent that age, fear, frailty, and
behavior may interact influencing falls and healthy aging. As
acceptance of wearable devices is increasing, it is likely that
reduced functional performances and altered strategies for undertaking ADL may soon be routinely tracked to augment health
care of older people.
