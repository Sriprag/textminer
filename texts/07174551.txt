Comparative Analysis of Different Methods of
Modeling the Thermal Effect of Circulating Blood
Flow During RF Cardiac Ablation
A. González-Suárez∗ and E. Berjano

Abstract—Our aim was to compare the different methods of
modeling the effect of circulating blood flow on the thermal lesion
dimensions created by radio frequency (RF) cardiac ablation and
on the maximum blood temperature. Computational models were
built to study the temperature distributions and lesion dimensions
created by a nonirrigated electrode by two RF energy delivery protocols (constant voltage and constant temperature) under high and
low blood flow conditions. Four methods of modeling the effect of
circulating blood flow on lesion dimensions and temperature distribution were compared. Three of them considered convective coefficients at the electrode–blood and tissue–blood interfaces to model
blood flow: 1) without including blood as a part of the domain;
2) constant electrical conductivity of blood; and 3) temperaturedependent electrical conductivity of blood (+2%/°C). Method 4)
included blood motion and was considered to be a reference method
for comparison purposes. Only Method 4 provided a realistic blood
temperature distribution. The other three methods predicted lesion
depth values similar to those of the reference method (differences
smaller than 1 mm), regardless of ablation mode and blood flow
conditions. Considering the aspects of lesion size and maximum
temperature reached in blood and tissue, Method 2 seems to be
the most suitable alternative to Method 4 in order to reduce the
computational complexity. Our findings could have an important
implication in future studies of RF cardiac ablation, in particular,
in choosing the most suitable method to model the thermal effect
of circulating blood.

catheter) placed on the target zone of the cardiac tissue. RF
current flows between this electrode and a large patch on the
patient’s back, but the thermal lesion is created exclusively in
the target zone, due to the high-current density being circumscribed to this zone. Since RFCA is always conducted inside
the cardiac chamber, circulating blood is present in the scenario and is expected to have an effect on the created thermal
lesion. The first RFCA theoretical model considered a spherical electrode completely surrounded by tissue, and hence did
not take the circulating blood flow into account [1]. Two years
later, Labonté and Stuchly proposed the first RFCA computer
model, which considered the thermal effect of circulating blood
flow [2]. Their results suggested that heat loss due to circulating
blood flow significantly influences the lesion geometry during
RFCA [3], [4]. From that time on, all models have considered in
one form or another thermal effect of circulating blood. Some
models do not consider blood as part of the model domain, and
consequently, the blood–tissue and blood–electrode interfaces
were really model boundaries [3]–[8] on which an electrical
boundary condition of zero current density was set. Other models consider blood as part of the domain [9]–[21], thus allowing
the RF current to flow through the blood. These models represent the initial value of the impedance (basal impedance) more
realistically than those that do not include blood.
Both model types (with and without blood as part of the domain) include the thermal effect of the circulating blood flow by
assuming a condition of forced thermal convection between the
cardiac surface and circulating blood. The thermal convection
approach requires two parameters to be set: blood temperature
(always considered to be 37 °C) and a thermal convection coefficient, also known as convection film coefficient [22]. The
tissue–blood and electrode–blood interfaces have different thermal convection coefficients (hT and hE , respectively) which
have been estimated for different blood flow rates, depending
on their location in the cardiac chamber. However, there is a wide
variation in the values among the studies, and in fact, Gallagher
[23] has suggested some reasons for this, such as the pulsatile
and turbulent nature of the blood flow, the changing value of the
coefficient at the ablation site, and the high variability among
patients and trials.
In models that include blood as part of the model, it is important to note that blood has a higher electrical conductivity
(σ) than cardiac tissue, and as a result RF current preferentially
flows through blood, so that most of the heat is deposited there.
This fact is even more marked when σ is considered to increase
with temperature, as it implies more heating of the blood, which

is never realistic, since blood temperature remains more or less
constant around 37 °C. Using a thermal convection coefficient
is not expected to offer an accurate temperature distribution in
the blood. In 1999, Jain and Wolf [10] suggested that computer
simulations in which the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity is only considered for the cardiac tissue but not for
the blood could somehow compensate the positive feedback by
which temperature in the blood increases unrealistically.
Subsequently, Jain and Wolf proposed the first RFCA model
to take blood motion into account by estimating the fluid velocity
field [24]. Their results suggested that including the fluid motion
problem provides a realistic distribution of blood temperature
and moreover is able to mimic the asymmetric temperature distribution in tissue and blood, where higher temperatures are
observed on the outflow than the inflow side [24]. However, the
inclusion of this additional problem means higher complexity
and computational requirements. Surprisingly, in spite of not
being able to use a convective boundary condition to model the
blood temperature, they concluded that it provides a reasonable
approximation of the temperature distribution in tissue in the
case of constant voltage [24].
In conclusion, although some efforts have already been made
to compare some of the different methods used to model the effect of the circulating blood flow, the comparisons only consider
the case of constant voltage, and none has ever simultaneously
included all the methods. The comparative performance under
conditions of constant temperature remains unknown. Our objective was to compare simultaneously all the different methods
proposed to date for modeling the effect of the circulating blood
flow, specifically focusing on the blood and tissue temperature
distributions obtained by each method for two RF power delivery modes (constant voltage and constant temperature) and two
conditions of blood flow (high and low).
II. METHODS
A. Description of the Model Geometry
Fig. 1 shows the geometry and dimensions of the threedimensional computational model, which consists of a fragment of a cardiac chamber filled with blood. Blood surrounds
a nonirrigated active electrode, which is placed perpendicular
to the cardiac surface. We considered an ablation electrode 7Fr
in diameter and 4 mm long, as used in clinical practice. The
electrode was assumed to be inserted into the tissue to a depth
(DE ) of 1.25 mm [14]. The model included a temperature sensor (thermistor 0.75 mm × 0.3 mm) embedded in the tip of the
electrode, which was used for the temperature control simulation [5], [14], [20]. The dispersive electrode was modeled as
an electrical boundary condition at a distance from the active
electrode (bottom surface). Cardiac tissue thickness was 20 mm
[24] and the dimensions of the fragment of the cardiac chamber
(X, Y, and Z) were estimated by means of a convergence test
in order to avoid boundary effects. In this test, the value of the
maximal temperature achieved in the tissue (Tm ax ) after 60 s of
RF heating was used as a control parameter. We first considered
a tentative spatial (i.e., minimum meshing size) and temporal
resolution. To determine the appropriate parameters of X and Y

4 (not to scale). Note that the XZ plane is the symmetry plane in our model.
Dimensions X and Y (Z = Y ) of the fragment of the cardiac chamber filled with
blood were obtained from a convergence test. The model geometry for Method
1 is identical, but without blood. The RF current flows between a nonirrigated
active electrode (7Fr, 4 mm) and the dispersive electrode (bottom). The active
electrode is assumed to be inserted into cardiac tissue to a depth DE = 1.25 mm.
The temperature sensor (0.75 × 0.3 mm) is included in the model in order to
implement the constant temperature protocol in which the applied voltage is
modulated to keep a constant temperature of 55 °C in the sensor.

(Z = Y), we increased their values by equal amounts. When the
difference in Tm ax between consecutive simulations was less
than 0.5%, we considered the former values to be adequate.
We then determined adequate spatial and temporal resolution
by means of similar convergence tests using the same control
parameter as in the previous test. Discretization was spatially
heterogeneous: the finest zone was always the electrode–tissue
interface, where the largest voltage gradient was produced and
hence the maximum value of the current density. In the tissue,
the grid size was increased gradually with distance from the
electrode–tissue interface.
B. Governing Equations
The numerical models were based on a coupled electric–
thermal problem which was solved numerically using the finiteelement method and a PARDISO direct solver in COMSOL
Multiphysics software (COMSOL, Burlington, MA, USA).
Simulations were run on a 64-bit PC with an eight-processor
Intel Xeon platform running at 2.67 GHz with 48 GB of RAM.
Time-dependent solutions were 60 s with a time-step of 0.05 s.
The governing equation for the thermal problem was the Bioheat equation modified by the enthalpy method [25], [26], incorporating the phase change in order to model tissue vaporization

been demonstrated both computationally [7] and experimentally
[1] that the blood flowing away in the coronary artery does
not have significant influence on the temperature distribution
during RFCA. Likewise, Qm was not considered because it is
negligible in comparison to the other terms during RFCA [3].

where ρi and ci are the density and specific heat of cardiac tissue
before phase-change (i.e. liquid tissue phase, i = l) and postphase-change (i.e., gas tissue phase, i = g), respectively; Hf g is
the latent heat and C is the tissue water content. We considered
a latent heat value of 2.162×109 J/m3 which corresponds to the
product of the water vaporization latent heat (2257 kJ/kg) and
the water density at 100 °C (958 kg/m3 ), and the tissue water
content inside the cardiac tissue (75%).
At the RF frequencies (500 kHz) used in RF heating and
over the distance of interest, the biological medium can be considered almost totally resistive, since the displacement currents
are much less important than conduction currents. A quasi-static
approach was therefore possible to solve the electrical problem
[28]. Then, the distributed heat source q is given by q = σ|E|2 ,
where |E| is the magnitude of the vector electric field (V/m) and
σ is the electrical conductivity (S/m). E is calculated from E =

D. Boundary Conditions
Fig. 2(a) shows the electrical boundary conditions. Dirichlet
voltage boundary condition was applied at the active electrode
surface. We considered two RF power delivery protocols: constant voltage and constant temperature. For constant voltage,
the active electrode was fixed at 25 V for a period of 60 s. For
constant temperature, we implemented a proportional-integral
control algorithm [32] using MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick,
MA, USA) and the applied voltage was modulated to maintain
the temperature in the sensor at 55 °C [14]. All the outer surfaces of the model except the bottom surface were fixed to zero
electric flux (Neumann boundary condition). The voltage on the
bottom surface was set to 0 V (dispersive electrode) to mimic
a monopolar configuration where the RF current was forced to
flow between the active and dispersive electrodes. We also conducted additional simulations to study the effect of the location
of the dispersive electrode. We considered a new case in which
the dispersive electrode was on the top surface of the model, as
in [11]. In this way, the surface electrode was identical in size
to the bottom surface of the model, so that only the effect of
location was really being assessed.
Fig. 2(b) and (c) shows the thermal and velocity boundary
conditions. The effect of blood circulating inside the cardiac
chamber was modeled by four methods which have been used
in previous studies [3], [5], [9]–[11], [13]–[15], [17], [20], [24].
Each case was assessed under conditions of high and low blood
flow. In all cases, a null thermal flux was used on the symmetry
plane and a constant temperature of 37 °C was fixed on the outer
surfaces of the model at a distance from the ablating electrode
(this was also the initial temperature value).

C. Properties of the Model Elements
The thermal and electrical properties of the model elements
(electrode, thermistor, plastic, blood, and cardiac tissue) are
shown in Table I [13], [14], [29]. The initial temperature in the
entire model was 37 °C. The electrical (σ) and thermal conductivity (k) of cardiac tissue were temperature-dependent functions and were mathematically defined as piecewise functions
(see Equation (4) and (5)): for σ, we considered an exponential

E. Methods for Modeling the Effect of Circulating Blood Flow
Method 1: The model geometry is similar to Fig. 1 but without
including blood. The thermal effect of circulating blood flow
was modeled using the thermal convective coefficients hE and
hT [see Fig. 2(b)] as follows:
n · (k∇T ) = hi (Tb − T )

flow (see text for more details). Note that the model for Method 1 is without blood.

where hi is the thermal convective coefficient (W/m2 ·K) at the
electrode–blood (i = E) or tissue–blood interface (i = T ) and

(24 cm/s) is a reference blood velocity measured at a specific location inside the cardiac chamber [20] and href (=

from uref . We obtained two values of hT for low and high blood
flow: 265 and 610 W/m2 ·K for u of 3 and 8.5 cm/s, respectively
[24]. The thermal convective coefficient at the electrode–blood
interface (hE ) was calculated as

where Nu is the Nusselt number, kb is the blood thermal conductivity (W/m·K), and d is the catheter diameter (7Fr = 2.33 mm).
The Nusselt number can be approximated as follows:

respectively, which are calculated using the following equations:

where cb is the specific heat of blood (J/kgK) and μ is the
viscosity of the blood [2.1×10−3 kg/(m·s)] [14]. We obtained
two hE for low and high flow of blood velocity: 2059 and
3346 W/m2 ·K for u of 3 and 8.5 cm/s, respectively [24].
Method 2: The model geometry corresponds exactly with
Fig. 1, i.e., the blood is included in the domain. In this method,
electrical conductivity of blood was assumed to be constant, as

in previous studies [3], [9], [11], [13]–[15]. As in Method 1,
convective boundary conditions were applied at the electrode–
blood and tissue–blood interfaces to simulate cooling by the
blood flow [see Fig. 2(b)]. The values of hE and hT were identical to Method 1.
Method 3: The method is identical to Method 2 except for the
fact that the electrical conductivity of the blood was considered
to be temperature-dependent with a change rate of +2%/°C
[10], [17].
Method 4: The model geometry is also identical to that shown
in Fig. 1. Here, we directly consider the blood motion in the
model [24] instead of using convective boundary conditions.
We considered a laminar fluid flow, plus the high and low flow
velocities mentioned above [24]. In this case, there is a bidirectional thermal-flow coupled problem, i.e., the incompressible
Navier–Stokes equation from fluid dynamics works together
with the heat transfer equation. Therefore, the so-called advection term [33] was included on the right of (1), which represents
the heat loss due to blood flow

where P is the pressure (Pa), μ is the viscosity of the blood (the
same value as mentioned in Method 1), and F (Fx , Fy , Fz ) is
the volume of forces (N/m3 ), which was absent in this model.
Fig. 2(c) shows the velocity boundary conditions applied in
Method 4. A no slip condition (nonpermeable surface, i.e., the
fluid at the wall was not moving) was applied on the upper
surfaces of the fluid volume, at the symmetry plane (plane XZ in
Fig. 1) and at the tissue–blood and electrode–blood interfaces.

254

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 63, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2016

An inlet boundary condition of velocity type was applied to
the left surface of the fluid volume to simulate the two flow
velocities (in x-direction), while an outlet boundary condition
of zero pressure/no viscous stress was fixed on the right surface
of the fluid volume.
F. Assessment of the Thermal Lesion Dimensions and
Comparison Criterion
As in previous studies, we used the 50 °C isotherm as the thermal lesion contour [10], [11], [13], [14], [17], [20]. Although
Wood et al. concluded that the lethal isotherm for cardiac myocardium is near 61 °C [34], their staining procedure to measure
the area of acute necrosis has been criticized for underestimating the extent of irreversible tissue injury [35]. Consequently,
the range between 50 °C–56 °C is usually considered to faithfully represent the isotherm of irreversible myocardial injury in
hyperthermic ablation.
We compared the thermal lesion dimensions obtained, in particular, the maximum width (W) and depth (D) created in the
cardiac tissue. The maximum temperature values reached in the
tissue and blood (Tm ax tissue and Tm ax blo o d , respectively) in
all four methods were also compared. Since Method 4 provides
the most realistic modeling approach, this was considered as the
reference method, and the results from the other three methods
were compared with it. We considered that the differences in
the lesion depth and width were insignificant for values lower
than 1 mm, since this value is approximately that of the deviation (±0.5 mm) observed in experimental RFCA studies with
a nonirrigated electrode [22], [36]. Likewise, the differences in
Tm ax tissue or Tm ax blo o d were considered to be insignificant
for values lower than 4 °C, since this value is approximately
that of the observed deviation (±2 °C) [22].
III. RESULTS
A. Building the Models
After the convergence tests conducted with the computational
model, we obtained the following optimum values: dimensions
X = 80 mm and Y = 40 mm (Z = Y ), the grid size of 0.2 mm
in the finest zone (electrode-tissue interface), and step time of
0.05 s.
B. Spatial Distributions of Temperature in Tissue and Blood
Fig. 3 shows the temperature distribution in cardiac tissue
and blood after 60 s of RFA considering constant voltage [see
Fig. 3(a)] and temperature control [see Fig. 3(b)] for the four
methods considered. The solid black line indicates the 50 °C
isothermal borderline and therefore outlines the thermal lesion
contour. Tables II and III shows the lesion dimensions, the maximum temperature reached in cardiac tissue and blood, and applied energy for the cases shown in Fig. 3.
With both ablation protocols, temperature distribution in the
blood was symmetrical around the electrode axis for Methods
2 and 3 (where blood flow motion was not taken into account),
while with Method 4 (reference method), the blood temperature
was higher on the outflow side of the electrode. In the same

way, the temperature distribution in the cardiac tissue was only
asymmetrical for Method 4, especially with the constant voltage
protocol. This can be noted as the isothermal line was extended
to the outflow side of the electrode.
C. Constant Voltage Ablation Mode
Blood temperatures (Tm ax blo o d ) computed with Method 4
were considerably lower than those from Methods 2 and 3 (note
that Method 1 does not include blood and hence Tm ax blo o d
cannot be computed). Tm ax blo o d values from Method 4 were
90 °C for low and 80 °C for high blood flow. In contrast,
Method 2, in which blood σ was assumed to be constant, provided values of Tm ax blo o d lower than Method 3 (blood σ is
temperature-dependent): 108.7 °C versus 137.8 °C for low, and
95.4 °C versus 125.9 °C for high blood flow. Tissue temperature
(Tm ax tissue ) was similar between the four methods under high
blood flow conditions (values ranging from 100 to 105 °C). In
contrast, in the case of low blood flow, Methods 1, 2, and 3
provided Tm ax tissue values 5 °C–7 °C lower than Method 4
(103 °C–106 °C versus 111 °C).
All methods provided lesions of similar depth (differences
lower than 1 mm), and only Method 3 provided higher values
for lesion width as compared to Method 4: 2.5 and 1.8 mm bigger
with low and high blood flow, respectively. The total amount of
energy (E) applied during ablation can explain the performance
of each method. Regardless of blood flow, Methods 2 and 4
applied a similar amount of energy (525–543 J), while Method
1 applied much less energy (251–265 J), and Method 3 rather
more (765–825 J).
D. Constant Temperature Ablation Mode
Blood temperatures (Tm ax blo o d ) computed with Method 4
were also lower than with Methods 2 and 3. Tm ax blo o d values
from Method 4 were 60 °C for low and 63.5 °C for high blood
flow. Differences between Tm ax blo o d values from Methods 2
and 3 compared to Method 4 were significantly lower with
constant temperature mode than with constant voltage mode. In
contrast, differences between Tm ax tissue values from Methods
2 and 3 compared to Method 4 under high blood flow conditions
were significantly higher with constant temperature mode than
with constant voltage. Tm ax tissue values from Methods 2 and 3
provided similar results to Method 4 for low blood flow. Method
1 provided Tm ax tissue values significantly higher than Method
4, regardless of blood flow, and this fact was possibly related to
having values of lesion width 1–1.7 mm larger than Method 4.
Methods 2 and 3 had similar lesion width values to Method 4.
All methods provided similar depth lesions (differences lower
than 1 mm). Regardless of blood flow, Method 4 applied the
highest amount of energy than the other methods.
E. Overall Assessment
In this study, Method 4 was assumed to be a reference method,
since theoretically it provided more realistic values of blood
and tissue temperatures. The differences between the values

computed from Method 4 and the others can therefore be considered as a measurement of the error of each method.
In an effort to assess all the five considered outcomes together (lesion depth and width, blood and tissue temperatures,
and amount of applied energy), we calculated the absolute value
of the difference between the outcomes computed from Method
4 and each of the other methods, and plotted the results in a
radar chart as shown in Fig. 4 to provide a sort of performance
metrics of Methods 1, 2, and 3. This allowed us to evaluate
the suitability of each method graphically and easily, since the
relative position of each point from the center is related to its
error. A shorter distance to the center thus means a smaller difference with respect to the results computed with Method 4.
The inclusion of Method 1 in the general analysis is questionable, since it is not able to provide blood temperature values.
In Fig. 4(a) and (b), it can be seen that for the constant voltage
ablation mode, Method 3 values are furthest from Method 4,

regardless of blood flow. Method 2 in general shows the best
fit with Method 4. In the case of constant temperature ablation
mode, Fig. 4(c) and (d) shows that Method 1, which performs
well in the voltage-constant ablation mode, now offers the worst
performance, along with being unable to compute blood temperature. It is important to note that Method 2 performs better
than Method 3, especially for low blood flow.

F. Effect of Short Ablations
The temperature distribution in cardiac tissue and blood, and
the lesion shapes created in the tissue after 30 s of RFA (results
not shown) largely coincided with those shown in Fig. 3. However, we did note some differences within the first 10 s of heating
(see Fig. 5): 1) regarding the lesion shape with constant voltage, Method 4 showed a practically symmetrical temperature

When the dispersive electrode was located on the top surface
of the model, only Methods 2, 3, and 4 could be simulated, since
the Method 1 model did not include this surface (corresponding
to the blood surface). We observed that the lesion shapes were
similar with the dispersive electrode at the top and bottom positions for both ablation protocols. The lesion dimensions (depth
and width) were smaller at the top than at the bottom position,
regardless of ablation protocol. However, the reduced size of the
lesion dimensions with respect to the bottom position (optimal)
was more pronounced with constant voltage than with constant
temperature, especially using Method 3 and high blood flow:
1.3 mm in depth and 1.7 mm in width for constant voltage,
whereas the size was reduced by 0.4 mm in depth and 0.3 mm
in width for constant temperature. The temperature in the tissue
was also reduced with the dispersive electrode in the top position for the two ablation protocols. This drop in temperature
was also more pronounced with constant voltage than with constant temperature, especially with Method 4, considering low
blood flow: 8.8 °C and 0.4 °C for constant voltage and constant
temperature, respectively.
On the other hand, the effect of changing the dispersive electrode position on blood temperature and energy differed with
the ablation protocol used. Both blood temperature and energy

rose with the dispersive electrode in the top position at constant
temperature, whereas these parameters were seen to fall with
the constant voltage protocol. The differences with respect to
the bottom position were always greater at constant voltage than
constant temperature, especially when using Method 3. Blood
temperature was reduced by 12.7 °C using constant voltage for
Method 3 and low blood flow, while it rose by 1 °C for the
same case at constant temperature. With respect to the energy
for the same case (Method 3 and low blood flow), the drop was
103 J using constant voltage, while it rose by 13 J at constant
temperature.
IV. DISCUSSION
A. Comparative Analysis of the Methods
Method 4, considered as the reference method for comparison
purposes, was able to provide a realistic temperature distribution in the blood, with higher values on the outflow side of the
electrode (see Fig. 3). The other methods tested provided symmetrical distributions. These findings had already been reported
for constant voltage ablation mode [24], but not for constant
temperature ablation mode. Our results confirm the same performance in the case of constant temperature mode.
The blood temperatures values obtained with Method 4 were
lower than those from the other three methods, and the differences were higher in the case of constant voltage. Our findings

257

also suggest that the differences between methods are considerable in ablations longer than 10 s, or in other words, the
mathematical mechanisms responsible for providing different
solutions between the four methods increase in importance with
longer times.
Our computer results are in agreement with those obtained by
[11], since they confirm that locating the dispersive electrode in
front of the ablating electrode (i.e., on the bottom surface of the
model) produces larger lesions (both in depth and width) and
higher temperatures in the cardiac tissue than locating it behind
the tip (i.e., in the top surface of the model), considering both
the constant voltage and constant temperature protocols.
Since Methods 1, 2, and 3 do not include the blood motion
problem, they are easier than Method 4 in terms of computational complexity. It is therefore crucial to determine which
of them could be used instead of Method 4 to achieve similar
computational results in terms of the lesion size, and blood and
tissue temperatures. The conditions of this equivalence have to
be stated in each case, i.e., according to the ablation mode used
and blood flow conditions. For instance, our results show that
all Methods (1, 2, and 3) predict similar values of the lesion
depth (differences smaller than 1 mm), regardless of ablation
mode and blood flow conditions. Method 3, in which electrical
conductivity of blood is temperature-dependent, offers a worse
prediction of the lesion depth for constant voltage, as suggested
by Jain and Wolf [10]. However, this prediction is somewhat
better in the case of constant temperature [see Figs. 4(c) and
(d)]. Furthermore, our results show that Method 1, the simplest
one because blood is not included in the model domain, offers
a better prediction of the lesion depth than Method 3 in the case
of constant voltage, but not in the case of constant temperature.
Similarly, Method 3 fails to predict the lesion width in the case
of constant voltage (differences higher than 1 mm with Method
4), while Method 1 fails in the case of constant temperature (see
Fig. 4). In short, in order to predict the lesion depth and width,
Methods 1 and 2 seem to be suitable in the case of constant
voltage, while Methods 2 and 3 would be suitable for constant
temperature ablation.
Surprisingly, despite the potential of Methods 1, 2, and 3 to
predict reasonably well both lesion depth and width, all offer
a poor estimate of the maximum temperatures reached in the
tissue (Tm ax tissue ). Only for voltage-constant ablation mode
and high blood flow, all methods offer values of Tm ax tissue
similar to Method 4. If all circumstances are taken into account
(two ablation modes and two blood flow conditions), Method
2 performs best. Finally, in regard to predicting the maximum
temperatures reached in the blood (Tm ax blo o d ), only Methods 2
and 3 are reasonable, and once more Method 2 shows lower prediction errors. Note that the axis scale of Tm ax blo o d is different
in cases of constant voltage [see Fig. 4(a) and (b)] and constant
temperature [see Fig. 4(c) and (d)], and prediction errors are
much smaller in the case of constant temperature.
It is interesting to observe the results of Method 1 in detail. For the constant temperature mode, Method 1 has a poor
performance (see dashed lines in Fig. 4(c) and (d)), but for
constant-voltage ablation, it offers low prediction errors for the
lesion size and Tm ax tissue (similar to Method 2). The only

258

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 63, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2016

difference with Method 1 is the amount of applied energy,
around half of that used in Method 4. This is precisely the cause
of the good performance of Method 1 under constant-voltage
conditions: since the blood is not included in the model domain,
the total impedance with Method 1 is significantly higher than
with the other methods (blood, whose electrical conductivity is
even higher than cardiac tissue, is absent). The delivered current,
and hence the applied power, is lower. In other words, although
in Method 1 all the RF power is exclusively applied to the cardiac tissue, which could imply better heating and hence bigger
lesions, the high impedance value allows two opposing factors
to be balanced. Moreover, since Method 1 excludes blood from
the model domain, this method would be really modeling a
blood-free scenario, as actually happens in surgical RF cardiac
ablation (epicardial ablation on a pumping heart or endocardial
ablation on a stopped heart).
If one takes all the items into account (lesion size and maximum temperature reached in blood and tissue), Method 2 seems
to be the most suitable alternative, since it provides similar values to Method 4. Interestingly, the four methods offered lesion
sizes almost identical in the first seconds (see Fig. 5), which
suggests that the differences are larger over time.
Finally, the computational time required to solve the models
with Method 2 was about seven times less than that required by
Method 4. For example, the computer simulation of the model
using temperature constant ablation protocol and high blood
flow took almost 3 h with Method 4 and around 25 min with
Method 2. This finding is surely relevant for future theoretical
RFCA models when blood is not included in the model domain, and also in order to assess retrospectively the results from
previous computational studies.
B. Comparison with Experimental Results
Only the study by Jain and Wolf [24] provides solid results on
the appropriateness of Method 4 as compared to Method 2 (the
best alternative in terms of predicting the thermal lesion size)
for the case of constant voltage. By comparing their computer
and experimental results, Jain and Wolf demonstrated that both
methods were able to predict the experimental temperatures in
the tissue with a mean error of less than 6 °C. This is in line
with our results using constant voltage, since Methods 2 and 4
provided lesion depths and widths similar to within 1 mm (see
Table II). On the other hand, in order to predict the temperature
distribution in the fluid, Jain and Wolf [24] reported that while
Method 4 showed a mean error < 7 °C (compared to their
experimental results), Method 2 had a mean error of as much
as 40 °C. All this suggests that Method 4 would be the only
method able to predict blood temperature during a constant
voltage ablation.
In the case of constant temperature, Matsudaira et al. [37]
found experimentally that temperature distribution in the blood
was clearly nonsymmetrical around the electrode axis, with
higher values on the side opposite to the blood flow. They also
found that the maximal temperature in the blood was 68.3 ±
4.3 °C with a 4-mm electrode after 60 s of ablation, 55 °C
target temperature, and high blood flow condition. Although

this temperature value is reasonably close to the values of
Tm ax blo o d obtained by us with Methods 2 and 4 (69.6 °C and
63.5 °C, respectively), only Method 4 was able to reproduce the
asymmetry in blood temperature around the electrode axis, as
observed experimentally by Matsudaira et al. [37].
Regarding the thermal lesion dimensions using constant temperature, our computer results are comparable to those obtained
by Balázs et al. [39] using an ex vivo experimental model. Although their aim was to compare the performance of gold- and
platinum–iridium-tip RF electrodes, they used 4-mm nonirrigated electrodes with a constant temperature mode (50 °C target) for 60 s, which was very similar to the conditions of our
computer simulations. They obtained thermal lesions, 5.75 mm
in depth and 10.00 mm in width, which are approximately in
agreement with those obtained by us for constant temperature
(55 °C target) by Methods 2, 3, and 4 (see Table III). In fact,
our results suggest that any of these three methods can suitably
predict lesion dimensions in the case of constant temperature.
The comparison with results by Balázs et al. [39] suggests that
our model, regardless of the method used, predicts the lesion
depth and width reasonably well. The difference in applied energy between these authors’ [39] experimental results (0.92 kJ)
and our simulations (0.35 kJ) was possibly due to the higher
flow used in their experiments (50 cm/s versus 8.5 cm/s). It is
well known that the presence of blood flow increases the RF
power required to maintain the same target temperature [37].
Additionally, we can compare our computer results in the case
of constant temperature with those obtained by Jain et al. [11]
using an in vivo model. They found thermal lesions 5.8 ± 0.8
mm in depth and 9.3 ± 1.9 mm in width, which are also very
close to our results, even though Jain et al. [11] employed a
slightly higher target temperature (60 °C instead of 55 °C).
It is almost impossible to compare the values of Tm ax tissue
obtained from our simulations to those from experimental studies, since the maximum tissue temperature is reached 1 mm
under the electrode (see Fig. 3), while tissue temperatures are
usually measured at depths of 3 and 7 mm [37]. However,
Method 4 was the only method able to provide a nonsymmetrical temperature distribution around the ablating electrode axis—
note that the surface width of the thermal lesion computed in the
tissue was considerably greater on the blood outflow side (see
Fig. 3). This is also in agreement with the experimental results
obtained by Matsudaira et al. [37] and Jain and Wolf [38], who
found that the temperature reached in the cardiac tissue on the
outflow side was greater than on the inflow side.
In conclusion, the comparison between our computer results
and the experimental results from previous studies suggests that:
1) the proposed model with Methods 2 and 4 allows the thermal
lesion dimensions to be realistically reproduced, and 2) Method
4 in particular allows the temperature distributions in the blood
to be reproduced.
C. Limitations of the Study
The constant power mode was not considered in this study.
This mode is usually employed with irrigated electrodes and
not with dry electrodes, as modeled here. In spite of this, it was

GONZÁLEZ-SUÁREZ AND BERJANO: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT METHODS OF MODELING THE THERMAL EFFECT

observed that for a 15-W 60-s ablation with dry electrodes, the
applied voltage does not vary more than 2 V throughout ablation
[10], and consequently, constant voltage and constant power can
be considered to be comparable in the context of this study.
V. CONCLUSION
Only Method 4 seems to provide a realistic blood temperature
distribution. By assuming this method as a reference method, our
findings suggest that the three methods considered are able to
predict values of the lesion depth similar to those of the reference
method (differences smaller than 1 mm), regardless of ablation
mode and blood flow conditions. Finally, bearing all the items in
mind (lesion size and maximum temperature reached in blood
and tissue), Method 2 seems to be the most suitable alternative
to Method 4 in terms of reducing the computational complexity.
