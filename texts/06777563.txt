Priority-Based Time-Slot Allocation in Wireless
Body Area Networks During Medical
Emergency Situations: An Evolutionary
Game-Theoretic Perspective
Sudip Misra, Senior Member, IEEE, and Subhadeep Sarkar

Abstract—In critical medical emergency situations, wireless
body area network (WBAN) equipped health monitoring systems
treat data packets with critical information regarding patients’
health in the same way as data packets bearing regular healthcare
information. This snag results in a higher average waiting time for
the local data processing units (LDPUs) transmitting data packets
of higher importance. In this paper, we formulate an algorithm for
Priority-based Allocation of Time Slots (PATS) that considers a fitness parameter characterizing the criticality of health data that a
packet carries, energy consumption rate for a transmitting LDPU,
and other crucial LDPU properties. Based on this fitness parameter, we design the constant model hawk–dove game that ensures
prioritizing the LDPUs based on crucial properties. In comparison
with the existing works on priority-based wireless transmission, we
measure and take into consideration the urgency, seriousness, and
criticality associated with an LDPU and, thus, allocate transmission time slots proportionately. We show that the number of transmitting LDPUs in medical emergency situations can be reduced
by 25.97%, in comparison with the existing time-division-based
techniques.
Index Terms—Hawk–dove game, priority-based allocation of
time slots, wireless body area network (WBAN).

I. INTRODUCTION
EALTHCARE in modern days has been undergoing crucial changes, as the common practice of clinical treatment is gradually being overhauled by ubiquitous healthcare
systems [1]. In the past decade, healthcare organizations underwent steep rise of pressure to provide improved healthcare, as the
number of chronic disease patients steeply increases every year
world wide [2], [3]. Chronic diseases such as heart and lung diseases require real time, continuous, and long-term follow-ups.
WBANs [4] can help in ubiquitous and remote health monitoring of patients [5], [6]. Table I lists the important physiological
parameters that can be monitored by wireless body area sensors.
We also discuss the type of physiological parameter monitored,

that operate on the IEEE Standard 802.15.6-2012 (IEEE Standard 802.15.6-2012 is a standardization specifically designed to
support WBAN-based communications).
A WBAN comprises of multiple heterogeneous body sensor devices which are capable of monitoring different health
attributes, record it in the form of raw health data, and subsequently transmit the data to a local data processing unit (LDPU).
The LDPU temporarily stores the health data specific to a patient, and disseminates the same for follow-up analyses. Doctors
can remotely monitor patients’ physiological condition in real
time, and provide crucial medical suggestions in less time. Our
paper focuses on WBAN-based remote healthcare and medical
services in situations of medical emergencies. We propound an
efficient solution of the challenges encountered from a communication perspective while health data are transmitted in a
critical medical situation.
A. Motivation
In situations of medical emergencies, multiple LDPUs may
transmit healthcare data simultaneously during the same time
interval. It is important to discriminate the LDPUs transmitting
critical heath data from the ones transmitting data of regular importance. In such cases, frequency division-based transmission
in a multisource-single-sink network results in flooding of the
sink’s receiver buffer. This leads to packet loss and consequent
retransmission of the regenerated packets. Moreover, it fails to
establish priority among the transmitting LDPUs, based on the
criticality of the healthcare information being transmitted. An

alternate time division-based wireless transmission scheme
could, however, prevent the receiver-buffer from being overwhelmed by excessive data arrival-rate. But the major limitation
of this uniform time-slot distribution algorithm is that it fails to
assign priorities to the transmitting LDPUs based on the importance of the health data that is being transmitted. Also, due to
nondiscrimination of data packets, every sender (LDPU) has to
wait for a fixed number of time slots before it gets its turn again.
However, from a judgemental perspective, the transmitting
LDPUs should have a waiting time proportionate to the criticality of their health condition.
B. Contribution
Our paper addresses the aforesaid issues by analyzing
priority-based time-slot allocation along LDPUs during critical medical emergency situations from an evolutionary gametheoretic perspective. The primary contributions of this paper
are listed below.
1) Critical LDPU-properties such as the importance of health
data to be transmitted, energy dissipation factor of an
LDPU, and time elapsed since last successful transmission
are taken into account to formulate a fitness parameter for
each LDPU to which the sensor nodes broadcast. Through
this formulation, we compute a relative measure of node
importance and, thus, prioritize their influence.
2) We design an algorithm for priority-based allocation of
time slots (PATS) based on an evolutionary game, referred
to as the constant model hawk–dove game, which allows
the LDPUs to choose its strategy based on its fitness.
Adoption of such strategy enables the LDPUs with important health-data gain preference over the regular ones.
3) LDPUs with higher fitness are awarded with the highest
preference ensuring minimum waiting time between successive transmissions of data packets.
II. RELATED WORKS
Karim et al. [7] proposed a priority-based preemptive packet
scheduling algorithm that outperforms the traditional FCFS and
multilevel queue schedulers in terms of transmission delay. A
learning-automata-like random early detection (LALRED) of
congestion in wired networks is proposed in [8]. The goal
of LALRED is to optimize the queue size based on a learning automaton and, thus, detect and avoid congestion early.
Michopoulos et al. [9] discussed about packet loss, lower
throughput, and energy inefficiency in congested wireless sensor networks (WSN). The proposed algorithm automatically
adjusts a node’s data forwarding strategy with a view of minimal packet drops due to congestion. Congestion control in WSN
using ant-based agents is discussed in [10]. In [11], the authors
have analyzed the importance of packet drops in WSN through
the evaluation of link quality between network nodes. They have
used a variant of link state protocol where all nodes gather information regarding the link packet loss from all neighbours.
Based on this packet drop information table, each node chooses
a cluster head. A fusion of three different techniques spanning
across three different layers, viz., hop-by-hop flow control, rate

limiting source traffic in the presence of transit traffic, and a
prioritized medium access control (MAC) protocol are implemented in [12] to improve WSN efficiency. But in context of
WBANs, these protocols are deficient as no internode priority
considerations are made. Therefore, no distinction can be drawn
between LDPUs transmitting crucial health data from the ones
that transmit regular health check-up related data packets. Also,
a WBAN consists of heterogeneous sensor nodes—each node
has a specific purpose to monitor some specific health parameters. Clearly, in a cluster of such nodes, every node should not
be assigned the same priority.
In [13], the authors contributed toward the convergent feature of traffic in WBANs in certain cases which involve packet
loss, retransmission, delay in packet delivery, and consumption
of extraneous energy arising due to congestion. The authors,
however, do not enlighten on the importance of body sensors
transmitting critical life-saving health data. A game-theoretic
approach to minimize contention delay is proposed in [14]. A
modified carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance
(CSMA/CA) protocol is used to allow one sensor at a time to
deviate from the standard rules and act like a “cheater.” The network performance is analytically derived using a Markov model
for worst-case conditions. Misra et al. [15] proposed a learning
automata-based congestion avoidance scheme (LACAS) that
proves to be an efficient automata-based congestion avoidance
policy. However, most of these works do not take into consideration the important factor associated with the health data to
be transmitted. Our paper, nonetheless, is distinctive due to the
specific contributions made for the use of WBANs in medical
emergency situations.
III. COMMUNICATION ARCHITECTURE
Ubiquitous health monitoring relies on some special characteristics of wireless body sensor nodes. The basic principle of
these sensors is that the source of the signals received is the living tissue. In this paper, we discuss the problem scenario only
from an on-body sensor perspective. These body sensor nodes
are mounted on the patient’s body to enable remote monitoring of health parameters. Each such sensor node is deployed
to monitor a specific health parameter. For instance, a pulse
oximeter measures the oxygen saturation level in blood and the
heart rate [16], and an EKG sensor monitors and records the
EKG-graph for a patient [17], [18].
The on-body sensor nodes sense health parameters as a continuous function of time, and transmit the same to a portable
LDPU via Bluetooth or ZigBee. These LDPUs, in turn, disseminate the data acquired to an anchor node placed inside a
medical ward of a hospital. Such a medical ward may have
multiple anchor nodes situated distantly to act as a sink to the
neighboring LDPUs deployed on patients admitted in that ward.
The events sensed and data collected by the body sensors are
broadcasted to this sink (LDPU). LDPUs may be designed to
communicate with its concerned anchor node through GPRS or
Wi-Fi. The anchor nodes are capable of transmitting data packets
to remote health-data acquisition center over the Internet for
real-time analyses of sensed data. Any deviation from standard

health data is taken into account, and necessary actions, treatments, or even medicines are rushed to the concerned patient
as per doctor’s recommendation. Fig. 1 provides a pictorial presentation of the WBAN communication architecture.
IV. FORMULATION OF UTILITY FUNCTION
In this section, we focus on designing a “fitness parameter”
that is used as a measure of LDPU priority. The value of the
fitness parameter at time t (Ψt ) for an LDPU is mathematically
calculated based on certain parameters such as 1) the energy dissipation factor, 2) token starvation factor, and most importantly,
3) health-data criticality factor. We discuss the importance of
these factors in the formulation of the fitness parameter below.
A. Energy Dissipation Factor
Sensor nodes are, in general, capacitated with limited amount
of energy to survive on. Consequently, energy looms large as a
constraint for these sensing devices, and, therefore, is crucially
important to ensure that the rate of dissipation of energy can be
minimized for these sensors. On the other hand, thermal energy
harvesting has emanated to be path breaking [19], [20] in the
context of body sensor nodes. Few popular sources to harvest
energy for body sensors are movement of limbs, locomotion of
the human, or even the human body temperature. The prototype development of thermoelectric generator (TEG) chips has
certainly acted as a major boost in practical implementation domains involving WBANs. Energy dissipation in an LDPU may
result due to multiple reasons, as listed below.
Sensing energy (Esn ): As body sensor nodes continuously
monitor and record the concerned health parameter of a person
over time, there is continuous drainage of energy in sensing.
The energy expanded due to sensing in a single time slot by
each body sensor node is denoted as Esn .
Transmission Energy (Etr ): The transmission energy of a
body sensor node Etr is the energy dissipated due to the trans-

543

mission of a single data packet by that node. The packet may be
either originated from the node itself, or it could have reached the
node as an intermediate hop toward its destination. Etr usually
has a higher magnitude, as broadcasting of health parameters in
the form of packets requires considerable amount of energy.
Processing Energy (Epr ): In a WBAN, a body sensor node not
only acts as a sensing device, but also as a routing device. As a
part of intra-WBAN communications, each body sensor receives
numerous data packets from multiple other sensors, and route
those data packets further, either toward the destination anchor
node, or toward another body sensor in its path, after processing
the data packet. Processing energy Epr of a body sensor is the
energy expended due to processing of a single packet retrieved
from the input buffer, and subsequent mapping of the same to
its destination through the routing table.
Computational Energy (Ecm ): The energy consumed to perform preliminary computations on the raw sensed data before it
is converted into a packet is termed as the computational energy
of that node, and is denoted by Ecm . It is noted that the energy
consumption due to computations is much less compared to the
energy exhausted due to transmission of a data packet.
Definition 1 (Nodal Energy Dissipation Factor): The nodal
energy dissipation factor Ed t ,i is defined as the maximum energy expended by the ith body sensor node after t time slots is
defined as the sum of the energy consumed due to sensing Esn ,
transmissions Etr , processing Epr , and computations Ecm purposes, and the energy exhausted due to channel conditions (such
as path fading, path loss, and BER) and, varied signal strength
(Ech ). Ed t ,i and is represented as
Ed t ,i = Esn ×t+Etr × N +Epr ×n+Ecm ×(N − n)+Ech
(1)
where n and N refer to the number of packets received and
transmitted by a node during t slots.
For nodes capable of harvesting energy, Definition 1 can be
modified as
Ed t ,i = Esn × t + Etr × N + Epr × n + Ecm
× (N − n) − Ehr × t + Ech .

(2)

Definition 2 (Energy Dissipation Factor): We define the energy dissipation factor of an LDPU at time t (ξt ) as the ratio
of the total energy dissipated after t time slots by Z number of
component body sensors connected to the LDPU to the sum of
each of their initial energy levels. Mathematically,
ξt =

i=1

Ein it,j 0 ≤ ξt ≤ 1

(3)

j =1

where Ein it,j is the energy of the jth body sensor at time t = 0
and Ed t ,i follows from Definition 1.
B. Token Starvation Factor
In our algorithm, an LDPU may not transmit a data packet
without bothering about the transmission status of the other
LDPUs. It can only transmit its packets upon reception of a
permission token from the anchor node it is connected to. Fol-

544

lowing the acquisition of the token, an LDPU sends data packets
within its permissible time slots.
Let τt denote the time-stamp corresponding to the last token
acquisition by an LDPU, i.e., the time an LDPU has last started
transmission of a data packet. Clearly, τi can be computed as
τi = τc − τ t

(4)

where τc indicates the current system time, and τt gives an
estimate of the time interval during which the LDPU has been
idle since its last transmission. Evidently, τc has a magnitude
greater than or equal to τt , indicating τi ≥ 0. Again, let each time
slot, for which the LDPUs contend, be of δ duration (δ > 0).
Definition 3 (Idle Time Slots): Idle time slots of an LDPU
νt is expressed as the ceiling of the ratio of the time duration
elapsed since the LDPU has last transmitted τi to the duration
of a single slot δ
νt = τi /δ.

(5)

Definition 4 (Limiting Idle Time Slot): Limiting idle time slot
νm ax is the maximum number of time slots that an LDPU may
theoretically spend without transmitting. νm ax is expressed as
νm ax = 2M (t) − 1

(6)

where M (t) denotes the number of LDPUs associated with the
concerned anchor node. Hence, νt ∈ {0, 1, . . . , (2M (t) − 1)}.
Definition 5 (Token Starvation Factor): Token starvation factor for an LDPU at time t (Υt ) is defined as the ratio of the
number of time slots the LDPU has been idle since its last
transmission (νt ) to the limiting idle time-slot value (νm ax ),
Υt = νt /νm ax

(7)

As νt < νm ax , 0 ≤ Υt ≤ 1.
C. Health Severity Index
The third and the most important factor taken into consideration is the health severity of the patients. In this paper, we put
forward a generalized metric for the measurement of average
importance of the healthcare data that are to be transmitted by
the LDPU at a given time instant.
Let, for person of a given age and gender, the reference range
of a particular health parameter that is being monitored, be
within Θlc and Θu c , under normal health conditions. Θlc and
Θu c denote the upper and lower limits of the reference range,
respectively. At a given time t, the recorded value of that particular health parameter is denoted by Θt . A brief description of
the standard procedure for obtaining Θlc and Θu c is described
in Appendix A.
Definition 6 (Health Severity Index): The health severity index
of a patient at time t is denoted by ρt . It is mathematically
expressed as


 (Θ − Θ )2 − (Θ − Θ )2 

 uc
t
t
lc
(8)
ρt = 
.


(|Θu c | + |Θlc |)2
Clearly, ρt = 0 when Θt = (Θlc + Θu c )/2. Theoretically, in
some cases, the value of rhot may exceed 1 (which is hardly the

case in practical scenarios). In such cases, ρt is approximated to
1 for computational benefit. Therefore, in practice, 0 ≤ ρt ≤ 1.
Finally, after properly defining the factors that influence the
fitness parameter Ψt , we define it in Definition 7.
Definition 7 (Fitness Parameter): The fitness parameter Ψt
of a patient at time t is defined as the weighted average of
the energy dissipation factor ξt , token starvation factor Υt , and
health severity index ρt of that patient. Ψt is mathematically
expressed as
λ1 ξt + λ2 Υt + λ3 ρt
(9)
λ1 + λ2 + λ3
where λ1 , λ2 , and λ3 are constant values specific to the health
parameters to be measured. Also, they depend on the patient’s
age, sex, and past medical history. The value of Ψt ranges between 0 ≤ Ψt ≤ 1. A high value of Ψt indicates that an LDPU
is willing to transmit highly critical health data of the concerned
patient, and vice versa.
Ψt =

V. PATS: PRIORITY-BASED ALLOCATION OF TIME SLOTS
In this section, we propose an algorithm for priority-based
allocation of time slots (PATS) using an extension of the evolutionary game theory [21]. The primary advantage of game theory
is that it provides insight into situations that arise due to conflict
of interests and individual profit maximization strategies. It develops a mathematical framework to analyze decision making
where interdependence of the players is considered. Evolutionary game theory is a branch of classical game theory [22] which
involves repeated interactions within the population. Each entity in the population adopts a game-playing strategy, and acts
in accordance with a particular strategy. The pay-offs corresponding to the strategy depend on the strategies adopted by the
coplayers as well. Unlike similar existing algorithms, in evolutionary game theory, an individual’s move during a game is not
out of deliberation; rather, it is an act driven by learning. The
process is similar to natural selection to determine how the population evolves. In comparison with similar other approaches,
such as greedy algorithms, evolutionary game theory-based solution approach not only adds dynamicity to the algorithm, but
also, allows the LDPUs to strategize. In this paper, we design an
n-player, noncooperative evolutionary game algorithm, termed
as, the constant model hawk–dove game, which can be treated
as a variant of the traditional hawk–dove game.
In the game proposed in this paper, the anchor nodes stand
as the game coordinator with the LDPUs connected to it as the
participating players of the game. A new game is played after
every T interval of time. Mathematically,
T =  + kδ

(10)

where k is the total number of time slots to be distributed among
the LDPUs, each of duration δ, and  is the overhead time
spent by the anchor node for game computation, evaluation, and
analyses.
In our game model, a player (an LDPU) can take either an
aggressive strategy (hawk) or a timid one (dove), based on the
fitness parameter Ψt . The resource that the LDPUs play for
is the time slot(s) that allow(s) an LDPU to transmit its data

MISRA AND SARKAR: PRIORITY-BASED TIME-SLOT ALLOCATION IN WBAN DURING MEDICAL EMERGENCY SITUATIONS

545

packets over the acquired time slots. As we have shown before,
0 ≤ Ψt ≤ 1. An LDPU chooses the hawk or dove policy (S =
{H, D}) according to the following strategy:

where φ1 and φ2 are LDPU specific, experimental constants,
typically ranging of 0 < φ1 , φ2 < 1 and φ1 < φ2 . φ1 indicates
the value of Ψt , below which an LDPU is bound to adopt the
dove strategy. If Ψt has a value above φ2 , the LDPU adopts the
hawk policy. An intermediate value of Ψt lets an LDPU choose
the hawk strategy with p probability, and the dove strategy with
complementary probability, based on its learning. The value
of p (0 ≤ p ≤ 1) is determined by a player as a part of its
learning policy. Each LDPU chooses a policy whenever it opts
to send some data packets, and sends its choice (H or D) to the
connected anchor node. The anchor node receives multiple such
requests for the contention of time slots. It, then, sends back
tokens in a prioritized fashion among the LDPUs. For a set of
LDPUs L = {L1 , L2 , . . . , Lm t } connected to an anchor node,

L j ∈B ,B ⊆L

= ∅, |A| + |B| = mt (12)
where |A| and |B| are the number of players adopting H or
D strategies, respectively. k1 is the number of slots allocated
to each hawk. The total number of LDPUs willing to transmit
at time t is given by mt . Clearly, mt ≤ M (t). We introduce
a function f (·, ·) to compute the time slots to be distributed
among the dove-strategic LDPUs. f (·, ·) considers the number
of hawks h and doves d as inputs, such that h + d = mt and is
expressed as
	
1
if d < k%h
f (h, d) =
(13)
b, b ∈ {0, 1} otherwise
where k%h are the slots remaining to be distributed among
the doves. f assigns every dove a unit time slot if possible,
otherwise it assigns unit time slot to few randomly chosen doves.
We design and analyze the pay-off matrix corresponding to the
constant model hawk–dove game as shown in Table I. It is
designed for a specific scenario, where a total of (mt = x +
y + 1) LDPUs wish to transmit data at time t. For an h-hawk-ddove system, hawks are each awarded with 
 hk  unit time slots,
and the doves are awarded time slots as per f (·, ·). Algorithm 1
elaborates the time-slot allocation by the LDPU.
Using PATS, we achieve two objectives. First, we distinguish
the LDPUs possessing critical health data and willing to transmit from the ones transmitting regular health check-up related
data. This helps us to increase the precedence of nodes transmitting important data packets, and, to ensure that critical healthcare data packets are transmitted before the regular ones. Thus,
we minimize the transmission delay for these critical packets.
Second, we ensure that other nodes are restricted to transmit

when a node with critical health data does so. This diminishes
the chance of packet collision in the network, and also the chance
of the LDPU input-buffer overflow. We now discuss some of the
results obtained through PATS in WBAN.
Proposition 1: The running time complexity of PATS is
O(mt ), where mt is the number of LDPUs that has a frame
to transmit at time t.
Proof: We obtain the recurrence relation for PATS from
Algorithm 1 as
T (mt ) = T (mt − 1) + c, T (1) = c

(14)

where T (mt ) is the time taken to execute PATS for mt number
of LDPUs. The running time complexity for executing lines 12
through 21 of Algorithm 1 is c = Θ(1). We obtain the recurrence
relation for the computational time complexity of PATS as
T (mt ) = T (mt − k) + kc.

(15)

Finally, we get,
T (mt ) = T (1) + (m1 − 1)c
⇒ T (mt ) = O(m1 − 1)  O(mt ).
This completes the proof.

TABLE II
PAY-OFF MATRIX FOR Constant Model Hawk–Dove Game

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS

Corollary 1: For an h-hawk-d-dove system, the tightest lower
bound of the LDPUs allowed to transmit within T interval is
O(h).
Proof: For a total of k time slots available during a single
iteration, the hawks are allocated time slots as per Table II, prior
to the doves. The total number of slots htot allocated to the
hawks is given by
htot = h × 
k/h.

(17)

Now, in order to obtain the tightest lower bound of the number of LDPUs allowed to transmit, minimum number of doves
should be allowed to transmit during the same iteration. Thus,
we have
k = htot = h × 
k/h
⇒ k − (h × 
k/h) = 0
⇒ k = ch, c = 1, 2, . . . , upto ∞
⇒ k%h = 0.
This implies that no time slots are allocated for doves. Only
the hawks are allowed to transmit. Thus, the tightest upper bound
for the number of LDPUs transmitting within T interval is equal
to O(h).This completes the proof.

Proposition 2: Unlike the existing time-based or frequencybased transmissions of mt LDPUs within time T , PATS reduces
the number of transmitting LDPUs by mt − h − min(d, k%h).
Proof: We assume that mt is the total number of transmitting
LDPUs present in the system at time t.
For an h-hawk-d-dove system (where, h + d = mt ), the total
number of time slots allocated to h hawks is given by h
 hk .
Therefore, the number of remaining slots for that iteration is
k − h
 hk  = k%h.
This implies that the total number of doves that are allowed
to transmit is expressed as min(d, k%h). Therefore, the total
number of LDPUs that are awarded with time slots during an
iteration w is expressed as
w = h + min(d, k%h).

(18)

Clearly, mt ≥ w. Consequently, the number of LDPUs that
are debarred from transmission during that cycle is
mt − w = mt − h − min(d, k%h).

(19)

On the contrary, in existing time-based or frequency-based
data transmission techniques, all the requesting LDPUs are allowed to transmit during every cycle. Therefore, in such cases,
the number of transmitting LDPUs remain mt . This completes
the proof.


In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed
algorithm, PATS, using MATLAB. We study the variation of Ψt
with the variation of each contributing factor, and measure and
compare the results in each such case. We also project some
performance comparison of PATS with standard TDMA and
FDMA transmission protocols.
A. Effect of the Contributing Factors
on the Fitness Parameter
Experimental Settings: The experimental WBAN system consists of 30 LDPUs. We first show the impact while plotting the
LDPU-fitness Ψt against a parameter, the other two parameters
are kept constant (in our case, 0.5). Also, the values of λ1 , λ2 ,
and λ3 are taken as 3, 2, and 5, respectively, to ensure ordered
preference among the three factors.
Fig. 2(a) shows the plot of the energy dissipation factor ξt
against Ψt . Analyzing the graph, we observe that, with a wide
range of variation in the value of ξt , Ψt varies mostly between
0.35 and 0.65, denoting a variation of around 0.15 in either side
of its mean value (0.5). Fig. 2(b) depicts the fluctuation of the
value of Ψt with the change in the token starving factor Υt . We
observe that the variation of the values of Ψt lies within 0.1 units
of the mean value, in each side of it, symbolizing a comparative
low impact of Υt on Ψt . In Fig. 2(c), the plot of health severity
index ρt against Ψt is shown. Unlike the previous two cases,
we observe that the values of Ψt are generally spread widely
between 0.25 and 0.75, in either side of the mean (0.5). A higher
variance indicates a higher influence of ρt on Ψt , compared to
the other two factors.
After analyzing the above three graphs thoroughly, we attain a clearer perspective regarding the influence of certain
factors on Ψt , and also an impression on the assignments of
the weights (λ1 , λ2 , and λ3 ) corresponding to each of the
factors.
B. Performance Analysis
Experimental Settings: The experiments performed for performance analyses involve wireless communication over a single AWGN channel for 20 LDPUs over 20 time slots. The
data modulation scheme used is BPSK and the buffer size at
the receiver end are assumed to be constant throughout the
experiments.
Fig. 3(a) demonstrates the comparison of the number of
LDPUs allowed to transmit to the total number of such LDPUs present in the system. Unlike the standard TDMA solutions, PATS considers the fitness of the LDPUs while allocating time slots, thereby prioritizing the critical data transmitting
LDPUs by rewarding with higher number of time slots. PATS
also outperforms traditional FDMA and advanced orthogonal
FDMA (OFDMA) [23] solutions with respect to the number
of packet drops, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Since the number of
transmitting LDPUs is considerably reduced, eventually only
the critical data packets manage to the receiver end successfully, thereby, improving the packet drop rate remarkably. As a

consequence of the packet drop rate, the total energy exhausted
due to transmission and successive retransmission(s) is also reduced, as reflected in Fig. 3(c).

VII. CONCLUSION
This paper considers an evolutionary game model that allows
an LDPU to adopt an active or a passive strategy while transmitting sensed data, and compete in the game. A fair game strategy
based on LDPU-fitness helps LDPUs that run low on energy,
or transmit crucial data, or has been idle for a longer period,
through gaining higher priority. We conclude that controlled
transmission by the LDPUs not only diminishes the average
number of packets transmitted over the WBAN during a time
interval, but also ensures distinctive reduction in the packetdrop rate and the energy dissipation. Most importantly, PATS
rewards critical LDPUs with higher number of time slots, and,
thus, eventually prioritizing patients with high severity in health
conditions.
Finally, our future works include investigating variable buffering delays and variable queue capacities. Also, we have an aim
to implement PATS in a prototype model of medical disasters.
Implementation of LDPU-specific health data importance factor
is also a challenge as each LDPU collects health data from the
heterogeneous body sensors. An intelligent measure of variance
of measured health data from a standard dataset is always a
challenge.

APPENDIX A
REFERENCE RANGE CALCULATION
The upper and lower limiting values of the range is often
estimated by the t-distribution. For a normal sample size of n
(n > 0), first the mean(x̄) is computed as

n
xi
x̄ = i=1 , ∀x = 1(1)n.
n
Then, the standard deviation of the sample sx is computed as


n
 1 
(xi − x̄)2 .
sx = +
n − 1 i=1
However, as the population mean μ and the population standard
deviation σx both are unknown for most practical cases, we
predict the limiting values of the reference range using the tdistribution. The (1 − α)100% confidence interval (CI) [also
referred to as the prediction interval (PI)] is then computed for
(n − 1) degrees of freedom. The equations for estimating the
values of Θlc and Θu c are given below


× sx × tα ,n −1
Θlc = x̄ −

× sx × tα ,n −1 .
