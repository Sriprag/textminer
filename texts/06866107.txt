Abstract—Artificial intelligence and decision support systems offer a plethora of health monitoring capabilities in ambient assisted
living environment. Continuous assessment of health indicators for
elderly people living on their own is of utmost importance, so as
to prolong their independence and quality of life. Slow varying,
long-term deteriorating health trends are not easily identifiable in
seniors. Thus, early sign detection of a specific condition, as well
as, any likely transition from a healthy state to a pathological one
are key problems that the herein proposed framework aims at resolving. Statistical process control concepts offer a personalized
approach toward identification of trends that are away from the
atypical behavior or state of the seniors, while fuzzy cognitive maps
knowledge representation and inference schema have proved to be
efficient in terms of disease classification. Geriatric depression is
used as a case study throughout the paper, so to prove the validity
of the framework, which is planned to be pilot tested with a series
of lone-living seniors in their own homes.
Index Terms—Data-driven Hebbian learning (DD-NHL), decision support systems (DSSs), fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs), personalized health, statistical process control.

I. INTRODUCTION
URING the last few decades, senior population and life expectancy have been increasing constantly, thereby posing
the need for preservation of autonomous living for longer periods of time [1]. Ambient-assisted living (AAL) technologies
have become a contemporary trend towards the promotion of
independent living among the elderly and the disabled [2]. Numerous services have been proposed [3] as part of AAL research
and pilot projects, such as: health monitoring and detection of
health abnormalities [4], [5], emergency alerting [6], [7], early
prognosis of chronic conditions [8]–[11], and enablement of
actions in order to alleviate or prevent disease symptoms [12].
Wearable biosensor systems have been introduced in literature as multiparametric health-monitoring platforms (for a

review, see [13]). These approaches offer both accurate recording and real-time processing capabilities towards the early
detection of pathological patterns and medical decision-making.
Despite, the promising results obtained so far, they have not yet
provided a fully unobtrusive methodology convenient enough
for seniors [14].
The USEFIL project [15] aims at the promotion of “independent living” and “aging well in place” concepts, while respecting
the privacy feeling of the seniors, applying unobtrusive technology to remotely health monitoring. Low-level features extracted
from the raw sensory data are fused within a data fusion component, in order to provide contextualized information in the form
of high level events [16]. The term “events” is used for either
measurement-like observations (e.g., a heart rate measurement)
or fact-like observations (e.g., the person went to sleep). System
monitoring is organized in three levels: the sensor-specific monitoring level, where events are associated with a specific sensor,
the short-term events monitoring level, providing information
about the user on a short-term basis (e.g., 1 day), and the longterm events monitoring level providing long-term information
as well as trends related to the monitored person, over weeks
or months. These three levels of events form a hierarchy, since
long-term events are detected based on short term events, while
short-term events are detected based on sensor-level monitoring events. In this respect, sensor-level monitoring events are
also referred as low-level events, while short-term events are
referred as high-level events. High-level events along with electronic health records are regarded as inputs to an intelligent
processing module, namely the decision support system (DSS),
which supports several medical decision making tasks, such as
monitor health assessment indicators on an ongoing basis, diagnosis support and risk assessment. The whole information flow
within the USEFIL system is depicted in Fig. 1.
A. Paper Outline
The paper is structured as follows. First, Section II describes
how the current work goes beyond the literature’s baseline in
terms of tele-health monitoring methods. Subsequently, a short
overview of the framework’s composition and the components’
interactions is presented in Section III. Furthermore, in Section IV, we provide the main algorithms employed for the trend
analysis, the decision support for diagnosis, and the health risk
prediction problems. Those methodologies are demonstrated
through the geriatric depression scenario. More specifically, depressive symptoms, such as sleep problems (insomnia) are explored, identification of depression early existence is facilitated,
and disease progression is examined. Finally, risk prediction for

depression is employed. This way, we present the multifaceted
approach of the framework towards the health monitoring of
seniors at any stage.
After Section IV, a description of the datasets used for the
evaluation of the proposed framework is provided in Section V.
Several artificial scenarios were developed, which simulate:
1) sleep patterns, based on the total amount of sleep seniors
get on a daily basis, 2) healthy and depressive-prone elderly
profiles, based on risk factors and clinical symptomatology.
Finally, Section VII puts the threads together by shedding
light on the conducted simulations/experiments and their corresponding results, along with research limitations and further
envisaged work.
II. RELATED WORK
Before going any further, we deem it is important to emphasize how each of the components presented in this paper goes
beyond the state of the art.
A. Long-Term Analysis—Beyond State-of-the-Art
The majority of already developed decision-support systems
mainly focus on the detection of chronic conditions that affect senior citizens [17], [18]. Apart from providing signs of
already occurred pathological patterns, the USEFIL DSS approach also includes a trend analysis component. The reason
that motivated the design of such a system is to provide not only
reactive approaches in case of a life threatening situation (e.g.,
heart disease), but to detect pathological signs such as deteriorating trends of sleep quality. On the other hand, identification
of trends may be useful to reject outliers due to sensor noise and
to recognize potential health risks based on deteriorating health
trends. So, long-term analysis may be of particular importance
in case of slow varying pathological phenomena with preclinical phases of long duration such as cognitive decline and loss of
autonomous functioning [19]. Our trend analysis component is

DSS components and their interconnection.

inspired by statistical process control techniques for estimating
trends, which makes it quite novel. Unlike other approaches that
estimate trends in the form of time series [19], [20] the proposed
approach constructs confidence intervals defined by lower/upper
limits and mean values. Confidence intervals allow the system
to detect short-time windows that deviate from these intervals
due to acute events or sensor artifacts/outliers. This approach
facilitates both the detection of emergency alerts as well as the
system’s temporal failure in case of technical problems.
B. Decision Support—Beyond State-of-the-Art
Most of the previous decision support studies have shown that
probabilistic networks, cognitive approaches, and fuzzy-logicbased methodologies may be used for medical decision making
[21]. Apart from providing decisions regarding mainly diagnosis
and treatment suggestions, the probabilistic and cognitive processes seem to be able to cope with inherent uncertainty and a
priori knowledge; however, they require enough knowledge acquisition time and huge expert effort. The herein proposed fuzzy
cognitive map (FCM)-based methodologies and algorithms for
medical decision making and classification, go beyond the state
of the art, since: they facilitate doctors’ decision making and act
as a proactive and reactive mechanism against health risks.
In the case of classification, unsupervised data-driven
nonlinear Hebbian (DD-NHL) algorithm was used for FCM
learning using both experts’ knowledge and historical data. In
comparison to other machine learning approaches, DD-NHL
algorithm exhibits the following advantages: they demand less
computational effort, they are less time consuming, and provide
promising performance even in cases with small number of
instances [22].
III. DSS COMPONENTS
The heterogeneity of the decision tasks for which the USEFIL
DSS is responsible, poses the need for a modular architecture.
Each component must process a different kind of information
and needs to transform its inputs to higher level information
so as for it to be exploitable and comprehensible by health
practitioners. As shown in Fig. 2, the main DSS components are
the following: 1) trend analysis, 2) decision support core, and
3) risk prediction and assessment.

BILLIS et al.: DECISION-SUPPORT FRAMEWORK FOR PROMOTING INDEPENDENT LIVING AND AGEING WELL

The sensor data fusion component is not part of the DSS,
but it serves as an intermediate processing layer between sensor
processing components and the DSS. Its main scope is to provide
a contextual understanding of the user’s current activities, and
actions in the short-term based on low-level events.
The first DSS component is the trend analysis component—
inputs the sensor data fusion information, extracts the senior’s
baseline profile, and identifies long-term trends. This would
result to the annotation of the corresponding symptoms, which
subsequently serves as input to the second component (decision
support core). Based on the output of the second component
and a number of risk factors, the risk prediction and assessment
component provides an estimation of health risk. This estimation
is quantified into three levels (low/medium/high) and aims at the
treatment personalization by recognizing seniors who are at high
risk.
Outputs from the first layer (passive health monitoring) characterize the current health status of the senior (physical health,
mental, or emotional status), derived from previous DSS components such as the risk prediction and assessment component,
whereas the second level of the DSS system (reactive selftreatment) may correlate outputs from the first layer and predefined lifestyle profiles, based on well-defined medical knowledge. This layer is expected to interconnect the various DSS
subcomponents and their alerts in order to combine their decisions towards the formation of integrated information regarding
the user’s clinical, social, cognitive, and emotional status [23].
However, lifestyle modifications component has not been yet
fully implemented and therefore will not be described in the
next sections. Still, we add it in DSS schematic diagram for
better clarity of the framework’s holistic approach.

2) The baseline profile is consisted of a confidence interval for both the process mean value and the standard
deviation. These intervals are defined by the following
limits:
3r̂
limlow = x̂ − √
n
3r̂
limupp er = x̂ + √ .
n

(2)

The aforementioned computations result in a personalized
baseline profile.
2) Acute Event Detection: Ongoing monitoring of the process under consideration is facilitated through the comparison
with the baseline characteristics, and hence, the detection of
acute, short-time deviations from the interval defined in the previous step.
3) Long-Term Trend Analysis: Apart from the detection of
temporal indicators, long-term monitoring is facilitated by computing the slope of the trend, through the cumulative sum formula. A process is identified, where each run’s mean is subtracted by the mean of the baseline process, and subsequently, it
is cumulatively summed with previous calculated differences:
Si = Si−1 + (xi − x̂).

(3)

4) Identification of Sleep Problems: The trend analysis component is demonstrated through the study of daily sleep duration.
The proposed methodology involves the formation of a personalized sleep pattern profile during baseline through the adoption
of basic concepts derived from statistical process control. Subsequently, short-term deviations from this profile are identified
(indicative of significant and acute abnormal sleep events that
should be brought into the practitioner’s attention or may indicate noise outliers that should be rejected), while long-term
trends are investigated through the cumulative sum approach.

A. Long-Term Analysis—Trend Analysis
Identification of trends regarding physiological parameters is
based on statistical process control, since each variable under investigation is modeled as a random process with a time-varying
mean value and standard deviation. The basic approach is defined by the following steps:
1) Baseline Extraction: The first step towards trend identification is the estimation of a baseline profile through time-series
analysis and statistical process control concepts. More specifically, each variable under investigation (e.g., sleeping profile)
is modeled as a time-series random process with a time-varying
mean value and standard deviation [24]. The computations involved are the following:
1) Time-series observations are divided into n overlapping
windows. The mean (x̄) and the standard deviation (r̄) of
each time window are computed. Then, the mean value
and the standard deviation of the entire process are computed as follows:
x̂ = mean{x̄}
r̂ = mean{r̄}.

B. Decision Support Core Component for Diagnosis
1) FCMs for Decision Support: FCM is a directed fuzzy
signed graph capable of dealing with situations, including uncertain descriptions using similar procedure such as human reasoning does [25], [26]. It consists of nodes/concepts and weighted
edges between them. The concepts of the FCM are used to describe the behavior of the system and the signed and weighted
interconnections to represent the causal relationships that exist
between the concepts. The fuzzy part allows us to have degrees of causality, represented as links between the concepts of
these graphs [27].
The construction of an FCM for the modeling of a medical
decision making task requires the input of human experience
and knowledge of the system under consideration [28], [29].
Once the FCM is constructed, it can receive data from its input
concepts, perform reasoning, and infer medical decisions as
values of its output concepts. The steps of the FCM model
construction and FCM reasoning for medical decision making
are described analytically in [28] and [30].

FCM model for depression diagnosis.

geriatric depression was presented at [31]. A revised model has
been developed—concepts were limited only to the set relevant
to clinical guidelines (DSM IV)—thus resulting into the following knowledge representation scheme, depicted in Fig. 3. This
model consists of 14 concepts: C1: Psychomotor Agitation, C2:
Psychomotor Retardation, C3: Depressive Mood, C4: Reduced
Interest for Daily Functioning, C5: Insomnia, C6: Hypersomnia,
C7:Fatigue or Loss of Energy, C8: Recurrent Thoughts of Death,
C9: Loss of Appetite,C10: Diminished Ability to Think or Concentrate, C11: Indecisiveness, C12: Feelings of Worthlessness,
C13: Extreme Self-Criticism, and C14: Depression (Decision
concept).
Each concept is represented by a binary state, defining either
the presence or the absence of the concept. The weights of
the proposed model are calculated based on input provided by

experts and following the methodology described in [31]. The
final weight matrix is shown in Table I.
3) FCM Approach for Depression Severity: In the case of
determining depression severity, a new dynamic FCM model
was developed in order to assess the dynamic nature of the
different input fuzzy states of concepts and the different fuzzy
relationships between the fuzzy states of concepts.
The development of the dynamic FCM was accomplished
through two distinct stages. First, the dynamic FCM was developed as a classic FCM where concepts and causal relationships
were identified (check previous section). The concepts can be
variables and/or control states. However, the concepts are defined as fuzzy states, taking fuzzy values as inputs. According
to these concept states, different fuzzy interrelations exist.
Thus, in order to cope with this fuzzy task and to handle the
inherent uncertainty, additional modeling steps were introduced.
The dynamic FCM consists, with the exceptions of the concepts
and weights, of a weight selection point, and a selection base.
The weight selection point gathers all the fuzzy weights and
selects only those weights that correspond to the fuzzy input, as
determined by trend analysis. The selection base is responsible
for the tuning of the fuzzy weights, according to the fuzzy input
of each concept, and the production of the final weight matrix
used for FCM inference.
The depression severity is based on the same concepts already
described for the depression diagnosis task.
The decision/output concept of the readjusted FCM is the depression severity. The latter is assigned one of the three states of
mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the fuzzy degree of input concepts.The nonlinear relationships that exist between the
concepts and especially between the input concepts and severity of depression, can be efficiently coped with the proposed
dynamic FCM approach. An example of the proposed dynamic
FCM model consisting of five concepts is illustrated in Fig. 4.
As it can be observed from Fig. 4, each one of the four input
concepts has a connection with the weight selection point (Ws),
which gathers all the fuzzy weights from the related fuzzy inputs/concepts. The weight selection point provides all the fuzzy
relationships between the concepts and the selection base. In
this case, the Ws include all the fuzzy relationships between

BILLIS et al.: DECISION-SUPPORT FRAMEWORK FOR PROMOTING INDEPENDENT LIVING AND AGEING WELL

Dynamic FCM model for depression severity.

the concepts. Next, the selection base, which is responsible for
tuning the fuzzy weights according to the fuzzy input of each
concept and the depression output, selects only those weights
that correspond to the initially determined fuzzy value of the
input concept. For example, if the initial fuzzy state of the agitation concept is “medium”, then the selected fuzzy weights are:
“low” for emotional status, “low” for reduced interest of daily
functioning, and “very high” for Mild state of depression severity. The fuzzy value/state of each input concept is determined
by trend analysis. Thus, the selection base produces the final
weight matrix used for FCM inference. Therefore, the proposed
dynamic FCM is able to efficiently model these interrelationships and make inference of the depression severity degree.
C. DSS Component for Risk Prediction and Assessment
For classification reasons, in order to define for each patient
case a category of disease or a level of risk, a classification
algorithm based on FCM learning was implemented [32]. The
proposed classification algorithm is based on the performance
of the DD-NHL, algorithm previously used for autism classification [33]. In our approach, the main steps of the DD-NHL
algorithm were used for both learning and testing. We considered 70% of the patient cases to be used for training and 30% for
testing, with a random selection of these cases for training and
testing at each algorithm performance. During each algorithm
run/experiment, the classification accuracy is calculated by the
testing cases. The overall classification accuracy is estimated
by the mean value of the calculated classification accuracies
produced after a large number of experiments.
Summarizing, the proposed classification algorithm consists
of the following input and learning and testing phases which are
mainly based on the steps of DD-NHL.
Input: For a system with N concepts and K data points, the
input data form a matrix D = [dti], where dti corresponds to
the value of i-th concept (i = 1, . . . , N) at the t-th pattern,
where t = 1, . . . , K (K is the number of records), with size

203

K × N, which is called input data matrix. Each row of the given
matrix, illustrated as A(t) = [A1(t), A2(t), . . . , An(t)] where
t = 1, . . . , K, stores values of activations of the concepts at the
t-th iteration.
In the learning phase, the algorithm has to determine the decision boundaries that partition the underlying output vector from
step one into three sets, one for each class. For this purpose,
one-dimensional decision boundaries were determined by using the minimum Euclidean distance method [34]. Next, in the
testing phase, the remaining 30% of the patient cases following
the steps of the DD-NHL were classified using the previously
produced decision boundaries at each experiment were used to
estimate the classification accuracy.
Thus, for a total number of M experiments (in our case,
M = 100), the mean classifier accuracy was estimated.
1) Risk Assessment of Geriatric Depression: In order to define for each patient case a level of depression, the classification
approach for FCM learning is implemented. Before implementation of the classification algorithm, the FCM model concerning
the risk of depression must be developed. For the problem of
risk of depression, 26 input concepts (representing the factors
of risk of depression) and one output concept concerning the
category of depression (low, medium, high) were considered.
These 26 input factors defining the concepts of the FCM risk of
depression model are as follows:
C1-Education, C2-Idiosyncratically factors, C3-Recent bereavement C4-Polypharmacy, C5-Chronic stress caused by declining health, family, or marital problems, C6-Major physical
and chronic disabling illnesses/Chronic disease, C7-Stopping
driving, C8-Excessive alcohol use, C9-Care giving responsibilities for person with a major disease (e.g., dementia), C10-Sexual
problems, C11-Adverse drug effects, C12-Hormonal problems,
C13-Persistent sleep difficulties, C14- Reduced Mobility –Falls,
C15-Social disadvantage and low social support, C16-Marital
status, C17-Feelings of Worthlessness, C18-Fear of death, C19Financial problems, C20-Family health problems, C21-Previous
depression, C22-Adverse life events (e.g. loss, divorce), C23Cognitive impairment, C24-Change of self-image/perceived aspect of well being, C25-Retirement, and C26-Religious Beliefs.
Again, following the FCM construction process as described
previously (in Section IV-B), an FCM model for risk of depression was constructed. The model consists of 124 weighted
interconnections among concepts which were defined by experts’ suggestions. These weighted interconnections constitute
the initial weight matrix of the FCM model used in the DD-NHL
learning process.
After the FCM learning approach, where the output for each
one patient case is calculated, the algorithm must decide on the
decision boundaries that partition the underlying output vector
into three sets, one for each class. For this purpose, the minimum
Euclidean distance method was used [34].

data taking into account up-to-date literature and experts’ opinion. The following subsections present a brief overview of the
synthetic data provided for testing and the experimentation that
will lead to the results of this research (see Table II).
1) Sleep Profile: The trend analysis framework was validated by monitoring both short- and long-term alterations
of the sleeping hours. Our aim was to detect deterioration/improvement patterns. Therefore, the initial test data represented sleeping profiles which correspond to insomnia, hypersomnia, and normal sleeping profiles. Our simulation analysis
included 100 instances. The baseline period is divided into a
number of overlapping windows (N = 30). Each window size
was set at n = 3 days and the overlapping ratio is 2/3. This resulted to a total duration of 32 days. Twenty five (25) additional
time windows of the same size (n = 3 days) were available in
order to examine acute changes and trends away from baseline.
We tested the algorithm with various synthetic instances as
visualized in Fig. 5. The instances were simulated as either normally distributed processes with fixed mean value and standard
deviation or demonstrating increase/decrease patterns contaminated with noise modeled as Gaussian processes. Indicative
cases are visualized in the following figure (left column) as well
as with the mean process interval (right column).
2) Emotional Status: In order to build synthetic scenarios,
we consulted two experts, who provided us with the parameters’

values (14 concepts as described) and certain rules that apply to
geriatric depression symptomatology and diagnosis.
Diagnosis of depression requires existence of at least five
symptoms (concepts), including depressive mood and diminished ability of daily living. Extra care was taken regarding
the relationship that exists among several symptoms. For example, insomnia/hypersomnia and agitation/retardation concepts
are mutually occlusive, since a senior citizen may suffer either
from insomnia or hypersomnia and similarly his psychomotor
status could be regarded either as agitated or as retarded. On the
other hand, he or she may suffer simultaneously from feelings
of worthlessness and extreme self-criticism or from diminished
ability to think/concentrate and indecisiveness. Therefore, the
logical relationship regarding the former set of symptoms is the
logical XOR while for the latter sets of concepts the logical
OR.
At the experimentation stage, we aimed at building scenarios reflecting as much as possible real data. Therefore, a serious amount of synthetic emotional profiles were developed and
annotated by experts (340 depressive and 176 normal cases).
Moreover, case homogeneity among marginal and extreme scenarios ensures that the system is able to recognize both “easy”
and “difficult” instances of depression symptomatology with the
same sensitivity.
3) Severity of Geriatric Depression: Depression severity
scenarios were also constructed as part of the tests for the DSS.
Specifically, the system tries to perceive the exact inputs and
detect depression severity through scenarios identification. The
scope of artificial scenarios development is to enable the algorithm to decide whether the patient’s symptoms, by giving
their number and frequency levels (expressed in three fuzzy levels of intensity (low/medium/high)), can evaluate depression’s
severity (mild/moderate or severe level).
According to experts, inputs which lead to severe depression are those where the majority of symptoms have moderate
or severe intensity and frequency, while the analogous scenarios for mild depression included fewer symptoms with mild
or moderate intensity and frequency. Sixty three (63) cases
were developed and annotated based on the aforementioned
assumptions.
4) Risk Prediction of Geriatric Depression: In order to develop artificial scenarios based on real clinical cases, experts

combined the risk factors addressed in Section IV-C. Taking
into account the differences between risk factors, such as their
importance expressed in terms of weighted contribution, their
number, and clinical experience, we were able to create one
hundred (100) scenarios.
VI. RESULTS
A. Identification of Geriatric Depression Symptomatology
1) Baseline Profile Extraction: The proposed algorithm was
used to first estimate the baseline characteristics (mean value
and confidence intervals). Aiming to test our system with realistic scenarios, we modeled baseline instances to be nonstationary
time-series with underlying dynamics dependent from time variations. The latter was visualized in the last (third) row of Fig. 5,
which was consisted of an initial relatively stable period, which
was followed by a decline in sleep duration, while the last part
is characterized by an increase.
2) Acute Event Detection: Once the participant’s sleep profile has been estimated, the acute event detection procedure is
performed by comparing the current window’s temporal characteristics with the baseline profile in terms of the confidence
interval. As an example, let us regard the third baseline period
(plotted in black). Its baseline mean value is 290.3057 and the
confidence interval for the mean value is [279.8104–300.8009].
Let us assume now that the current temporal window demonstrates a mean value of 250. This triggers an acute event notification indicative of a sudden sleep duration decrease.
3) Trend Identification: Analysis of long-term trends is performed through the cumulative sum formula as described in
Section IV. This analysis enables us to identify slow varying
trends even in the presence of noise, outliers, and acute events.
Let us consider the following example: a stable condition modeled with mean value 280 h and standard deviation 15 h. In our
first case (see Fig. 6; first row), this baseline period was followed
by a sudden decrease (acute event) and a stable period with low
variability and lower mean value.
The resulted time-series is visualized in the left column (blue
color). The underlying trend is visualized in the right column
(blue color). The medical expert could observe this sudden decrease and stabilization to a lower mean value by the descending

slope. The second row visualizes the same baseline period followed by a gradual increase in sleep duration. This increase is
depicted as a long-term increase in the second part of the cumulative sum graph (second row; right Column). Finally, the
third row represents a profile with several fluctuations through
time. As depicted in the cumulative sum graph (third row; right
column), there is an initial decreasing trend followed by an
increasing one and resulting to a stable, final state.
B. Identification of Early Depressive Signs
More specifically, we validated our FCM system under three
different circumstances, see Table III. First, we tested the system with a priori knowledge regarding the patients’ health
status—depressed for the depressed cases and healthy for the
healthy cases. The results seem to be consistent with the expert’s knowledge and guidelines, and give the model’s accuracy
to be 95.15%. Second, we set the initial conditions to correspond to the borderline (C14 = 0.5) and the system’s accuracy
was restricted to 88.37% (457/517), since it failed to recognize
60 depressive cases. In a similar way, (transition case), we set
the initial healthy conditions to be pathological and the initial
pathological conditions to be healthy. Despite the misleading
conditions, the system’s accuracy was satisfactory (76.93%).
C. Identification of Geriatric Depression Severity
Sixty three cases were built, following the principles described in the section on depression severity scenarios description. These cases served as the basis for the validation of the
developed FCM-based depression severity system. Based on scientific guidelines [35], two neuropsychologists annotated these
patient cases into three categories, respectively mild, moderate,
and severe depression. Two experiments were conducted in order to determine the accuracy of the FCM methodology. Mild
and moderate states were grouped together, since it is too difficult even for the experts to distinguish between the two. In
the first experiment, we included cases where either a stable
status or a worsening one was hypothesized. Table IV shows the
distribution of these types of cases (Prior Health Status → Current Health Status) and the accuracy of the FCM model. Fig. 7

In the second experiment, we created more challenging transition cases, which also represented improvement of the senior’s
emotional status. Table V shows the distribution of these types
of cases (Prior Health Status → Current Health Status) and the
accuracy of the FCM model. Fig. 8 shows a decision threshold

boundaries, a lower (left vertical line) and an upper one (right vertical line).
Cases that fall within the left region are classified as low risk cases. Subsequently,
cases that fall within the middle area and cases that fall within the right area are
classified as medium or high risk cases respectively.

D. Risk Prediction of Geriatric Depression
One hundred (100) scenario-patient cases with low, medium,
and high risk of depression were assembled from questionnaires.
Using the classification approach of the FCM–DD-NHL learning algorithm, we classified these cases into three categories,
considering the learning and testing phases. To estimate the
classifier accuracy, 30 cases selected randomly from the initially 100 cases were used for testing, whereas the remaining
ones were used for FCM learning. The algorithm performance
was evaluated by considering 100 experiments.
At each experiment, 70% of cases were used for learning
and 30% for testing randomly selected. The mean value of the
classification accuracy was estimated to 78.66%.

Fig. 9 is an indicative experiment run for 30 cases selected
randomly from the initial dataset.
Apart from the classification accuracy, precision and recall
were calculated for each class (low, medium and high risk) (see
Table VI).
VII. DISCUSSION
This piece of research study aimed at presenting a first attempt to develop a modular decision support framework for the
promotion of independent living and aging well. Three main
components compose the proposed framework: trend analysis,
decision support core, and risk prediction and assessment.

The trend analysis component aimed at estimating both the
short-term events and long-term conditions in order to provide decisions regarding the chronic conditions affecting the
elderly (e.g., cognitive impairment, loss of functional ability,
depression, etc.). More specifically, this part of the DSS provides answers to the following questions:
1) How could daily observations be mapped into slow varying trends that may hide gradual health deterioration?
2) Could one detect transition patterns indicative of future
deterioration prior to the symptoms’ appearance?
3) Could one estimate chronic alterations in the presence of
outliers that may be either due to system failure or due to
acute events?
A personalized approach was adopted to face the inherent
variability of physiological data. Despite the establishment of
generically accepted and well-documented cutoff values for detecting insomnia or hypersomnia, these may vary in each participant. Therefore, it is very important to detect alterations in
the light of a personalized sleep model.
Detection of acute events is an extensively studied topic and
especially valuable in the case of conditions that endanger the
life of senior citizens. However, transient deviations from the
developed baseline sleep model may also be due to noise/sensor
outliers or due to environmental conditions. These parameters
greatly affect the system’s behavior and may supersede real
trends, and thus need to be identified and further studied.
The baseline itself may be characterized by underlying dynamics. Moreover, pathology may exist during baseline in case
of recruiting participants suffering, e.g., from chronic insomnia.
Therefore, the baseline situation is also detected and annotated.
The novelty of the proposed approach is that it does not annotate
forthcoming changes in terms of group-defined thresholds but
is based on individual values. For example, a senior citizen may
still suffer from insomnia but its condition may be improved
regarding the baseline period. So, our main focus is to detect alterations relative to baseline. Therefore, special attention should
be given at the definition of the baseline period. The baseline
interval should be defined taking into consideration two facts: 1)
avoid influence from transient, fast-varying events (e.g., sensor
noise, acute events) and, 1) slow-varying, seasonal effects (e.g.,
normal decrease in sleep duration due to summer) that may also
influence the baseline calculations.
Identifying that a senior has a specific condition, e.g., geriatric
depression, is of great significance since this allows certain therapeutic measures to be taken and triggers constant monitoring
of the disease evolution. Given the presence of a disease’s symptomatology, the DSS should quantify the extent of the disease
and alert the carer by identifying transitions of health state.

207

The decision support core components have been developed
to estimate current health states. Comparison with previous
health states is also performed to examine transitions and to
monitor the disease progression. Through timely assessment
and identification of such transitions, the component is able to
generate alerts for the carer. The results, which were evaluated
by our experts (neuropsychologists), demonstrate that the system works satisfactory in the sense that a high level of accuracy
is achieved.
A modified version of the FCM-based depression diagnosis schema was also introduced, where a dynamic selection
process intervenes in order to form the final weight matrix.
Experiments were conducted, keeping in mind that the primary
goal is to achieve accurate transition state findings. Results from
both experiments (stable condition or deteriorating) suggest that
the proposed methodology has a satisfactory accuracy in cases
where either the emotional status of the person remains stable
or is deteriorating
Finally, an FCM-DDNHL approach has been adopted in order
to train the FCM model towards predicting and assessing future
health risks, e.g., depression. Mild/moderate cases that were
wrongly classified as severe refer to simulated cases where there
was an improvement of depression severity. Although, modeling
of such transition type among severity states fails to offer even
fair reliability, it is of little interest to the doctors, as it represents
pretty rare cases and furthermore do not reflect actual patient
cases. The rest cases showed pretty accurate results.
The results of all the algorithms used within the proposed
framework are promising and suggest that our approach will
detect elders either suffering from depressive systems or being at
high risk of doing so in the future. Of course, further testing with
real-life clinical cases is needed to further confirm this result.
A. Limitations and Future Work
The entire DSS system and its algorithms are based on scenarios developed by experts involved in the USEFIL project.
Currently, in this project, there exist no real (senior) sensor
data as pilots have not been deployed yet. However, the plan is
that over the next few months all system components are integrated together and complete system setups become available
for installation in seniors’ homes. This unavailability of real
data drove the motivation to initiate the production of synthetic
scenarios for DSS training and validation (i.e., pseudo-data).
The main goal of this phase is to simulate real cases towards
algorithmic development and testing. Their performance was
hypothesized to remain high when processing either simulated
or real data by employing an exhaustive search for patterns that
are likely (frequently or rarely) to occur during the pilots.
However, it is important to highlight issues that may limit the
DSS performance during the pilot phase. These are the variations (artifacts, outliers, sensor malfunction, missing data) that
may occur. All these parameters, superimposed on the inherent complexity of human behavior, increase the variability of
the data obtained. Aiming to deal with this problem, synthetic
patterns were contaminated with noise, which was modeled as
a Gaussian statistical process with varying mean values and

208

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. 19, NO. 1, JANUARY 2015

standard deviations. In addition to the “filtering” taking place
during the data fusion process, training the algorithms with a
varying degree of noise is expected to enhance the system’s
robustness. Finally, there is the case of the temporal lack of
sensors due to malfunction or bad use of the equipment. This
situation is highly possible to occur and should be considered
during the system development. Alternative approaches can be
adopted in order to deal with this situation: the DSS can identify, based on previously obtained data, the system’s behavior
in terms of its dominant pattern and its dynamics. Then, a data
imputation method may take place, similar to the ones reported
in [36].
Another issue has to do with the approach followed within the
trend analysis component. More specifically, the methodology
developed, calculates trends based only to a single parameter.
However, most symptoms in the elderly are much more complex and rely to multifactorial information [37]. For example,
insomnia/hypersomnia incidents may be characterized in terms
of several parameters such as sleep duration, sleep latency, sleep
efficiency, increased awakening after sleep onset, multiple longwake, etc.). In order to extend the proposed analysis, we aim
to follow certain steps: the single variable (sleep duration time
series) would be extended by a multivariate feature vector which
would be consisted of N1 features (sleep duration, latency, number of sleep intervals) and N2 instances.
Then, (1) and (2) described in Section IV-A are performed
among vectors and not single variables. Instead of standard
deviation, a radius value is defined as parameter and distances
among feature vectors are then computed.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, it is our belief that the proposed decision support framework has the capacity to accurately evaluate the progression of the seniors’ depressive symptoms and to alert carers,
by providing them with useful information for adjusting the patients’ treatment accordingly.
Evaluation of the proposed methodology showed that our approach has a sufficient potential which may be further exploited
to identify health risks and to classify seniors into different categories according to their risk levels of becoming diseased. We
have already partially applied the proposed framework to other
health aspects of the seniors, e.g., activities of daily living monitoring and identification of neurocognitive disease. Still, we
expect to gather data from pilots that should start in the near
future. Therefore, we will have the opportunity to test the proposed framework under real-life settings and evaluate them in
terms of seniors’ quality of life enhancement.
