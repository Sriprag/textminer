Abstract—Control scheme design based on surface electromyography (sEMG) pattern recognition has been the focus of much
research on a myoelectric prosthesis (MP) technology. Due to inherent nonstationarity in sEMG signals, prosthesis systems may
need to be recalibrated day after day in daily use applications;
thereby, hindering MP usability. In order to reduce the recalibration time in the subsequent days following the initial training,
we propose a domain adaptation (DA) framework, which automatically reuses the models trained in earlier days as input for
two baseline classifiers: a polynomial classifier (PC) and a linear
discriminant analysis (LDA). Two novel algorithms of DA are introduced, one for PC and the other one for LDA. Five intact-limbed
subjects and two transradial-amputee subjects participated in an
experiment lasting ten days, to simulate the application of a MP
over multiple days. The experiment results of four methods were
compared: PC-DA (PC with DA), PC-BL (baseline PC), LDA-DA
(LDA with DA), and LDA-BL (baseline LDA). In a new day, the DA
methods reuse nine pretrained models, which were calibrated by
40 s training data per class in nine previous days. We show that the
proposed DA methods significantly outperform nonadaptive baseline methods. The improvement in classification accuracy ranges
from 5.49% to 28.48%, when the recording time per class is 2 s. For
example, the average classification rates of PC-BL and PC-DA are
83.70% and 92.99%, respectively, for intact-limbed subjects with
a nine-motions classification task. These results indicate that DA
has the potential to improve the usability of MPs based on pattern
recognition, by reducing the calibration time.

I. INTRODUCTION
YOELECTRIC prosthesis (MP) has existed for approximately 60 years, but user acceptance remains low [1].
Lack of control has been reported as one of the primary deficiencies in usability [2]. The controllable degrees of freedom
(DOFs) of MPs in the clinical setting continue to be limited.
This limitation is essentially attributed to the control strategies

implemented in the MPs, strategies which have not changed
significantly since their inception in the 1960s [3]. This type of
control strategy, called “conventional control” in many papers,
uses the amplitude of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals from a pair of muscles as controller input for one DOF of
prehension. If more DOFs were desired, the user needed to perform cocontraction to switch the MP mode [4]. Consequently,
such nonintuitive control strategies have been cumbersome to
the user, resulting in a high rate (≈75%) of device abandonment
[1], [5].
Pattern recognition technology has been reported to address
this usability limitation, to increase the clinical impact of MP
[2], [6]. This technique makes a natural mapping from users’
limb motion to analogous prostheses function by extracting and
classifying the features from multichannel sEMG signals. This
type of control strategy is more intuitive than the conventional
control strategy. Therefore, many studies have used this approach for MP. Efforts have been devoted to apply many algorithms to extract discriminative sEMG features and design effective classifiers. The most used feature extraction algorithms include: time-domain features, frequency-domain features, time–
frequency representation, nonlinear analysis, and high-order
statistics [6]–[11]. Common classifiers include: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), artificial neural networks, Gaussian mixture model, heuristic fuzzy logic approach, and support vector
machine (SVM) [12]–[16]. A number of powerful preprocessing
methods have also been used to further improve classification
performance [17]–[21]. These studies reported high recognition
accuracies, some above 90% with more than ten types of limb
movements (motion classes). Furthermore, a number of realtime experiments, often with amputee subjects to demonstrate
clinical relevance, have examined the possibility of practical
application of MP based on pattern recognition [22], [23].
In spite of these promising results, the reported studies usually required a significant amount of time to calibrate the classifier in order to achieve improved performance. Most previous
studies used either half of the total experiment data as a training set, and the other half as a testing set or cross-validation to
verify their proposed methods [7], [8], [12], [14], [15], [24]. Furthermore, the duration of the experiments is relatively short (a
few hours), compared with the practical usage of MPs (across
days, months, or years). It is well known that sEMG signals
might change their characteristics between MP donning and
doffing, changes mainly caused by electrode conductivity variations, electrophysiological changes, and electrode shift [25].
Such inherent nonstationarity leads to significant deterioration
of sEMG pattern recognition, as reported in [26]–[28]. To reduce

the adverse effect of these changes, the classifier must be recalibrated frequently, usually whenever the prosthesis is redonned
[25], [29], a process that is time consuming and inconvenient
in terms of usability. Therefore, the recalibration process is one
of the most significant factors that prevent MPs from reaching
their full clinical impact [30].
In spite of the intrinsic nonstationarity in sEMG signals across
multiple days, we hypothesize that there exist certain invariant
sEMG characteristics when the same motion is performed. Because, once the MP is custom built for one individual amputee,
the assumptions are that the number of electrodes used, the
muscles from which the sEMG signals will be acquired and the
motion classes needed to be recognized would, all three, remain
unchanged. Therefore, in prolonged usage of a MP for a single
amputee, the classifiers trained in the past days should continue
to contain useful information over time. Thus, we should be able
to reuse and integrate the classifiers built on previous day into
training process of the current day. This approach is referred
as domain adaptation (DA) [31], [32]. By this method, we expect to train the classifier faster than without integrating these
prior classifiers. Consequently, the recalibration process of MP
in later days should become much faster.
To test this hypothesis, we propose two DA algorithms working on a polynomial classifier (PC) and on a LDA. The PC
is a simple classifier that has comparable performance to the
more complex SVM classifier [33]. We derive for PC the closed
form of leave-one-out predictions for training data. Thanks to
the closed form obtained, the optimization algorithm for computing the learning rate of DA can be found in several seconds.
LDA is another simple classifier that has proven to be robust in
myoelectric pattern recognition [27]. Depending on the characteristics of the LDA parameters, we can compute the learning
rate with a simple metric, the Mahalanobis distance. The rest of
the paper is organized as follows. In Sections II-A and II-B, introduce the DA algorithms for both PC and LDA, respectively.
Sections II-C and II-D describe the experiment protocol and
signals processing procedure. Sections III and IV present and
discuss the results of the proposed methods. Finally, we draw
conclusions in Section V.
II. METHODS
Fig. 1 illustrates the data processing flowchart. The focus of
current study is the classification stage. In this section, we first
introduce the four classification methods including two novel
DA algorithms. We also describe the data acquisition protocol
and other data processing procedures.

novel methods proposed here.

where K is the polynomial order, e.g., for a 2-D input feature
vector, s = [x1 , x2 ]T with order 2 (i.e., K = 2), the polynomial
vector is given by
p(s) = [1, x1 , x2 , x21 , x1 x2 , x22 ]T .

The second step is model training with the least-square (LS)
criterion. Given N training feature vectors s1 , s2 , . . . , sN , the
polynomial expansion matrix M of the training data is defined
as

Y ∈ RN ×C represents the ideal output composed of the row
vector Yi , where for each sample si belonging to ci th class, the
vector Yi has all the components equal to zero except for the
ci th that is equal to one [33].
The optimization problem (4) can be solved by applying the
method of normal equations

A. DA of PC
1) Polynomial Classifier: The PC has been successfully
used for speech recognition [34], as the PC is simple and
highly accurate. Its effectiveness has also been demonstrated
by Al-Assaf [33] for sEMG pattern recognition. The training
process of the PC includes two steps. The first step is polynomial expansion. That is, the original input feature vector,
s = [x1 , x2 , . . . , xR ]T , is expanded as a polynomial vector p(s).

kj
The elements of p(s) are monomials of the form: R
j =1 xj ,

where M is the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of matrix M
[35]. Further, when the symmetric matrix M T M is nonsingular,
(5) could be rearranged by
W opt = (M T M )−1 M T Y.

(6)

In the testing stage, when an unknown feature vector s is
presented to the PC, the vector is expanded as its polynomial
vector p(s) and its class c is determined by
c = argmax p(s)T Wiopt
i=1,2,...,C

(7)

where Wiopt is the ith column of W opt .
The polynomial order K is the only hyperparameter needed
to be decided by the user in the PC. As reported in [33], 2 is a
favourable choice of K for sEMG pattern recognition.
2) DA Algorithm for PC: Assuming there are p pretrained

models {W
trained on data acquired from p different earlier days; then,
in the training process of the current day, we want to reduce the
calibration time by reusing these prior models. The framework
of this DA method can be formulated as

W and the adaptive model is represented as W = β k W

W , where β 1 to β k −1 have been computed from the first k1 steps. Therefore, we can obtain the optimal β k , similar to
(12), but as an univariate optimization problem. In this case,
the solution is not affected by the choice of initial value. At
each step, we use the gradient descent algorithm to accomplish
this optimization process. The entire optimization procedure is
summarized in Algorithm 1 (see Appendix B). Benefiting from
the closed formula in (10), the algorithm is guaranteed to quickly
converge.

where Q = M (M M ) M ; Yik is the output of the prior
 k on the ith training sample; Y i is the output of the
model W
current model on the ith training sample; and Yi is the ideal
output of the ith training sample. The derivation of the (10)
can be found in Appendix A. Given the closed form of leaveone-out prediction, we can solve it with almost negligible extra
computational time. This is because the complexity of the algorithm is dominated by computing the matrix Q, a matrix
which can be obtained in the stage of training the new model W
(Q = M M + ).
From (10), we can see that the leave-one-out prediction is
determined by the learning rate vector, β = [β 1 , β 2 , . . . , β p ].
Therefore, it is possible that the optimal β is simultaneously
obtained by minimizing the sum of the leave-one-out prediction
errors. Similar to [32] and [36], the leave-one-out prediction
error is represented by a loss function (Yi , Yi ), such that
T

β k ≥ 0.

It is, however, an optimization problem in p variables, which
may easily fall into a local minima, that depends on initial values. To make the optimization algorithm robust, we implement a
method to evaluate the best learning rate β k step-by-step rather
than simultaneously. The models of multiple prior days are reordered depending on their coincidence with current training
data, coincidence which is determined by

k =1

where W represents the new model estimated from the current
training data; β k is the learning rate and represents how much
 k is reused; and W represents the resulting
the prior model W
adaptive model.
We next decide how to determine the learning rate β k . A β k ,
which can generate an adaptive model with good generalization
ability is possibly a suitable choice. And, one of the common
metrics for generalization is the leave-one-out prediction error
[36]. Furthermore, we find it is possible to write the leaveone-out prediction in a closed formula for PC. When the ith
training sample is removed from the training set, the leave-oneout prediction of the DA model can be expressed as

N
1 
(Yi , Yi ),
N i=1

(11)

This function means that, for the ith training sample belonging to ci th class, the loss is zero when the ci th element of the
prediction output is larger than any other elements by at least
0.5. In contrast to [36] and [32], the bias is set as 0.5 rather than
1 because the ideal output Yi consists of 0 and 1 rather than
−1 and 1, overfitting may occur if the bias is too high. Once

1) Linear Discriminant Analysis: LDA is based on the
Bayesian decision rule and Gaussian assumption [37]. After
several manipulations, the discriminant function of LDA for a
measure x is defined as
1
gc (x) = μTc Σ−1 x − μTc Σ−1 μc + ln p(ωc )
2

(14)

where μc is the mean vector of the training samples of class
c, and p(ωc ) is the prior probability of class c. Σ is the pooled
sample covariance matrix, which is defined as
Σ=

C

nc − 1
Σc
N −C
c=1

(15)

where C is the number of classes, nc is the number of the
training samples of class c, N is the number of the total training
samples, and Σc is the sample covariance matrix of class c. The
class label of the x is determined by choosing the class c, which
produces the maximum discriminant function value. In sEMG
pattern recognition, the numbers of the training samples of all
classes generally are the same and the prior probabilities of all
classes are assumed to be equal. Therefore, the term ln p(ωc ) in
(14) can be omitted, and the pooled sample covariance matrix
Σ can be calculated as the equally weighted average of the
covariance matrices across all classes.

2) DA Algorithm for LDA: From the description in Section
II-B1, we know that the model of LDA for sEMG pattern recognition is determined by the parameters, mean vector, and covariance matrix of each class. Suppose there have been p pretrained models stored in memory, which are trained on data
acquired from p prior days. These models can be represented
 kc ), c = 1 : C; k = 1 : p. In the new day, we can inas (

tegrate these prior models into the training process due to their
consistence with the current data to some extent. The framework
of such integration method is formulated as

where μc and Σc are the mean vector and covariance matrix
of class c estimated on the incoming training samples of the
current day; ωck is the weight determining how much the model
of kth day can be reused for class c. From (16) and (17), we
see that the anticipated model is the combination of the current
model and the weighted sum of prior models through a tradeoff
parameter r.
Here, the weight ωck is computed as the inverse proportion to
the Mahalanobis distance from the centroid of current model to
that of kth prior model for class c. That is

means less consistence and results in less weight ωc .
For the tradeoff parameter r, we set to 0.5 based on previous

C. Data Acquisition
Five healthy intact-limbed subjects (all male) and two transradial amputee subjects (one male and one female) participated in
this experiment. The demographic data of the two amputee subjects is summarized in Table I. All subjects signed the informed

consent before the experiment. The experiment procedures conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki.
The experiment employed a commercial wireless biological
signal acquisition system, TrignoTM Wireless system (Delsys
INC, USA), to record the sEMG signals. The skin on the forearm was rubbed lightly with alcohol to provide good contact
for sEMG signals acquisition. For the intact-limbed subjects,
four wireless sEMG sensors with bipolar configuration were
placed on the extensor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi radialis, extensor carpi radialis longus, and flexor carpi ulnaris, respectively
[see Fig. 2(a), (b)]. These four muscles were chosen because
they are highly related to human wrist and hand motions. For
amputee subjects, because of the difficulty to identify the muscle position, six sEMG sensors were placed equidistantly around
the circumference of the stump [see Fig. 2(c), (d)]. After initial
calibration, the sensor positions were marked, so that on subsequent days, the electrodes could be placed, as much as possible
in the same positions.
The intact-limbed subjects were asked to perform actual hand
and wrist motions with the arm, where the sEMG sensors were
placed on. They performed 13 types of movements in the experiment, including wrist flexion (WF), wrist extension (WE), radial
deviation (RD), ulnar deviation (UD), pronation (P), supination
(S), hand close (HC), hand open (HO), fine pinch (FP), key grip
(KG), ball grasp (BG), cylinder grasp (CG), and “no motion”
(NM). The amputee subjects were instructed to produce muscle
contractions, while imagining a specific movement with their
phantom limb, at the same time they performed a mirror movement of the intact arm to facilitate the contraction of the affected
side. Because of the difficulty to perform BG and CG for the
amputee subjects, they only performed the other 11 types of
movements.
During the sEMG signals recording, the subject was instructed to perform a succession of movements with a moderate

170

level of effort. In one trial, each movement was sustained for
5 s, followed by 5 s of rest between movements to avoid fatigue.
Each subject performed 20 trials of data capture per session. The
time interval between sessions was approximately one day. The
entire experiment consisted of ten days to simulate a scenario
of MP used across multiple days.
The sEMG signals were band-pass filtered (20–450 Hz) and
sampled at 2 KHz. All data were stored and analyzed offline on
a 2.5-GHz Intel Core Quad CPU computer running MATLAB
(Mathworks, Inc.).
D. Feature Extraction and Classification
In one trial, the central 4 s part of each 5 s contraction data
were included in the analysis; thereby, removing the transient
state of the contraction. Afterward, the usable data were segmented into a series of 200-ms windows with 50% overlap.
The sEMG features were extracted in each window. The timedomain feature set containing mean absolute value, waveform
length, zero crossing, and slope sign changes was used [12];
hence, one sample in the classification stage was a feature
vector whose dimensionality was 16 (four sensors for intactlimbed subjects) or 24 (six sensors for amputee subjects). After
this preprocessing, in each trial 39 samples per motion class
[(4000 ms−200 ms + 100 ms)/100 ms = 39] were obtained;
that is, 780 samples per motion class (20 × 39 = 780) for one
subject were obtained in one day.
Testing was performed on ten days for each subject. Out
of these ten days, data from nine days (ten trials data in each
day) were used to train nine models offline, which were the
p pretrained models in (9) or (16). The remaining day was
regarded as the new (current) day. We repeated this process
ten times to obtain ten results similar to a tenfold cross-dayvalidation for each subject. The following two classification
tasks were investigated for the intact-limbed subjects.
(1) Task including 13 motion classes: WF, WE, RD, UD, P,
S, HC, HO, FP, KG, BG, CG, and NM.
(2) Task including nine motion classes: WF, WE, P, S, HC,
HO, FP, CG, and NM.
Two classification tasks were also investigated for the amputee subjects.
(1) Task including 11 motion classes: WF, WE, RD, UD, P,
S, HC, HO, FP, KG, and NM.
(2) Task including nine motion classes: WF, WE, P, S, HC,
HO, FP, KG, and NM.
In the new day, ten successive training steps were considered.
At the kth step, the number of available training samples per
class was 20 k, by which the classifier was built. The test was
implemented over all the remaining samples (780−20 k samples
per class). We used the classification accuracy averaged across
all motion classes as a measure of the classification performance.
The classification performances of the following four methods
were compared (see Fig. 1).
(1) PC-BL: The nonadaptive baseline method of PC; that is,
the prior knowledge models are not reused for PC.
(2) PC-DA: The DA method based on PC.
(3) LDA-BL: The nonadaptive baseline method of LDA.

method of PC; PC-DA represents DA based on PC; LDA-BL represents nonadaptive baseline method of LDA; LDA-DA represents DA based on LDA.
(a) Classification task including thirteen motion classes. (b) Classification task
including nine motion classes.

(4) LDA-DA: The DA method based on LDA.
At each training step, a statistical analysis was performed with
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The two factors are
subject and method (PC-BL, PC-DA, LDA-BL, and LDA-DA).
The purpose of this ANOVA test is to investigate whether there
is a significant difference in the classification performances of
the four methods. After the ANOVA, a Tukey HSD comparison
is performed. The significance level for all tests is set at 0.05.
III. RESULTS
A. Intact-Limbed Subjects
Fig. 3 reports the average classification accuracy as a function
of the number of training samples per class from the current
day. At each training step, the classification accuracy of one
curve is averaged across 50 results (five subjects, ten results
for each subject). We convert the x-axis from the number of
training samples into the recording time of training samples (20
samples correspond to 2 s). This gives a direct indication on how
much training time is used. The training time is approximately
double the recording time, considering the breaks between two
subsequent motions.
As a general comment, for both types of classifiers, the DA
method outperforms the baseline method. The advantages of the
adaptive models are evident especially when the training samples are small. The advantage gradually reduces as the number of
training samples increases. Fig. 3(a) represents the classification
task including 13 classes. PC-DA surpasses PC-BL in classification accuracy by 12.12% (84.47% versus 72.35%) when the
recording time is 2 s per class and by 8.02% when the recording

time is 4 s per class (86.32% versus 78.30%). LDA-DA improves by 7.67% (86.72% versus 79.05%) and 5.55% (87.93%
versus 82.38%) over the LDA-BL in these two training steps.
Fig. 3(b) represents the classification task including nine classes.
The results are similar to those in Fig. 3(a). PC-DA outperforms
PC-BL in classification rate by 9.29% when the recording time
per class is as short as 2 s. The gain in performance of LDA-DA
with respect to LDA-BL is 5.49% at this training step.
It is also worth noting that LDA-BL outperforms PC-BL
when the number of training samples is small [see the first
two training steps in Fig. 3(a), (b)]. Table II summarizes the
results of the statistical analysis. The rows with unbold symbols
indicate the results of task of 13 classes, while the rows with
gray background indicate the task of nine classes. We can see
that as the number of training samples increases, the pairwise
differences between methods gradually become smaller and fail
to show significance. At the first two training steps, which are the
points of interest in this study, the Tukey comparison shows that
LDA-DA = PC-DA > LDA-BL > PC-BL for both classification
tasks.

B. Amputee Subjects
The results from amputee subjects are similar to those from
intact-limbed subjects (see Fig. 4). The DA methods generally
outperform the baseline methods for both types of classifiers.
The superiority of the adaptation method is again clear when
the training data size is small. Fig. 4(a) indicates the task including 11 classes. The gains in classification rate of PC-DA
w.r.t. PC-BL are 28.48% (73.42% versus 44.93%) and 14.77%
(75.93% versus 61.16%) in the first two training steps. The accuracy gains of LDA-DA compared to LDA-BL are 10.30%
(82.88% verus 72.58%) and 10.25% (83.39% versus 73.14%)
in these two steps. Fig. 4(b) reports the results of classification
task containing nine classes. PC-DA outperforms PC-BL in accuracy gains of 23.28% (78.79% versus 55.51%) and 22.26%
(78.95% versus 56.69%) in the first two smallest training sizes.
The gains in accuracy of LDA-DA w.r.t. LDA-BL are 8.67%
(87.10% versus 78.43%) and 7.98% (87.38% versus 79.40%),
respectively, in these two cases.

Note that, for small training data sizes, the superiority of
LDA-BL over PC-BL is more pronounced for amputee subjects
than intact-limbed subjects, regardless of whether DA is used or
not. Table III summarizes the results of the statistical analysis
for amputee subjects. The rows with unbold symbols and with
gray background indicate the tasks containing eleven classes and
nine classes, respectively. As the training sample size increases,
the differences among methods fail to show significance (after
the fifth training step). At the first training step, the Tukey comparison shows that LDA-DA > PC-DA = LDA-BL > PC-BL
for both classification tasks, similar to the case of intact-limbed
subjects.

IV. DISCUSSION
A. Benefits of DA
The DA methods generally outperform the nonadaptive baseline methods for both PC and LDA, especially when the sample size used for training is small. In the 13-class task for the
intact-limbed subjects, PC-DA obtains an average of 84.47%
classification rate using 20 training samples per class. This is
similar to the PC-BL classification rate with 80 samples per class
(84.32%), LDA-DA obtains an average of 86.72% classification
rate using 20 training samples per class, which is comparable
to the LDA-BL classification rate with 80 samples per class
(86.98%). Similar trends are found in the other experiment conditions (see Figs. 3 and 4). This indicates that the DA method
can be used to expedite the recalibration on new days, approximately three or four times faster than the nonadaptive baseline
method.
As reported in Figs. 3 and 4, when more data are used for training, the advantage of the DA method diminishes. In addition, we
find that as the training samples increase, the benefits of adding
training samples decrease, both for DA and nonadaptive baseline methods. This means that the balance between the amount
of training time and classification accuracy should be considered. In a clinical setting of MP, the recalibration is expected to
be accomplished within a few minutes. The proposed method
may provide way to realize this goal. When the task includes
9 classes and the recording time per class is 4 s (total training
time is less than 2 min), the best method for intact-limbed subjects (PC-DA and LDA-DA) achieved a classification accuracy
of 95%, and the best method for amputee subjects (LDA-DA)
obtained a performance of 87% accuracy. In [23], the authors
proposed a prosthesis-guided training system, which can be initially trained or recalibrated quickly (6 s training data per class).
Combining their training system with the DA method proposed
here may be able to further shorten the recalibration process.
B. PC and LDA
When the training sample size is small, the performance of
LDA-BL is better than that of PC-BL, indicating the robustness
of LDA classifier. This is especially evident in the amputee subjects. The explanation for this outcome is that the polynomial
expansion of PC will make the dimensionality of the polynomial
vector become higher than, and increase exponentially with, that
of the original feature. For intact-limbed subjects, the dimensionality of the sEMG feature is 16, and the dimensionality of
the polynomial vector is 153 when the order is 2. Furthermore,
for amputee subjects, the dimensionality of the sEMG feature
is 24 and the dimensionality of the polynomial vector is as high
as 325. Consequently, when the training sample size is small,
the numerical solution of PC becomes unstable and underfitting,
potentially due to the singularity of M T M even when its inverse
is computed via the pseudoinverse.
Nevertheless, the focus of this study is to demonstrate that
the daily recalibration time can in fact be dramatically reduced
by the DA method, no matter what kind of baseline classifier is
used. In addition, the closed form of the leave-one-out prediction

for PC derived in (32) provides a solid theoretical framework,
a closed form, which has not been previously mentioned in the
literature. The novel DA methods based on PC and LDA may
be applied not only in MP, but also in other fields of signal
processing, like speech recognition or face identification, to
account for slowly varying signal characteristics.
C. Comparison to Related Studies
Several studies have investigated the sEMG pattern recognition in the context of day-to-day variability, in order to improve
the reusability of MP. In [29], the authors carried out an experiment lasting 21 days with one intact-limbed subject. They
demonstrated that retraining the classifier was key to maintain
successful recognition for 11 motion classes (about 90% accuracy). In their adaptive model, the classifier was continuously retrained with up to 30 preceding datasets for each testing dataset.
In [39], the authors conducted an experiment lasting five days
with five intact-limbed subjects for recognizing six motions.
They demonstrated that combining training data from different
days was important for improving the robustness of the system,
achieving an accuracy of above 90%. The importance of combining training data from different days were also emphasized
in [40], where the authors compared seven multiple feature sets
and resulting in accuracies of about 85% for classifying nine
motions.
The adaptive systems proposed in the above studies, however, required a considerable amount of training data. The ratio
between the training data size and testing data size is comparatively high. For example, in [40], this ratio is 9:1 (9 training
dataset/1 testing dataset). In a typical usage of MP, after calibration at the beginning of one day, the amputee would expect
the system to operate calibration-free throughout a typical 8 to
12 h working; that is, testing data size will be much greater than
training data size. To reduce the calibration time, in [41], the
authors tried to find a robust feature set using the same experiment data in [29]. They only used the first day data as training
set, and achieved a recognition rate above 90% with the best
feature sample entropy. In this study, we reduce the recalibration time with an adaptive classifier algorithm. In contrast to the
retraining system in [29], which only used the recent training
data, we propose a novel adaptation method which reuses the
models trained on previous days. These models have been used
for testing in previous days and they are “recycled” as inputs
for the current day. In addition, as compared to the studies in
[29] and [41], more subjects, especially amputee subjects, were
tested. Therefore, the results reported in the present study represent a significant contribution, and may be more relevant to
the ultimate application of MP in daily life.
In [32], the authors proposed DA algorithms based on SVM
to reduce the training time for a new patient by reusing the
models built for other patients. The framework of our algorithms
was similar to theirs. However, the present study focuses on
the day-to-day variability in sEMG signals, not the multiuser
myoelectric interface. In addition, the algorithms in the present
study are derived from PC and LDA, which are much simpler
to optimize than SVM. PC achieved comparable performance

LIU et al.: REDUCED DAILY RECALIBRATION OF MYOELECTRIC PROSTHESIS CLASSIFIERS BASED ON DOMAIN ADAPTATION

to SVM, as discussed in [33]. As showed in this study, LDA is
robust and convenient for the clinical settings of MP.
D. Limitations of Current Study
Depending on the framework of data processing in this study,
we show that the amount of retraining data required can be
very small for the additional day p + 1 when all the p prior
models are trained on long data recording (40 s per class) from
previous days. It is not clear if the advantage still holds for
day p + 2, when only the p models are used. If this is not the
case, we could reuse the adapted model in day p + 1 (not the
baseline model) because this model has achieved satisfactory
performance with small training data size; that is, the adapted
model in day p + 1 is reusable in day p + 2. In addition, in the
present study, we set the number of pretrained models (p) as nine.
It is possible that we can reduce the p without compromising
the classification performance. Further investigation is needed
to determine the least number of pretrained models required in
the realistic application. This would be the topic of a subsequent
study.
All the results in this study are based on offline analyses
and with steady-state sEMG signals. As shown in the literature,
the transient EMG signals would affect the overall performance
when not included in training [42]. It is reasonable to expect
that when the transient portion is included in the training data,
one would observe a similar trend as reported in the current
study. This, of course, needs to be validated with a systematic
analysis, preferably in an online study, as it was shown that
offline accuracy and online performance of pattern recognition
algorithm did not necessarily correlate [43]. However, this is
beyond the scope of the current study.
The temporal sequence of the experiment was not considered
in the tenfold cross-day-validation analysis in the current study.
It is possible that there is a consistent trend along the ten days
of the experiment, as reported in [44], which means that the ten
days of data would not be homogeneous. If this is the case, the
variability across different folds observed would be larger than
the case when the ten days of data are homogeneous. Nonetheless, this would not change the general trend reported here, and
the ability of the DA to reduce retraining data size.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a DA method to improve the robustness of myoelectric control algorithms against day-to-day
sEMG variability. The method reuses the models trained in earlier days as start point of the training stage in the new day. The
main contributions of this study are: 1) we introduce the concept
of DA into the day-to-day application of MP, 2) we propose two
novel DA algorithms for two kinds of classifiers, one for PC
and the other one for LDA, 3) an experiment lasting ten days,
especially including amputee subjects, has been conducted to
validate the method proposed, 4) and the experiment results
demonstrate that the adaptive model can be trained much faster
than the baseline model, using only a fraction of the retraining
data required by the nonadaptive methods. Consequently, this

173

study has the potential for improving the usability of MP in a
realistic scenario.
APPENDIX A
CLOSED FORM OF LEAVE-ONE-OUT PREDICTION OF PC
Here, we show that it is possible to write the leave-one-out
prediction of PC in a closed form; consequently, the equation
in (10) could be obtained. To be convenient, the polynomial
expansion p(s) of sample s just be denoted as s. As in (6), the
model W estimated from current training data is defined as
W = (M T M )−1 M T Y.

(20)

The solution of (20) is not affected by the order of row vectors
in M ; that is, the order of training samples. Therefore, when the
ith sample is removed from training dataset, we reorder

 the row
si
vectors of M and Y and decompose them as M =
and
M−i

where W −i represents the model of PC when the ith sample

Notice that we assume M T M and A are nonsingular here. In
the real implementation of the algorithm, (M T M )−1 is computed by its pseudoinverse (A−1 does not need to be computed).
Another point is that the closed form for leave-one-out prediction in (32) or (33) is not only suitable for PC, but in fact, it is
suitable in general for any classifier, which is trained based on

the LS criterion, i.e. (4)–(6). M could be any matrix composed
of row rectors, which are linear or nonlinear projections of the
original input features.
