Nonuniform Temperature Rise in In Vitro Osteoblast
Ultrasound Exposures With Associated Bioeffect
Jarkko J. Leskinen∗ , Anu Olkku, Anitta Mahonen, and Kullervo Hynynen, Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—There is a growing interest to use ultrasound to stimulate cellular material in vitro conditions for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. However, the beneficial effect resulting from
ultrasound exposure is not accurately specified. Many in vitro ultrasound setups are very vulnerable to temperature elevation due
to sound absorption, sound reflections, and inadequate heat transfer. The objective of this study is to show that temperature variations capable of modifying biological results may exist in common
in vitro exposure system. Human osteoblastic MG-63 cells plated
on a 24-well cell plate were treated with pulsed ultrasound in 37 ◦ C
water bath (10 min, frequency = 1.035 MHz, burst length = 200 μs,
pulse repetition frequency = 1 kHz, duty cycle = 0.2, temporalaverage acoustic power = 2 W, and peak pressure = 670–730 kPa)
and the activation of heat-dependent canonical Wnt cell signaling was measured. The ultrasound-induced temperature rise was
measured with thermocouples and infrared imaging. Chamberto-chamber comparison showed substantial temperature variation
(41.6 ◦ C versus 49.1 ◦ C) among the different chambers. The chamber walls were the most susceptible to heating. The variations in the
chamber temperatures correlated to variations in the cell signaling levels (1.3-fold versus 11.5-fold increase). These observations
underline the need for system-specific temperature measurements
during in vitro exposures.

I. INTRODUCTION
HERAPEUTIC ultrasound has clinical efficiency to accelerate bone fracture healing [1], [2] and has shown potential
to treat an ostearthritic cartilage [3], [4]. Therapeutic ultrasound
has been shown in vitro to have the capability to stimulate cells
relevant to tissue engineering applications for musculoskeletal
diseases, including bone [5], cartilage [6], and stem cells [7].
In vitro experiments have been used to derive effective exposure conditions and to determine the physical and biological

mechanisms responsible for this effect [8]–[30]. Studies have
indicated that ultrasound could also be a tool for tissue engineering. Ultrasound can augment the differentiation and maturation of three-dimensional cell structures and has, therefore,
potential to work as a bioreactor for tissue implant production [14], [16], [19], [22], [30].
A range of ultrasound output parameters have been used in
the in vitro studies. In many studies, the clinical Exogen device
has been used and it operates at 1.5 MHz frequency, 1 kHz
pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and 200 μs burst length (duty
cycle = 0.2), and produces a spatial and temporal average intensity (ISATA ) 30 mW/cm2 [31]. In other studies, the frequency
has typically ranged from around 1 up to 5 MHz [12], [13], [22],
[24]. Finally, 45 kHz frequency given in continuous wave-mode
has been used in several studies [11], [29]. Longer 2 ms bursts
with lower 100 Hz PRF and continuous-wave ultrasound have
also been used. Value of ISATA , which is the commonly reported
acoustic output parameter has ranged from 2 mW/cm2 [15] to
hundreds of milliwatts per centimeter square [12], [22], [26].
Despite a broad parameter space explored, only a few studies
have reported ultrasound-induced temperature elevations that
are large enough to potentially cause thermal effects [20], [25],
[26]. This has lead to a conclusion that temperature elevation
in in vitro low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) or lowintensity ultrasound (LIUS) is not a concern, and even if it
is present the nonthermal mechanism(s) dominate.
One of the physical changes associated with ultrasound exposures is, however, the temperature elevation. It has been known
for a long time that small temperature changes can alter the human fibroblast collagenase enzyme activity [32]. Transient exposure to mild hyperthermia has been reported to induce cyclin
D1 synthesis in fibroblasts [33], enhance differentiation of bone
marrow stromal cells and human osteoblastic MG-63 cells [34],
and enhance differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells
to osteoblasts [35]. With chondrocytes or chondrocyte-like cells,
mild [36], moderate [20], or higher level [37] hyperthermia has
been reported to improve, have no effect on or impair the cell
viability and proteoglycan synthesis, respectively. In a recent
study, human mesenchymal stem cells were seeded inside a
three-dimensional (3-D) cell matrix and placed inside a 41 ◦ C
cell culture incubator for an hour once a week [38]. These mild
hyperthermia treatments were found to both accelerate the cell
differentiation to bone cells and enhance the maturation of these
cells to bone cells.
Ultrasound-induced temperature rise, due to the energy absorption in plastic cell culture plates, is almost impossible to
completely avoid. Furthermore, ultrasound stimulation is usually repeated daily for several days or even weeks. Therefore,

even a small temperature rise may have stimulating or inhibiting
effects on cells compared with the control cells not receiving
the ultrasound exposure. However, in most in vitro studies to
date, the temperature elevation has either been ignored or a few
point measurements have been used to estimate the thermal effects. However, the induced temperature distributions may be
complex due to the sectional, three-dimensional structure of the
plastic cell culture plates used in experiments. Use of acoustic
gel coupling instead of circulating water coupling and the presence standing waves may result the highest ultrasound-induced
heating in a typical in vitro setup [39]. A significant source of
in vitro heating may result in the directly from the transducer
probe. Wu et al. have shown that in bone phantom, transducer
surface heating during the sonications may be a significant
source for superficial target heating [40]. Therefore, single point
measurements are not necessarily sufficient to provide a complete picture of the thermal exposure.
In our earlier study, we made an initial observation that the
different well chambers on a commercial 24-well plate experience dissimilar temperature elevations after identical ultrasound
exposures [26]. The setup was a typical near field exposure setup
used in many in vitro studies in this field. In this current study the
sonicated well plate was characterized in detail using fine wire
thermocouples and infrared (IR) imaging. Using transfected human MG-63 osteoblastic cells, we tested if the variability in
temperature between the well chambers could lead to variations
in cell signaling.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Ultrasound Setup
A detailed description of the exposure setup can be found
in our previous study, which utilized the same cell sonication
system [26]. Briefly, the in-house-manufactured ultrasound sonication device consists of six flat, air-backed PZT26 elements
(diameter = 25 mm; Ferroperm, Kvistgaard, Denmark). Only
one row of three transducers was used in this study. Each transducer was impedance-matched to 50 Ω, 0◦ phase using an LC
circuit. Three transducers were driven separately, with the waveforms generated and amplified by three function generators (Agilent 33120 A, Agilent Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and RF
amplifiers (ENI 240 L 50 dB, ENI, Rochester, NY, USA). The
six target wells were located in two different rows (A1, A3,
A5, C1, C3, and C5) on a commercial 24-well plate (Greiner
Bio-One, Kremsmünster, Austria) (see Fig. 1). The target wells
were partly filled with 510 μL of culture medium (DMEM;
Gibco, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA, with supplements [26])
and were sonicated with pulsed, 1.035 MHz ultrasound (10 min,
PRF = 1 kHz, burst length = 200 μs, duty cycle = 0.2) having
a temporal-average acoustic power (PTA ) of 2 W. The acoustic
power was measured in free field using a radiation force balance [41]. The well plate was positioned on a holder that kept the
well-plate bottom in contact with circulating and temperaturecontrolled (Grant GP200, Grant Instruments, Shepreth, UK)
deionized, degassed water. The water temperature was maintained at 37 ◦ C. The plate was immersed at the depth of 10 mm
in water. Air under the plate was displaced using a syringe con-

borders of the plate. Dashed circle around well (C3) depicts the nominal transducer area relative to the wells.

nected to a needle through flexible silicone tubing. Therefore,
the cavities on the edges of the plate (see Fig. 1) were filled with
water. The plate having the lid was covered with thin aluminumfoil frame to maintain the humidity and temperature during the
sonications. Three transducers were used simultaneously to expose two wells each (A1 and C1, A3 and C3, and A5 and C5)
such that six wells per plate were sonicated. The ultrasound
device was positioned using a stepper motor system (Unislide,
Time and Precision, Basingstoke, UK) at a distance of 7.7 mm
from the well plate bottom. At this sonication distance, the cells
are at the acoustic near field (last axial maximum approximately
at 90 mm).
The acoustic fields of the individual elements were measured
using the positioning system (Unislide) and calibrated 0.2 mm
needle hydrophone (sensing/physical diameter 0.2/0.67 mm,
Precision Acoustics, Dorset, UK) [see Fig. 2(a)–(c)]. The free
field measurement in degassed room temperature water for the
completely immersed transducers were done at a distance of
7.7 mm from the transducer face using the same drive voltage
and burst length as in the cell exposures. The hydrophone step
size was 0.4 mm (≈λ/4). The acoustic peak pressures were 730,
710, and 670 kPa for the elements 1–3, respectively. At this

2.96, 3.10, and 2.91 cm2 for the elements 1–3, respectively. The
respective effective intensity values for the elements 1–3 were
0.68, 0.65, and 0.69 W/cm2 , respectively
B. Temperature Measurements
The liquid-nitrogen-cooled IR camera used in this study
(wavelength = 3–5 μm, sensitivity = 0.05 ◦ C, accuracy = 1 ◦ C,
IRTIS-200; Irtis, Moscow, Russia) cannot be tilted to large angles without the risk of losing the image sensor cooling. To be
able to image the cell plate from the top, an IR reflecting surface mirror, manufactured from a normal glass covered mirror
by removing the protective paint layer at the back, was positioned at a 45◦ angle on top of the plate. The culture plate lid
covered the plate during ultrasound exposure but was removed
just before IR snapshots. An IR wavelength window suitable
for measuring polystyrene plates was used [42], [43]. The camera was calibrated by comparing it to thermocouple readings
in water, culture medium and polystyrene and was found to
be within 1 ◦ C in all materials. This includes the small differences in emissivities of water (0.97–0.98, [44]) and polystyrene
(0.96, [42]) and was not corrected to the images. Emissivity of
medium was estimated to be close to these values. The thermocouples, consisting of copper and constantan wire (75 μm;
Omega, Manchester, UK), were solder-connected. The plastic
insulation was removed to avoid heating due to ultrasoundinduced absorption [45], and the thermocouples were positioned
parallel to the direction of ultrasound propagation, in contact
with the well bottom. The temperature values were acquired
using a computer controlled digital multimeter (1 reading/s;
model 2000 and TCSCAN-2001, Keithley Instruments, Cleveland, OH, USA). Each probe was calibrated in the heated water

bath against an immersion thermostat (Grant GP200). The small
viscous artifact was removed from the measurements by fitting
an exponential curve on the temperature decay data 7 s after
the ultrasound was turned off and using the fitted curve to extrapolate the peak temperature when the sound was on [46].
Four different locations inside of each target well (see Fig. 3)
were measured using the thermocouples. The positions varied
among the wells to cover the assumed maximum and minimum
temperature points in each well.
C. Cells and Cell Exposures
The human MG-63 osteoblastic cells were cultured as a
monolayer in 24-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) with density
of 35 000 cells per well and 510 μL medium volume, and were
sonicated as described earlier. The control cells in separate plates
were treated identically but excluded the ultrasound exposure.
The cells were transfected with TOPflash, a TCF-binding site

reporter plasmid (Upstate Biotechnology/Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA). This reporter gene measures the activity of Wnt
signaling, which is known to have a vital part in bone cell
metabolism [47], but also has a relevant role during fracture
healing [48]. Recently, we showed that Wnt signaling can be
stimulated through ultrasound exposure by both thermal and
nonthermal mechanisms. Detailed descriptions of the culture
protocol, reagents, and cell exposure protocol can be found in
our earlier study [26].

profiles across well C3 and similarly sonicated well C5, taken from the IR images. Vertical dotted lines depict the thickness of the chamber walls. Sonication
parameters are as in Fig. 4.

D. Statistics
Cell exposures were repeated three times with the total of 18
wells (three replicates per analyzed well). Thermocouple measurements in four different locations in of the each six wells
were repeated three times. IR imaging was performed in a single plate. Statistical differences in Wnt signaling between the
different wells were analyzed using a two-tailed paired t-test
(∗p < 0.05; Excel 2007, Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA).
III. RESULTS
To characterize the heating of the exposed commercial 24well plate, the temperature inside a single cell chamber located
at the center of the plate was studied first. The thermocouple
measurements of well C3 showed that temperature accumulation was highest at the well walls, indicating high ultrasound
absorption (see Fig. 4). The heating and cooling rates were similar in all four thermocouple locations at the minute-scale.
The steady-state IR image of the sonicated well verified that
the temperature rise was highest at the polystyrene walls, including the walls of the neighboring, nonsonicated wells [see
Fig. 5(a)]. The distribution inside the central area of the well was
fairly smooth as seen on the horizontal profile of the sonicated
well [see Fig. 5(b)]. In the similarly sonicated adjacent well C5,
the thermal distribution was found to be nearly identical with
well C3, but having a smaller (2–3 ◦ C) absolute temperature
increase.

To observe the temperature variations between different well
chambers on a single 24-well plate, the analysis was extended
to six different wells (see Fig. 6). These measurements revealed
that the average temperature over all six wells was 40.9 ± 2.1 ◦ C
and that the heating at the centrally located well C3 was 4.0–
5.7 ◦ C higher than in peripherally located wells (A1, A3, A5, and
C1). The temperature elevation next to the polystyrene wall was
again the highest in all wells studied. Temperature variations
between different wells on the same plate were confirmed by
measuring the temperature rise using thermocouples in locations
TC1–TC4. The average temperature elevation values are shown
in Fig. 7(a). The thermocouple measurements were congruent
with the IR data as the maximum temperature variation among
the wells sonicated with the same transducer element (A3 versus
C3) was 5.9 ◦ C. The temperature averaged over all wells and
measurement points TC1–TC4 was 44.4 ± 3.0 ◦ C. The largest
temperature deviation when points TC1–TC4 were averaged
was observed in well C1 (±2.1 ◦ C), verifying the uneven heating
[see Fig. 6(b)].
As the temperature variation inside the well was evident, the
possible biological outcome of this effect was studied using
TOPflash reporter and human MG-63 osteoblastic cells [see
Fig. 7(b)]. The increase of TOPflash activity showed a correlation with the well temperature above a temperature of approximately 44–45 ◦ C, as the TOPflash activity was significantly
higher in the wells C3 (11.5-fold induction) and C5 (6.3-fold

IV. DISCUSSION
The therapeutic effect of ultrasound on tissue engineering and
treatment of various musculoskeletal disorders is well recognized. However, the ultrasound mechanism that causes these effects has not yet been accurately identified. Ultrasound-induced
temperature elevation is present in most in vitro setups, at least
at some extent. In our present study, Figs. 4–6 illustrate that

the polystyrene chamber wall is the most susceptible to increases in temperature during the ultrasound exposures. In our
measurements, the size of the transducer was larger than the
diameter of the exposed chamber (also in [17], [25], and [49]),
and therefore, the plastic chamber wall was directly exposed
to the ultrasound field. This is analogous to the configurations
in which the exposure area inside a larger vessel is decreased
using a polystyrene ring to fix and immobilize the biological
sample [50]. This is also representative of the setup where a
polypropylene cell tube with narrowing conical end contains the
small cell pellet at the cone tip and is exposed to a wide ultrasound field [16]. There are many factors that may also influence
the temperature elevations. When an efficient acoustic absorber
is placed on top of the cells inside the well chamber to attenuate
standing wave formation [51], [52], it can be another possible
source for increased heating if it is placed close to the cells.
If sound cannot propagate and absorb freely after transmitting
through the biological sample, the formed reflections between
the transducer and well bottom, and transducer and reflecting
surface (air), will amplify this heating. In our earlier study, relatively high acoustic power (PTA = 4 W, other parameters as
in this study) resulted in less than 1◦ C temperature rise inside a
commercial polystyrene well when the area of ultrasound beam
was smaller than the well area and the ultrasound was allowed
to propagate freely through the well [53]. Therefore, the intrinsic sound absorption and resulting temperature effects of
relatively thin walled (≈1 mm) polystyrene plastic cell culture
plates may generally be small, but the type of ultrasound setup
may change this dramatically. Similar configurations with efficient ultrasound transmission have been previously described
and applied [8], [10], [54], [55]. Furthermore, the different plastic materials have different acoustic ultrasound loss factors. For
example, polypropylene cell tubes may be less suitable exposure
chambers due to the higher acoustic energy loss of polypropylene compared with, e.g., polystyrene (0.18–0.36 dB/mm versus
0.51–1.82 dB/mm at 5 MHz) [56].

The floor structure of a commercial cell plate may not be a
continuous flat plate, as the edges of the plates may contain open
cavities (see Fig. 1). These cavities may be partly or completely
filled with the water. As a consequence, the wells located at the
edges of the plate will have water in contact with their walls but
the center wells will only have contact to the water through their
bottoms. The IR-images demonstrated that the peripheral wells
that experienced the greatest cooling (see Fig. 6(a), wells A1 and
C1) had lower temperature elevations than the centrally located
wells (see Fig. 6(b), wells C3 and C5). The largest temperature
difference was seen between the wells A3 and C3. Most of this
difference can be explained by the presence circulating water,
which partly immerses the well A3. In well A3, the cavity under
the well spans half of the well circumference (see Fig. 1). Water
rises up to this cavity when the well is immersed in water and
air is removed under the well (in well A1, this cavity is 270◦ ,
Fig. 1). The presence of mode conversion in plate may also
have an effect to temperature elevation [39], [57]. The shear
waves generated at the air-surrounded centrally located well C3
may be subjected to higher transmission losses than the waves
generated at the well A3, which is half-surrounded with water
having acoustic impedance closer to polystyrene [39]. In our
setup, this temperature variation results in unequal biological
activation in different well chambers [see Fig. 7(b)].
Whether acoustic coupling between the transducer and cell
chamber is achieved by circulating water or acoustic gel may
also have an effect on the induced temperature rise. Thermocouple measurements inside a standard polystyrene six-well
cell chamber and normal culturing conditions after a moderate ultrasound exposure (acoustic power 0.12 W corresponding
ISATA approximately 30 mW/cm2 at 1.625 MHz for 20 min)
generates a temperature elevation of 2.7 ◦ C with acoustic gel
coupling, but only 0.3 ◦ C with circulated water coupling [39].
A recently published tissue engineering study [28] utilizing a
1 MHz continuous-wave ultrasound setup and gel coupling implied that exposure conditions, including temperature elevation,
were similar when circulated water was used as the acoustic coupling medium [58]. Our results indicate that at the applied acoustic intensity (100 mW/cm2 ) with gel coupling, the ultrasoundinduced temperature elevations may have been substantial.
Another typical way to conduct the sound to the cells is to immerse the (sterilized) transducer directly into the medium-filled
well just above the sample [11], [24], [50], [59]–[62]. This configuration enables undisturbed sound transmission to the sample and limits the standing wave formation within the exposure
volume. However, possible temperature elevation may still be
relevant. In a recent in vitro study commercial low-frequency,
low-intensity continuous-wave device (45 kHz at 25 mW/cm2
average intensity) was placed directly inside a standard six-well
chamber [63]. The culture medium temperature was reported to
be elevated 3.3 ◦ C after 30 min of sonication.
IR imaging is a spatially accurate, noninvasive, and fast
method to characterize complex ultrasound configurations, revealing possible temperature anomalies. The largest limitation
is that the liquid immersed interfaces are not observed, just the
superficial layer. If the exposure system is closed (i.e., requires
opening before imaging) as in our case, convection through

925

moving air and evaporation will lower the absolute temperatures. Different materials also have different emissivity factors,
which affect the absolute temperature accuracy [64]. Therefore,
using IR imaging together with thermocouple probes creates
an efficient method to characterize many in vitro ultrasound
systems.
Perhaps the most widely utilized commercial ultrasound apparatus applied in the field of ultrasound in vitro and tissue engineering research is the Exogen fracture healing device (Smith
and Nephew, Memphis, TN, USA). The device has temporal average power output of only 117 mW at 1.5 MHz [31] and can be
assumed to induce generally low temperature elevations. This
device type or corresponding manufacturer modified research
devices have been used in many studies, indicating similarity
among studies with respect to the ultrasound exposure level and
its interpretation. The literature indicates that within studies the
nominal, undisturbed ultrasound output intensities [15], [27] and
exposure times [65], [66] have been varied. The level of culture
medium inside the well insert may also influence the temperature rise through acoustic field alteration and the cooling effect
of liquid. Very low culture medium levels [67], “normal” levels as in this study and [68], [69] or high levels with altered
sonication direction [15], [70] have been applied. Our results
from this study, considering this heterogeneity in parameters
and setups, imply that a simple Celsius per Acoustic intensity
constant cannot be given for even the commercial ultrasound
systems. Park et al. [25] have reported that sonication at this
level for total of 50 min in discontinuous manner in their custom in vitro setup elevated the medium temperature above the
physiological level. The authors also verified that in this case the
ultrasound-induced temperature elevation had an anabolic effect
on glycosaminoglycan synthesis on osteoarthritic cartilage constructs. Unfortunately, very little or no information regarding
the ultrasound-induced temperature rise is usually reported for
these systems.
There are several limitations in this study. Our study was conducted using cells in monolayer instead of three dimensional cell
pellets or matrices that are more relevant to tissue engineering.
In these structures the patterns of pressure and thermal fields
and resulting bioeffects may be even more complicated. Earlier studies have reported spatially varying ultrasound effects in
3-D cell structures [16], [27]. Furthermore, only single setup
and cell line was tested in this study. Large number if not the
majority of the recent ultrasound studies in this field of research
have conducted the sonications in the acoustic near field (see
Fig. 2) including a standing wave component. In sonoporation,
presence of standing waves has been shown to be an important factor influencing the sonoporation efficiency [71]. The
sonication parameters of this study are typically used in this
field. Pulse repetition frequency and burst length/duty cycle are
identical with the Exogen device. One megahertz operating frequency with these burst parameters is used in many previous
studies [12], [16], [72]. The nominal level of intensity is higher
than the widely used 30 mW/cm2 (ISATA ). However, we have
found the higher intensities effective in our previous studies using similar type ultrasound setups [20], [26]. Therefore, in this
way, our setup presents a typical and effective way to sonicate

cellular material. Testing of several different cell lines, setups,
and possible bioeffects is out of scope of this study. For example,
presence of gas bubbles in nondegassed culture medium may be
important factor affecting to the outcome. Bubbles act as nuclei
for the acoustic cavitation in in vitro and are especially effective
when standing wave is present [71] and may have an impact on
the induced temperature elevation.
As confirmed in our study, the variation in the temperature
of the ultrasound exposed cells can, indeed, reflect directly into
the biological outcome. Therefore, in light of our results, we
believe that to apply repeatable stimulations to biological tissue
engineering material, a detailed temperature characterization
and systematic exposure protocol are a necessity for in vitro
ultrasound exposures.
