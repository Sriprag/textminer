A Chance-Constrained Programming Approach
to Preoperative Planning of Robotic Cardiac
Surgery Under Task-Level Uncertainty
Hamidreza Azimian, Michael D. Naish, Member, IEEE, Bob Kiaii, and Rajni V. Patel, Life Fellow, IEEE

Abstract—In this paper, a novel formulation for robust surgical
planning of robotics-assisted minimally invasive cardiac surgery
based on patient-specific preoperative images is proposed. In this
context, robustness is quantified in terms of the likelihood of intraoperative collisions and of joint limit violations. The proposed
approach provides a more accurate and complete formulation than
existing deterministic approaches in addressing uncertainty at the
task level. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the dexterity of robotic
arms can be quantified as a cross-entropy term. The resulting planning problem is rendered as a chance-constrained entropy maximization problem seeking a plan with the least susceptibility toward uncertainty at the task level, while maximizing the dexterity
(cross-entropy term). By such treatment of uncertainty at the task
level, spatial uncertainty pertaining to mismatches between the
patient-specific anatomical model and that of the actual intraoperative situation is also indirectly addressed. As a solution method,
the unscented transform is adopted to efficiently transform the resulting chance-constrained entropy maximization problem into a
constrained nonlinear program without resorting to computationally expensive particle-based methods.

I. INTRODUCTION

A. Background
URING the last decade, the notion of adopting robotic
manipulators to perform surgical procedures has become
popular due to technological achievements. Accessing surgical
targets through small incisions on the patient’s body has been
proven to offer many benefits. Yet even as adoption increases,
the success rate of robotics-assisted procedures has remained
limited due to complexities such as intraoperative collisions,
mechanical joint limits, and lack of reachability that can lead to
task infeasibility. This is due to the fact that: 1) the arms and
the instruments are rigid 2) once the setup arms and the incision ports are in place they cannot be changed. One approach
that can increase the chance of successful accomplishment of
robotics-assisted interventions (RAI) is patient-specific preoperative planning that includes an insightful selection of the incisions as well as a proper placement of the robotic arms based
on the patient’s preoperative anatomical data. Typically, patientspecific anatomical data are captured from imaging modalities
such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomography (CT). However, the patient’s intraoperative anatomy
can significantly differ from the model predicted by the preoperative data. Physiological motions, altered geometry caused
by chest insufflation and/or lung collapse, as well as tissue deformations inflicted by tool/tissue interactions can introduce
inaccuracies in the preoperative model. Also, patient placement
error could contribute to the geometric uncertainty. To complicate matters, the contribution of the inherent uncertainty in
surgical tasks that arises from the variability of surgeons’ skill
and experience levels must be considered as well.
This paper presents an extended version of the work initially
outlined in [1] and [2], and provides an alternative formulation
to that proposed in [3] for robust preoperative planning. For

the sake of brevity, readers are referred to [3] for a rigorous
literature survey on related work.
In [3], a deterministic approach to address geometric uncertainty in patient-specific preoperative planning was proposed.
In general, accurate identification and incorporation of spatiotemporal uncertainties in preoperative planning may result in
a hard-to-solve problem. The proposed approach in [3] could
partially alleviate this computational complexity by translating
spatial uncertainties of the manipulator’s tip—in a vicinity of
the surgical target—into the uncertainty in the wrist position.
Such treatment of uncertainty delivers an approximate representation of the actual geometric uncertainty at the expense of
yielding more conservative results. As a matter of fact, [3] provided a near-to-exact solution method to preoperative planning
with an approximate representation of geometric uncertainty.
In this paper, an approximate solution method for preoperative
planning with an exact representation of geometric uncertainty
is proposed. With the proposed formulation, it is possible to
maximize the maneuverability of the current multiarm surgical robotic systems (such as the da Vinci system from Intuitive
Surgical, Inc.) by assuming spatio-temporal uncertainties at the
task level. This entails decomposition of spatial uncertainty into
position and orientation uncertainties. This is particularly advantageous when different tasks and procedures may have different
requirements in terms of translational and rotational motions.
The planning problem is rendered as a chance-constrained programming problem, and an efficient solution method based on
the unscented transform is proposed. Unlike linearization techniques, the proposed technique does not require the calculation
of the constraint’s gradient, nor does it resort to propagating
a large population of particles as in Monte Carlo methods. In
this formulation, an optimum plan is sought while ensuring that
robustness with respect to the lack of information at the task
level is increased. This is achieved by inflating the entropy of
the task in the Cartesian space, while the cross entropy of the
task in the joint space and Cartesian space is maximized as a
measure of kinematic dexterity.
B. Methods
It has been shown that every surgical procedure can be expressed in terms of several surgical tasks that can be expressed
in terms of hand gestures (see [4]–[9]). In most of these papers, the authors have utilized statistical inference techniques to
infer and recognize surgical gestures from a pool of hand motion data collected from different surgeons. Gesture recognition
at each instant is accomplished by picking the gesture with the
maximum likelihood. In other words, gestures are treated as random variables whose statistical moments are inferred from the
spatio-temporal information extracted from the recorded data.
In this paper, this concept is taken one step further and the
representation of task gestures in terms of task frames, that
are specified in a vicinity of anatomical targets, is proposed as a
more objective way of expressing surgical performance. In other
words, if gestures are the words of the language of surgery, task
frames are taken to be the alphabet of that language. This approach can accommodate anatomical differences for different

613

patients into the description of the procedure. In other words,
this approach tailors the task frames not only to the procedure,
but also to the patient, resulting in a patient/procedure-specific
description of the surgery. This paper does not focus on the
methods used for the inference of the task frames, but on the development of a procedure/patient-specific preoperative planning
formalism based on the extracted task frames.
Surgical task gestures are prone to spatio-temporal uncertainties for various reasons, such as tissue deformations. Also,
variability in the surgeons’ skill and experience levels, could
further contribute to these uncertainties. In order to address this,
gestures—and therefore task frames—must be treated as random variables. Statistical inference techniques can provide an
estimate of the uncertainty for a given dataset, and in this sense
the estimated uncertainty is subjective. This paper presents a
planning formalism that addresses geometric uncertainties at
the task level in terms of translational and rotational uncertainties in the task frames. The main objective of developing such a
formalism is to enable preoperative plans to have minimal susceptibility to the lack of information at the task level. In other
words, the proposed formalism is used to determine the largest
uncertainty at the task level for which the chances of collisions,
joint limit violations, and task infeasibility remain sufficiently
small. One implication of this approach is that plans with less
susceptibility are sought without making any particular assumption regarding the surgeon’s skill and experience.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the
preoperative planning scheme is formally exposed as a chanceconstrained entropy maximization problem, and an efficient solution method is recommended. The application of the proposed
scheme to robotics-assisted minimally invasive cardiac surgery
is demonstrated through a case study in Section III, and the performance of the scheme is investigated over several studies in
Section IV. Finally, discussions and conclusions are presented
in Section V.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
RAI are typically enabled by adopting three arms, including two arms equipped with the right and left instruments,
and one arm to carry the endoscope. Let xR = (log(gR ))∨ and
xL = (log(g L ))∨ be the 6-D pose vectors pertaining
 to theright

and left instruments, respectively, where gR = R0R p1R and


gL = R0L p1L ∈ SE(3) are the 4 × 4 transformation matrices attached to the tips of the instruments defined in terms of
the rotation matrices RR and RL ∈ SO(3) as well as the position vectors pR and pL ∈ R3 , and (·)∨ is the vee operator that is
used to extract a 6-D vector from a spatial transformation matrix
(see [10] for more details). Throughout this paper, it is assumed
that the pose of the instruments in the neighborhood of the task
frames is represented by two independent Gaussian distributions
denoted by xR ∼ N (μx,R , Qx,R ) and xL ∼ N (μx,L , Qx,L ),
in which μx,R ∈ R6 and μx,L ∈ R6 resemble the desired task
frames, and task uncertainties are represented by Qx,L ∈ R6×6
and Qx,R ∈ R6×6 . In practice, for a given task in the vicinity of
a target frame, the endoscope remains still; therefore, the pose

614

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. 19, NO. 2, MARCH 2015

of the endoscope, xE , is henceforth treated as a deterministic
variable.
In order to improve the likelihood of successful completion
of a given surgical procedure, the sensitivity of the preoperative plan with respect to the task-level uncertainty must be
reduced. With a task modeled by Gaussian distributions, this
can be achieved by maximizing a norm of the covariance matrices while keeping the chance of failure below some threshold, or
alternatively, by minimizing a norm of the information matrix,
subject to the constraints. It is well known that the information
entropy is a measure of the lack of information about a random process, and according to the maximum entropy principle,
among all candidates, when choosing a probability distribution,
the one with the maximum entropy should be chosen [11].

tor dispersion is minimized for a given dispersion in the pose
of the instrument in Cartesian space. This can be realized by
minimizing the following cross entropy term:

and the aggregate multicriteria objective function (to be minimized), i.e., Ent(X ) = −Ent1 (X ) + Ent2 (X ), can be

B. Constraints

A. Objective Function
The objective of the proposed planning formalism is articulated in terms of two criteria: procedure entropy and kinematic
performance. The formal definition of these criteria are as follows.
1) Procedure Entropy: Let a procedure be modeled as a sequence of N stochastic task frames given as



xR (k)
for k = 1, 2, . . . , N
(1)
X =
xL (k)
where the right and left frames are represented by Gaussian
distributions: xR (k) ∼ N (μx,R (k), Qx,R (k)) and xL (k) ∼
N (μx,L (k), Qx,L (k)). Note that although the mean value of
the tasks, and as a result the procedure, is assumed a priori
and independent of the plan, the tolerable task uncertainty is
determined by the plan. As a measure of the lack of information
regarding a procedure, the information entropy of the procedure,
can be expressed as
1 N
Σ
(log(|Qx,R (k)|) + log(|Qx,L (k)|))
N k =1
(2)
where | · | is the matrix determinant operator, and log(|Qx |) is
recognized as the Shannon entropy of the task. As will be discussed, the goal is to find the plan associated with the maximum
tolerable procedure entropy.
2) Performance: In [1], a Jacobian-based measure of dexterity was utilized as a measure of kinematic performance
for preoperative planning. In this paper, kinematic performance is accommodated in the objective function by means
of the task entropy across Cartesian and joint spaces. This
measure is physically interpretable, and renders the multicriteria objective function of the planning scheme as an entropy maximization problem. Suppose that the right and left
task frames in Cartesian space, denoted by Gaussian distributions xR (k) and xL (k) are given, and the propagated
distributions in joint space can be approximated by Gaussian distributions qR (k) ∼ N (μq,R (k), Qq,R (k)) and qL (k) ∼
N (μq,L (k), Qq,L (k)), where qR ∈ R6 and qL ∈ R6 are the
right and left instrument joint vectors. Note that this assumption
is by no means restrictive, but an indication of an approximation
in the solution method. Generally, it is desired that the joint vecEnt1 (X ) =

Due to the stochastic nature of the procedure, constraints
must be articulated probabilistically. The main constraints can
be classified into three different categories: constraints imposed
to avoid collisions, constraints imposed to avoid joint limit violations, and constraints imposed by target reachability. In here,
these categories are formally described in terms of the planning
parameters, denoted by P ∈ Rn , and the instrument and the
endoscope pose vectors.
Suppose that a surgical task triplet (determined based on task
requirements and patient-specific preoperative data) is given
as x̃ = {xR , xL , xE }. For a given plan P, the necessary and
sufficient conditions for collision avoidance while performing x̃
can be described in terms of the minimum distances among the
arms, the patient’s body and external objects, denoted by d =
fd (x̃, P), where fd : R15 × Rn → Ra . This constraint can be
formally represented as a chance constraint, i.e.,
	



P d(k) > 0a×1 	P, x̃(k) > 1 −  for k = 1, . . . , N (5)
where 0 <   1 is a threshold, and P (·) is the probability
operator.
In a similar fashion, given a plan P, while performing task
x the chance of avoiding joint limits must also be guaranteed
to remain below some threshold. This can be articulated using
the inverse kinematics of the arms denoted by q = fIK (x, P),
where fIK : R6 or 3 × Rn → R6 or 3 . The corresponding chance
constraints are given as
	



P qR (k) ∈ Qvalid,R 	P, x̃(k) > 1 −  for k = 1, . . . , N
(6)
	



P q L (k) ∈ Qvalid,L 	P, x̃(k) > 1 −  for k = 1, . . . , N
(7)
where Qvalid refers to the valid subset of the joint space determined by the joint limits.
Another set of constraints is imposed by target reachability.
Task frames are normally situated on (or are close to) surfaces,
and depending on the concavity and convexity of the surface,
the arm configuration by which the task frame can be reached,
and as a result the maneuverability of the instrument pertaining
to that task, may be confined. Since an exact and complete consideration of geometrical constraints, imposed by the patient’s

In general, finding the exact solution of (10) is not trivial.
In the following sections, it is shown that the exposed stochastic optimization problem can be efficiently approximated by
an ordinary constrained nonlinear programming problem. The
proposed method is shown to be capable of providing a more accurate approximation than simple linearization, while avoiding
computationally expensive Monte Carlo methods.

anatomy, can result in an NP-hard problem, only topological
constraints at the target and the access port are considered. The
configuration of the arms can be described as c = fc (x, P),
where fc : R6 or 3 × Rn → Rb . Vector c may include some or
all of the pose components pertaining to some control locations on the arms. As opposed to the joint limits that confine
reachability, these constraints are imposed by the topology of
the environment (in this case, patient’s anatomy). Therefore,
the reachability requirements can be described in terms of the
reachable subset of the configuration space, denoted by Creach ,
as




P cL (k) ∈ Creach 	P, x̃(k) > 1 − ,

for k = 1, . . . , N.

Fig. 1 demonstrates how the reachability constraints at the trocar
plane and at the target can confine maneuverability . In a simplified scenario,
 the reachability constraints can be defined in
γ1
terms of γ =
, where γ1 and γ2 are the approach angles
γ2
of the instruments at the trocar plane and target, respectively
(see Fig. 1). In fact, this simplification is valid under the assumption that the instruments consist of rigid straight links. In
case of adopting instruments with flexible links, reachability has
to be translated into a higher number of constraints.
Finally, the planning problem can be rendered as the following
chance-constrained programming problem:

|Qx,R (k)|2 |Qx,L (k)|2




P d(k) > 0a×1 |P, x̃(k) > 1 − 

C. Problem Transformation
An obvious solution method for (10) is transforming the problem into a deterministic optimization problem. Two common
methods are usually utilized:
1) Propagating a dense population of randomly generated
particles through the constraint functions and examining
the constraint satisfaction rate of the propagated particles.
Despite providing accurate approximations, this method
is computationally expensive, and the number of function
evaluations can increase exponentially as the number of
constraints increases.
2) Replacing each chance constraint by one deterministic
counterpart that is parameterized in terms of the distribution moments of the chance constraint. Obviously, this
requires the distribution of the constraints to be known.
However, the chance constraints generally are nonlinear
functions of the pose vectors, and their actual distributions
are unknown and potentially non-Gaussian. One common
workaround is to approximate the mean and variance of
the chance constraints in terms of the constraint functions’
gradients and the mean and variance of the random variables. Unfortunately, this method typically fails to capture
the true statistics of the constraint particularly when the
function is highly nonlinear [12]. To further complicate
matters, analytical expressions for the gradients may not
always be available, which will result in a higher number
of function evaluations.
More recently, a theoretical framework has been developed
for the analysis of the propagation of probability distributions
on motion groups (see [13]–[16]). In [14], the authors showed
that when two members of SE(3) are multiplied, the resulting
error distribution is the convolution of their respective error distributions. In [17], error propagation in needle steering has been
studied using a second-order approximation of the propagated
covariance proposed in [15]. The authors used the formulation
to evaluate the optimal insertion location for flexible needle
steering. The proposed formalism is sound, and provides an an-

(15)

2) Transformed Optimization Problem: Once the mean and
covariance matrices of the chance constraints are approximated,
they can be replaced by a set of deterministic constraints. For
 = 1 − Φ(ζ), where ζ ∼ N (0, 1), and Φ(·) is the standard
normal cumulative distribution function, (10) can be substituted
by the following constrained nonlinear programming problem

alytical second-order approximation of the error propagated on
SE(3). The authors, used a sparse sampling method to obtain
the ground truth for the validation of the formalism. This suggests that the performance of the proposed formalism can yet
be inferior to that of sparse sampling methods.
As an alternative approach, the Unscented Transform [12],
a sampling method, is proposed to be adopted to estimate the
statistics of the constraints by fitting a Gaussian distribution to
a sparse set of samples propagated through the nonlinear function. Unlike in Monte Carlo methods, these samples are not
randomly selected, but by utilizing a selection mechanism, the
inference of the statistical properties of the constraints is realized by propagating only a small sample set. Fig. 2 portrays a
conceptual comparison between the unscented transform, linearization, and particle methods.

III. APPLICATION TO CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS SURGERY
ASSISTED BY THE da Vinci SYSTEM
Coronary artery bypass grafting is one of the most common
cardiac procedures that is currently performed using robotic
assistance (the da Vinci surgical system). The procedure is
performed through three incisions (two for the left and right
instruments and one for the endoscope) located in the patient’s intercostal spaces (ICS), and is composed of two major tasks: left internal mammary artery (LIMA) harvesting, and
anastomosis of the LIMA to the left anterior descending artery.
LIMA harvesting is usually performed robotically; however,
due to complexities, the anastomosis may be performed under
direct vision and through a minithoracotomy [19], [20]. It is
easier to represent LIMA harvesting task with a sequence of
task frames that must be reached by the instruments. Ideally, the
task frames could be inferred empirically from in vivo observation of the instruments’ gestures, or more systematically, by
statistical analysis of the instruments’ spatio-temporal data. The

AZIMIAN et al.: CHANCE-CONSTRAINED PROGRAMMING APPROACH TO PREOPERATIVE PLANNING OF ROBOTIC CARDIAC SURGERY

617

task consists of two main gestures: pulling the tissue around the
artery with the left instrument, and cutting it using an electrocautery attached on the right instrument (see the gestures for
LIMA harvesting in [21]).
The da Vinci surgical system is one of a few approved robotic
platforms that are currently used clinically for RAI. The patientside subsystem consists of four robotic arms of which two instrument arms and an endoscope arm are generally used for
RAI. Each instrument arm consists of six passive joints for arm
placement and six active joints, while the endoscope has four
passive joints and four active joints. Finding the optimal values
of the passive joints (which determine the configuration of the
arms) is part of the planning that is further discussed in the
following section.

This section outlines an implementation of the proposed formalism through an illustrative case study. The implementation
is utilized for preoperative planning of LIMA harvesting for a
CABG candidate based on the patient’s preoperative CT images.
In this case study, tasks are described with 5-D fixtures rather
than 6-D coordinate frames to avoid ambiguity in the representation. Each fixture is represented with a position vector as well
as a normal vector onto the surface where the target is located,
i.e., x ∈ R5 . In addition to seeking the maximum procedure
entropy, the planning problem consists of finding the optimal
port locations, valid values for the passive joints, as well as the
position of the patient with respect to the base. The optimal plan
is rendered as the solution of (16), i.e.,

The unscented transform was utilized to estimate μq , Qq , μd ,
Qd , μγ , and Qγ in (17) (the inverse kinematics solutions for
uncertain 5-D fixtures are given in the Appendix.). The LIMA
harvesting task was represented by six 5-D fixtures, i.e., N = 6.
The success probability was chosen to be at 98%, i.e.,  = 0.02.
The resulting constrained nonlinear programming problem was
solved using an active-set sequential quadratic programming
method using the BFGS Hessian update implemented by fmincon in MATLAB. Algorithm 1 outlines the steps taken to solve
the planning problem.
The algorithm starts by picking an ICS triad on the patient’s
rib cage represented by c̃ = {c1 , c2 , c3 }, where ci (u) ∈ R3
denote parametric spatial curves that represent the ICS and I
is the set of these spatial curves. Then a set of initial plans P0i
are randomly generated and passed to FindFeas. FindFeas is an
implementation of a minimax optimization that takes P0i and
iteratively adjusts the plan until a feasible solution is achieved.
If a feasible solution, denoted by P0 , is found, it is then passed

as an initial value to Optimize, which is an implementation of
(16). Among all possible combinations, only those triads that
are more likely to yield feasible results are chosen. For instance,
to ensure a better hand/eye alignment, it is normally assumed
that the endoscope ICS is between the other two.
The planning took less than 4 h for 16 ICS triads on a PC
with an i7 3.4 GHz QUAD core CPU. The optimal placement of
the arms with respect to the patient (as instructed by the optimal
plan) is shown in Fig. 3. The collision-free operation of the active
sections while reaching the individual target fixtures is shown
in Fig. 4. Finally, the optimal port locations are illustrated in
Fig. 5 (see the following section for more description of Fig. 5).
According to the figure, the optimal port locations for the left
and right instruments, and the endoscope are located in the third,
sixth, and fifth ICS, respectively. In [19], the author suggests that
the ports should be placed in the third, seventh, and fifth ICS.
While this is simply a rough guideline based on the clinician’s
experience and expertise and does not consider patient-specific

aspects of the surgery, it is very close to the result that has been
obtained in this case study.
B. Evaluation
The actual reliability achieved by using the resulting plan P ∗
was evaluated by a Monte Carlo simulation. Given the optimal
plan P ∗ , M = 1000 pairs of target fixtures, denoted by xR,i
and xL,i , with Q∗x,R (k) and Q∗x,L (k) were randomly generated.
Then, the satisfaction of the chance constraints (5)–(9) was
investigated. The constraint satisfaction statistics at every target
task fixture are provided in Fig. 6 (left). As the figure shows,
more than 94% of all constraints are satisfied by all samples,
and about 4% of the rest are satisfied by more than 98% of

the samples. However, one might be concerned with a more
objective assessment of the results, e.g., the percentage of the
samples with 100% satisfaction rate as the chance of success
[see Fig. 6 (right)]. As the figure suggests, the average rate is
about 94%. This is due to the fact that (16) does not contemplate
the chance of success directly, but indirectly by contemplating
the individual chance constraints that constitute the chance of
success.
For illustration purposes, the above simulation was implemented for a second time but with 100 samples. The situation
of the feasible samples within the surgical workspace is illustrated in Fig. 5. For the sake of clarity, only the origin (position)
of the task fixtures is illustrated. According to the figure, the
tolerable uncertainty pertaining to the right instrument is much
larger than that of the left instrument. Given the fact that for
a right-handed surgeon, the required range of motion for the
right instrument should normally be less limited, the solution
can be considered reasonable. However, one can always modify
the objective function for different desired results, e.g., to get
an equal tolerable uncertainty one can choose the variances to
be identical for both instruments, i.e., σR = σL = σ.
IV. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed planning
scheme, an analysis similar to the one presented in [3] is used
here. Given the preoperative CT images of four patients, the
algorithm was run for three different scenarios as follows:
1) Algorithm-Recommended Ports (ARP) Scenario: In this
scenario, the algorithm sought an optimal plan among all
feasible ICS triads with no particular preference. The decision parameters included the covariance matrices, the port
locations (and the ICS triad) as well as the configuration
of the arms.
2) Surgeon-Recommended ICS Triad (SRT) Scenario: In this
scenario, the algorithm sought an optimal plan in the ICS
triad recommended by the surgeon. The decision parameters included the covariance matrices, the port locations,
as well as the configuration of the arms.
3) Surgeon-Recommended Ports (SRP) Scenario: This scenario consisted of seeking an optimal arm configuration
for a set of ports recommended by the surgeon.
ARP, SRT, and SRP plans were sought for N = 6 and
 = 0.02 for six different patients with substantially different

geometries. The quality of the resulting ARP, SRT, and SRP
plans are compared in Fig. 7. As the figures show, ARP plans
provide the highest robustness and performance. On the other
hand, SRP plans provide the lowest robustness and performance.
In all of the cases, Monte Carlo simulations showed an actual
constraint satisfaction rate of 99%. Also, the average chance of
success in all of the cases was above 94%.
While it is in fact difficult to actually quantify the advantages
of the proposed formalism over the common practice, the results
still very well suggest that the common practice, which is solely
dependent on the surgeon’s experience, is more prone to failure.
This is particularly supported by the fact that the consideration
of the patient’s geometry and robot kinematics is too complex
that can be replaced by rough guidelines, and overlooking these
aspects of RAI can easily lead to failure. On the other hand, to
make the proposed formalism even more practically authentic,
it is designed to provide solutions that can offer some degree of
robustness to various sources of uncertainty.
Finally, according to the results of this section, the actual
chance of success is smaller than the chance of satisfaction of
individual constraints. This can be simply explained by the fact
that success is equivalent to the simultaneous satisfaction of
all constraints. Therefore, the formulation needs to be slightly
modified to enable direct control of the chance of success. However, as one may expect, the modified problem will be more
complicated.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, patient-specific preoperative planning of
robotics-assisted interventions under task uncertainty was addressed. In order to accommodate more surgeons in the planning, it is essential that the resulting plans are able to tolerate larger task uncertainties. The proposed formalism can also
accommodate other sources of uncertainty indirectly. This includes uncertainties pertaining to patient placement, tool/tissue
interaction, preoperative models, and registration error. The ultimate goal of this approach is to improve some quality indices
while keeping the chances of failure (e.g., due to intraoperative collisions and/or joint limit violations) sufficiently small.
Therefore, the planning problem was formulated as a chanceconstrained programming problem in terms of the uncertainty
of the instrument tip pose in the vicinity of the desired task
frame, maximizing the performance and tolerable uncertainty at
the task. To avoid using Monte Carlo methods for solving the

620

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. 19, NO. 2, MARCH 2015

resulting stochastic optimization problem, the unscented transform was adopted. This transformation provides a more accurate
estimation of the constraints’ distribution than a linearization
method, with far less complexity than Monte Carlo methods.
The efficacy of the proposed formulation was demonstrated by
case studies focused on optimal planning of robotics-assisted
LIMA harvesting using the da Vinci robotic system as part of
minimally invasive coronary artery bypass surgery.
The proposed stochastic formulation is based on the assumption that a given procedure can be described in terms of surgical
gestures that can be represented by task frames. This can be
likened to innovating a language of surgery whose words and
alphabets are gestures and task frames, respectively. Although
innovating such a language for more complex procedures is still
an ongoing area of research, many simpler tasks can be modeled
by a sequence of task frames by intuition. While the proposed
stochastic formalism in this paper is still computationally more
expensive than the deterministic formalism proposed [3], it is
more complete in terms of its consideration of uncertainty and
therefore can provide more accurate and reliable plans.
The formalism presented in this paper can also be modified to
accommodate other procedures, robots, and tools so long as the
assumptions made here are also applicable to those procedures,
robots, and tools. Another good example of the application of
the proposed formalism is planning for radiation therapy where
minimizing the dosage of the radiation as well as maximizing
the chance of success must be concurrently considered. In addition to its direct applications in treatment/surgical planning, the
proposed framework can also be employed to assess the eligibility of the patient, robot, and the surgeon for a given procedure.
The proposed framework can be used for improving surgical
manipulators as well as training surgeons.
It is worth noting that other decisive factors that may not have
been addressed here can also be accounted for, e.g., collision
avoidance with additional extra- or intracorporeal objects or
organs can be translated into additional deterministic or chance
constraints.
As mentioned earlier, current validation results are based on
a MATLAB implementation of the algorithm. Recently, the proposed algorithm has been implemented in 3-D Slicer (coded in
C++) (see [22]). This will not only increase the usability of such
a complex algorithm by clinicians by providing a user-friendly
interface, but will likely reduce the execution time. This will also
allow for easier adoption of GPUs and will eventually result in
a significant boost in the execution speed.
Finally, in order to realize a plan—that is either recommended
by the surgeon or selected by an algorithm—in the operating
room, a preoperative registration stage is necessary. If the mismatch between the intraoperative conditions and the preoperative model is significant, an intraoperative planning/registration
might also be deemed necessary. Since the proposed formalism
seeks plans that are less susceptible toward geometric shifts in
the targets with respect to the port locations, it is less likely
that an intraoperative registration becomes necessary whenever
a plan recommended by the formalism is adopted.
As future work, the proposed chance-constrained entropy
maximization can also be extended to a mixed-integer stochas-

tic programming problem to consider all potential ICS triads
in the planning problem in a single run. Moreover, elaborating the algorithm to incorporate surgical procedures modeled as
Markov processes can be a very interesting future extension of
the current framework.

This section outlines the forward kinematics as well as the
inverse kinematic solutions of a 6-DOF surgical instruments

to perform cardiac procedures.
