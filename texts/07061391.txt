A Directional Interstitial Antenna for Microwave
Tissue Ablation: Theoretical and
Experimental Investigation

Abstract—Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive
thermal therapy modality increasingly employed for the treatment
of tumors and benign disease. For successful treatment, complete
thermal coverage of the tumor and margin of surrounding healthy
tissue must be achieved. Currently available interstitial antennas
for MWA have cylindrically symmetric radiation patterns. Thus,
when treating targets in proximity to critical structures, caution
must be taken to prevent unintended thermal damage. A novel
coaxial antenna design for MWA with an asymmetrical cylindrical
heating pattern is presented in this paper. This radiation pattern
is achieved by employing a hemicylindrical reflector positioned at
a critical distance from a conventional coaxial monopole antenna.
Finite-element method simulations were employed to optimize the
geometric dimensions of the antenna with the objective of minimizing the antenna reflection coefficient at the 2.45-GHz operating
frequency, and maximizing volume of the ablation zone. Prototype
antennas were fabricated and experimentally evaluated. Simulations indicated an optimal S1 1 of –32 dB at 2.45 GHz in close
agreement with experimental measurements of –29 dB. Ex vivo experiments were performed to validate simulations and observe effects to the antennas’ heating pattern with the varying input power
and geometry of the reflector. Ablation zones up to 20 mm radially
were observed in the forward direction, with minimal heating (less
than 4 mm) behind the reflector.

I. INTRODUCTION
ICROWAVE ablation (MWA) is an increasingly used
thermal therapy for minimally invasive treatment of tumors and benign disease [1]. Other energy sources for thermal ablation include radiofrequency [2], lasers [3], catheterbased ultrasound applicators [4], and cyroablation [5]. Ablation
modalities employing hot sources (e.g., ferromagnetic seeds
[6], thermal conductive probes [7], and thermochemical reactions [8]) have also been investigated. These procedures may

be performed minimally invasively, typically under guidance of
ultrasound or computerized tomography, during open surgery.
MWA has found clinical applications in the treatment of tumors
in the liver [9], kidney [10], lung [11], and bone [12], as well
for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias [13], [14]. During an ablation procedure, an antenna is inserted into the target tissue
that radiates electromagnetic energy at microwave frequencies;
most currently available devices operate within frequency bands
approved for industrial, scientific, and medical use, centered at
433 MHz, 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz. Electromagnetic energy radiated from the antenna is deposited in the lossy tissue leading
to heating via dielectric hysteresis. While thermal damage following ablation is a complex function of the time–temperature
history during heating, temperatures in excess of 60 °C lead
to near-instantaneous cell death [15]. A fundamental principle
of successful ablation is the creation of an ablation zone that
sufficiently covers the entire tumor and margin of healthy tissue
to reduce chances of recurrence, while providing a margin of
safety for adjacent structures.
In most MWA procedures, the antenna is inserted into the
center of the targeted tissue, and the ablation zone grows radially outward. When ablating targets in proximity to critical
structures, caution must be taken to ensure complete thermal
coverage of the target volume, while precluding thermal damage
to nontargeted tissues. Fluid installation between the target site
and organs at risk of injury has emerged as a practical technique
for minimizing heating of nontargeted tissues [16]. Availability
of an antenna with a directional radiation pattern may simplify
the treatment of targets in proximity to critical structures without requiring fluid displacement. Conventional MWA antennas
are based on coaxial antenna designs, have axially symmetric
radiation patterns, and do not offer control of the energy deposition pattern in the angular expanse [17], [18]. Spatial control
of the energy deposition pattern is limited to control of heating
along the antenna length, achieved by employing a sleeve/choke
[19]. While multiple antennas operated as a phased-array may
offer some limited steering of power deposition, the increased
invasiveness and system complexity are drawbacks compared
to the use of single applicators [20].
Ablation antennas affording spatial control of energy deposition pattern may provide a practical and effective method for
heating tumors in proximity to critical structures. Berube and
Gauthier [21] designed a directional antenna for ablation of epicardial tissue, employing a reflector-based design and requiring
the use of an impedance matching network to match the antenna
to the transmission line. Edwards et al. [22] proposed a design

of a directional antenna by placing a microwave absorbent disposed peripherally in one direction in order to reduce the rear
radiation. Debicki et al. [23] developed a 25-mm outer diameter
(OD) 915-MHz transrectal hyperthermia device for radiating
prostate carcinomas. Their design employed a series of conductive tubes to scatter and reflect microwave energy in a direction
toward the prostate. While this device was capable of a directional radiation pattern, its large size makes it impractical for
percutaneous tumor ablation. Catheter-based ultrasound applicators operating at 6–9 MHz incorporating angular and axial
control of the spatial energy deposition pattern have been developed for interstitial and endoluminal ablation of various targets
[4], [24], [25].
This study presents a 2.45-GHz microwave antenna with a
directional power deposition pattern for tumor ablation. The
proposed device may be well suited for targeting tumors and
benign disease in proximity to critical structures such as nerves,
bowel, bladder, rectum, and the chest wall. Potential clinical
sites of interest include peripheral lung tumors, prostate tumors
[26], renal tumors in proximity to the ureter or bowel [27], and
breast tumors in proximity to the chest wall [28]. The applicator
consists of a coaxial antenna with a hemicylindrical reflector
to control the deposition of the electromagnetic energy toward
the direction of the target with minimal heating of tissue in the
reverse direction. In order to reduce the antenna dimensions,
minimize heating of the ablation applicator and cool the interfacing tissues, the coaxial antenna and reflector were inserted in
a 3.5-mm (OD) catheter filled with circulating water. The optimized antenna is well matched to tissue at 2.45 GHz and does
not require the use of an impedance matching network. Section
II details numerical simulations employed to optimize the antenna design; antenna fabrication; and experiments performed
to evaluate prototype designs in ex vivo tissue. Results from
simulations and experimental evaluations are provided in Section III. The performance of this antenna is further analyzed and
discussed in Section IV. This paper concludes with a summary
in Section V.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A simulation-based approach was employed to optimize the
design of a directional MWA applicator. The key performance
criteria during the design phase were (1) the efficient transfer
of energy into the tissue (i.e. minimizing reflected power) and
(2) ensuring a directional radiation pattern with minimal heating in the reverse direction. After determining optimal antenna
dimensions from simulations, proof-of-concept antennas were
fabricated and experimentally assessed in ex vivo porcine muscle to evaluate impedance matching, ablation zone pattern, and
transient temperature profiles.
A. Directional Antenna Design
Fig. 1 shows the schema of the proposed directional antenna
in longitudinal and transverse sections. The applicator consists
of a coaxial monopole antenna, with a hemicylindrical metallic
reflector positioned to ensure propagation of electromagnetic
energy in the forward direction. The four geometric parameters

a, b, c, and d were varied to minimize the antenna reflection coefficient (S11 ). Initial simulations suggested a low antenna reflection coefficient could be achieved when the monopole–reflector
spacing d was approximately one-tenth of the wavelength. In
order to keep d practically small while maintaining low S11 ,
a material with high dielectric constant (water, εr = 78.6 at
2.45 GHz) was employed [29]. UT-47 coaxial cable (151–0002,
Micro-coax, Philadelphia, PA, USA) was employed to implement the monopole antenna. The UT-47 cable was inserted into a
2.4-mm (OD) stainless steel tubing (McMaster-Carr, Elmhurst,
IL, USA), which served as the reflector structure. Using a custom 3-D printed bracket, the monopole was set in its optimized
location. The stainless steel tube has one end secured with adhesive to a hemostasis valve (Qosina, Edgewood, NY, USA) to
create the inflow port for water. The other end of the tube had a
section of the metal removed in the desired direction of radiation. A Y-adapter (Qosina, Edgewood, NY, USA) was connected
to the hemostasis valve to act as the outflow port for water cooling. A 3.5-mm (OD) polyimide catheter (American Durafilm,
Holliston, MA, USA) was placed over the stainless steel tube
and connected with adhesive to one end of the Y-adapter. The
distal end of the polyimide catheter was sealed with epoxy. For
these initial prototypes, total material costs were $100/antenna
and fabrication involved approximately four person hours, with
a further 24 h to allow for complete drying of adhesives.
B. FEM Frequency-Domain Model of MWA
A 3-D commercial FEM solver (COMSOL Multiphysics
v4.4, COMSOL, Inc., Burlington, MA, USA) was used to model
electromagnetic energy radiation and subsequent heating from
the directional applicator with the geometry shown in Fig. 1.
The model was employed to solve the Helmholtz electromagnetic wave equation

the coaxial line on the top of the cylinder to specify the desired
forward power. A nonuniform mesh of tetrahedral elements was
applied with finest mesh at the antenna feed boundary (maximum edge length 0.005 mm) and relatively coarser mesh in liver
tissue furthest away from the antenna (maximum edge length
4 mm). This mesh resolution was determined following iterative
adjustments to satisfy a Cauchy convergence test on the S11 , (2)

Pentium processor with 64-GB RAM operating Red Hat Linux.
A single simulation took approximately 40 min to complete.
Parametric sweeps were used to optimize the antenna dimensions (see Fig. 1) with the objective of minimizing the antenna
reflection coefficient at 2.45 GHz. The parameters a, b, and c
were varied from 1 to 10 mm in 1-mm increments, while parameter d was varied from 2.5 to 4 mm in 0.25-mm increments.
Following the optimization process, a frequency sweep was performed from 2 to 3 GHz in 100 MHz steps to characterize the
frequency response of the antenna. The power deposited by the

To approximate catheter cooling, a fixed temperature boundary
condition (20 °C) was applied on the catheter surface [33]. The
52 °C isotherm was used to approximate extents of ablation
zone following 10-min ablations in ex vivo tissue [34]. We considered perfusion values of 0 (ex vivo tissue), 3 (low perfusion
tissues such as prostate), and 10 kg/m3 /s (high perfusion tissues
such as the kidney and liver). For all in vivo simulations, blood
perfusion was reduced to 0 kg/m3 /s at tissue temperatures in
excess of 60 °C to approximate the effects of microvascular stasis. Estimates of the ablation zone for in vivo simulations were
determined using an Arrhenius model (5) [35]

For in vivo simulations, the region of ablation was approximated with the Ω = 1 threshold after 10 min of heating. Fig. 2
illustrates the dimensions of the ablation zone assessed to evaluate the directionality of candidate antenna designs. For nominal antenna designs, the reflector geometry was a half cylinder
(θ = 90). Further simulations were performed varying θ from
10° to 110° in 10° increments. The extents of the ablation zone
were characterized by the dimensions r (radial extent of the
ablation zone in the forward direction), r’ (radial extent of the
ablation zone in the reverse direction), and w (width of the ablation zone), as shown in Fig. 2. We considered applied power
levels of 50 and 80 W, 10-min heating durations. Simulations
were employed to determine the impact of the reflector enclosure around the antenna on the reflection coefficient and heating
pattern.

for fabricated antennas was measured using an HP 8753D vector
network analyzer. Measurements were conducted with room
temperature circulating tap water with the antenna inserted to
a depth of at least 50 mm in ex vivo porcine muscle. Heating
experiments in ex vivo porcine tissue were performed with an
input power of 50 and 80 W using the fabricated antennas to
compare to simulation. Porcine muscle samples, enclosed within
water-sealed bags, were heated to ∼30 °C in a temperaturecontrolled water bath. Fiber optic temperature probes (Neoptix
RFX-04–1, Canada) were placed as shown in Fig. 2. Room
temperature tap water was circulated through the antenna at a
flow rate of 5 ml/s with a peristaltic pump (Cole-Parmer, 7554–
90, Vernon Hills, IL, USA). Fig. 3 illustrates the experimental
setup for ex vivo ablations in porcine tissue.
Five experimental ablations were performed for each input
power of 50 and 80 W applied for 10 min. Following ablations,
tissue samples were sliced perpendicular to the length of the
antenna at the depth that was approximately the position of the
tip of the monopole to measure and photograph the area of tissue
ablation.

This study was undertaken to design a minimally invasive
interstitial antenna with a directional radiation pattern for microwave tissue ablation. The proposed antenna design includes
a highly conductive reflector to limit radiation in the reverse direction. A simulation-based approach was employed to optimize
the antenna dimensions with the goal of minimizing reflected
power at 2.45-GHz operating frequency. Proof-of-concept antennas were fabricated and their electromagnetic and heating
performances were evaluated in ex vivo tissue.
Initial simulations indicated a relationship between the critical spacing parameter d and the wavelength within the material
between the reflector and the monopole antenna. The optimized
antenna employed water (εr = 78 at 2.45 GHz) as the material between the reflector and the monopole antenna to reduce
the critical spacing parameter d, allowing for a constructive interference to occur while also maintaining a relatively small
size. Simulations indicated an optimal value of d = 1.2 (mm)
yielding an S11 of –32 dB at 2.45 GHz. From 2 to 3 GHz,
the experimentally measured S11 of the proof-of-concept antenna exhibited good agreement with simulations (see Fig. 4).
Other high dielectric constant materials (e.g., titanium dioxide,
εr ∼ 100) may be suitable for further reducing the size of the
proposed antenna design. Besides serving as a high dielectric
constant coupling material, circulating water also provides cooling of the catheter shaft, thereby mitigating undesirable heating
along the antenna length.
To assess the effect of the reflector geometry on the antenna
performance, we evaluated designs with θ varying from 10° to
110°. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the antenna reflection coefficient
is minimized (S11 = −39 dB) when θ = 90°. Good impedance
matching (S11 ≤ –20 dB, i.e., forward power greater than 99%)
is maintained for reflector designs with 60° < θ < 100°. Furthermore, the radial extent of the ablation zone in the forward
direction (r) remains fairly constant for θ < 40°. The width (w)
and radial extent of the ablation zone in the reverse direction (r’)
decrease with increasing θ. Simulations indicated that reflectors
encompassing a greater extent of the angular expanse (larger
θ) yield a more focused heating pattern with minimal heating
in the reverse direction. Decreasing θ led to slight increases in
heating in the forward direction at the expense of greater backward heating. The value of θ had minimal impact on the heating
pattern along the length of the antenna. The optimal value of
θ can be selected based on the requirements for specific clinical applications by trading off antenna reflection coefficient,
width of ablation zone, and radial extent of the ablation zone
in the forward/reverse directions. One potential application is
for heating prostate targets with interstitial applicators. Due to
the number of sensitive structures in proximity to the prostate
(neurovascular bundle, bladder, and rectum), the 90° applicator may be preferable due to the limited backward heating. For

MCWILLIAMS et al.: DIRECTIONAL INTERSTITIAL ANTENNA FOR MICROWAVE TISSUE ABLATION

endoluminal targeting of prostate structures, further design and
optimization of antennas is needed.
The observed shapes of experimental ablation zones were in
good agreement with patterns predicted by models. For the 90°
antenna, increasing applied power from 50 to 80 W, yielded on
average a 2 mm increase in radial extent of the ablation zone
in good agreement with model predictions (4.25 mm increase
predicted by simulations). However, no changes in width of experimental ablation zones were observed. Both models (4 mm)
and experiments (2.2 mm) indicated increases in r for the 70°
antenna compared to the 90° antenna. Ablation zones with the
70° antenna exhibited minimal charring of tissue. All experimental ablation zones with the 90° indicated charred tissue in
the forward tissue. These observations support the hypothesis
that increasing θ leads to more focused heating, while decreasing θ leads to larger ablation zones at the expense of greater
reverse heating. Temperature measurements during ex vivo ablations for a 70° further demonstrated directionality of heating.
Peak temperature rise 10 mm in the forward direction on average reached 93.7±2.5 °C compared to ∼11.1±4 °C observed
5 mm in the reverse direction.
While currently available devices for MWA do not offer directional control of heating, catheter-based ultrasound technology
has been extensively characterized and affords dynamic control of heating profiles along the applicator length and angular
expanse [22], [23], [32]. Results from in vivo simulations with
the directional microwave antenna indicate radial extents of the
ablation zone up to 16–21 mm similar to ablation zone sizes
that can be achieved with catheter-based ultrasound devices.
Ultrasound technologies also afford dynamic control of heating
along the length of applicators not currently feasible with the
proposed directional microwave antenna. A potential benefit of
the directional microwave antenna design is the relatively simpler fabrication process, in comparison to ultrasound technologies that require independent feeding of individual transducers
and degassed circulating water [4], [25], [36].
Clinicians specializing in cancer therapy seek nonsurgical,
minimally invasive techniques which provide eradication of tumor cells with preservation of nondiseased surrounding tissue
or sensitive structures such as nerves. Currently, this demand is
met by percutaneous ablation with microwave antennas via image guidance such as computed tomography or ultrasound. The
technical considerations of subjecting a tumor to cytotoxic temperatures may prove difficult as navigation of a device to within
or just beyond the tumor is not always anatomically possible.
Operator control of the ablation zone by directional targeting
of tumor has the potential to improve the clinical outcomes,
safety, efficiency, and cost of tumor ablation treatment. Current ablation devices require a direct approach for intratumoral
placement of the antenna. With directional ablation capability,
clinicians could alter the angle of approach to lesions that are situated adjacent to critical structures (see Fig. 8). Even a slightly
different trajectory could be crucial in avoiding intrinsic damage to liver, lung, and other organs, as well as avoiding thermal
damage to adjacent structures such as bowel, blood vessels, or
nerves. More so, directional technology could potentially allow
an alternate, safe percutaneous window for treatment of lesions

that were previously inaccessible. Electromagnetic and camerabased needle-tracking and guidance technology may be suitable
for estimating applicator coordinates (x, y, z) and orientation
(roll, pitch, and yaw) with ultrasound and CT guidance [37],
[38], [39]. Another potential solution is to augment the device
with fiducial paint, visible on CT, to indicate device orientation.
A limitation of the applicator design presented in this study
is the relatively large diameter (OD = 3.5 mm). Reduction
of the applicator diameter may be achieved by using smaller
coaxial cables, implementing the reflector directly on a catheter
inner-wall, and exploring the use of low-loss, high dielectric
constant ceramics (e.g., titanium dioxide). With further design
optimization, it is possible that directional antennas may find
the right niche as an adjunctive or alternate tool for difficult
tumor locations. In current form, the relatively small ablation zone diameter places restrictions on targets that may be
treated with the proposed technology. Future studies will investigate elevated power levels and the use of low-loss materials within the catheter to increase power deposition within
tissue.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we utilized a simulation-based approach to design and optimize an interstitial MWA antenna with a directional
radiation pattern. Proof-of-concept antennas were fabricated and
experiments were conducted to evaluate their reflection coefficient and heating performance in ex vivo porcine tissue. Simulations and experimental data showed good agreement for the
broadband antenna reflection coefficient and the antenna heating
pattern. Experimentally measured transient temperature profiles
indicated significantly more rapid heating to larger temperatures
in the forward direction, with temperature rise in the reverse direction limited to 15 °C. Furthermore, measurements of the
volume of ablation showed that varying the enclosure and input
power only marginally increased the penetration depth characterized by the parameter r. Further studies will need to be
performed to further characterize the effects of the reflectors’
geometry on the radiation pattern and to reduce the effects associated to the water cooling of the antenna. The modeling and
optimization techniques presented in this paper can be extended
