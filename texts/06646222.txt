Abstract—Repeated X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans
are often required in several specific applications such as perfusion
imaging, image-guided biopsy needle, image-guided intervention,
and radiotherapy with noticeable benefits. However, the associated
cumulative radiation dose significantly increases as comparison
with that used in the conventional CT scan, which has raised major
concerns in patients. In this study, to realize radiation dose reduction by reducing the X-ray tube current and exposure time (mAs)
in repeated CT scans, we propose a prior-image induced nonlocal (PINL) regularization for statistical iterative reconstruction
via the penalized weighted least-squares (PWLS) criteria, which
we refer to as “PWLS-PINL”. Specifically, the PINL regularization utilizes the redundant information in the prior image and the
weighted least-squares term considers a data-dependent variance
estimation, aiming to improve current low-dose image quality. Subsequently, a modified iterative successive overrelaxation algorithm
is adopted to optimize the associative objective function. Experimental results on both phantom and patient data show that the
present PWLS-PINL method can achieve promising gains over the
other existing methods in terms of the noise reduction, low-contrast
object detection, and edge detail preservation.
Index Terms—Penalized weighted least-squares, prior image,
regularization, statistical iterative reconstruction (SIR), X-ray
computed tomography (CT).

I. INTRODUCTION
-RAY computed tomography (CT) techniques have
been widely explored for specific applications in clinic
including perfusion imaging, image-guided biopsy needle,
image-guided intervention, and radiotherapy with noticeable
benefits [1]–[4]. Under these situations, repeated tomographic
acquisitions are often prescribed. For instance, in the case of interventional imaging, a patient may undergo one or more imaging studies prior to the current image acquisition, whereas in
other cases such as in daily CBCT examinations for target localization in image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), repeated
scans have become routine procedures. Despite the achievements of the repeated CT scans, the cumulative radiation dose
still significantly increases as comparison with that used in the
conventional CT scans [5], which has raised major concerns in
patients. Reducing the radiation exposure is one of the major
efforts in the CT fields [6]–[9]. It is known that lowering the
X-ray tube current and /or shortening the exposure time (mAs)
in CT scan would be a simple and cost-effective method to reduce radiation exposure. However, the associated image usually
suffers from serious noise induced artifacts due to the excessive
quantum noise if adequate treatment on the noisy measurement
is not applied.
Up to now, various techniques have been investigated, including optimal scan protocols [7]–[9] and advanced image reconstruction algorithms [10]–[14], to reduce radiation dose in
CT scans. Among them, the statistical iterative reconstruction
(SIR) methods [12], [13], which take into account the statistical noise properties of the measurement and accommodate
the imaging geometry, have shown great potential to reduce the
quantum noise and artifacts as comparison with the filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction method [15]. A major drawback
of the SIR methods is the computational burden associated with
the multiple reprojection and back-projection operation cycles
through the image domain. However, with the development of
fast computers and dedicated hardware [16], [17], the modified
SIR methods have been used recently in advanced CT equipments [13], [18].
Generally, the SIR methods can be derived from the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator given the observed data
or measurement, which usually consist of two terms in the associative objective function. Specifically, the first term, named
as the “data-fidelity term,” models the statistical measurement;
and the second term, named as the “image prior” or “regularization term,” penalizes the solution. The data-fidelity term

incorporating an accurate statistical modeling of the measurement is a prerequisite of the SIR algorithms [11]–[13], [18] and
the edge-preserving regularization term plays an important role
in the successful image reconstruction. Usually, the regularization term is chosen as a shift-invariant function that penalizes the
differences among local neighboring pixels. These regularizations through equally smoothing both the noise and edge details
often tend to produce an unfavorable oversmoothing effect [12].
In contrast to the smooth regularization, many edge-preserving
regularizations/priors were proposed in the literature [11], [22].
A typical example is the Huber prior [19]–[21], which replaces
the quadratic penalty function with a nonquadratic penalty function that increases less rapidly compared with the quadratic
penalty function for sufficiently large arguments. However,
these edge-preserving regularizations/priors mostly rely on the
properties of the local smoothness or edges and do not consider the basic affinity structure information of the desired image, such as the gray levels, edge indicator, dominant direction,
and dominant frequency. To address the aforementioned issues
of the conventional regularizations/priors, an edge-preserving
nonlocal (NL) prior was proposed for CT and positron emission tomography image reconstructions with encouraging results [22]–[24] by fully exploiting the density difference information and the nonlocal connectivity and continuity information
of the desired image.
With regard to the repeated CT scans, a previously scanned
high-quality diagnostic CT image volume usually contains same
anatomical information with the current scan except for some
anatomical changes due to internal motion or patient weight
change. Generally, the CT scans at different times are often
dealt independently and no systematic attempt has been made
to integrate the valuable patient-specific prior knowledge, i.e.,
the previous scanned data that hold a wealth of prior information on the patient-specific anatomy, to promote the subsequent
imaging process. Undoubtedly, performing a low-dose protocol in the follow-up CT scan by fully using the previous image
into the current image reconstruction framework, is a promising
and interesting research topic [25], [28], [29], [31], [34]. For
instance, Chen et al. proposed a prior image constrained compressed sensing (PICCS) algorithm [29] to enable view angle
undersampling by integrating a prior image into the reconstruction procedure. Lauzier extended the PICCS algorithm to the
DR-PICCS algorithm [30] for CT radiation dose reduction using a statistical model. A weakness of PICCS is that the prior and
current images are taken at the same global geometrical coordinates. This assumption, however, does not necessarily translate
into practical settings like in the IGRT applications. Accurate
registration and voxel consistency may limit the wide use of the
PICCS algorithm. To address this issue, Ma et al. [10] proposed
a low-dose CT image filtering method (named as “ndiNLM” algorithm) by utilizing a high-quality normal-dose scan as priori
information to perform current low-dose CT image restoration
based on nonlocal means criteria [26]. The ndiNLM algorithm
performed well in noise reduction, but actually it is a postprocessing approach without considering the statistical property of
the CT projection data. Another strategy that relaxes image registration was the dictionary learning-based approach proposed

by Xu et al. [34], which was derived with the consideration of
sparse representation theory via a sparse linear combination of
the patch-based atoms in the dictionary.
In this paper, we aim to lower mAs for radiation reduction
in the case of repeated CT scans and propose a prior-image
induced nonlocal (PINL) regularization for SIR via the penalized weighted least-squares (PWLS) criteria, which we refer
to as “PWLS-PINL.” Specifically, the present PINL regularization utilizes the redundant information in the prior-image
and the weighted least-squares term considers a data-dependent
variance estimation, aiming to improve current low-dose image
quality. Subsequently, a modified iterative successive overrelation algorithm is adopted to optimize the associative objective
function.
II. METHODS AND MATERIALS
A. PWLS Criteria for CT Image Reconstruction
Mathematically, the X-ray CT measurement can be approximately expressed as a discrete linear system
y = Hμ

(1)

where μ denotes the vector of attenuation coefficients, i.e.,
μ = (μ1 , μ2 , . . . , μN ) , and y represents the obtained sinogram
data (projections after system calibration and logarithm transformation), i.e., y = (y1 , y2 , . . . , yM ) , where “ ” denotes the
matrix transpose. The operator H represents the system or projection matrix with a M × N size. The element of Hij denotes
the length of intersection of projection ray i with pixel j. In
our implementation, the associated element was precalculated
by a fast ray-tracing technique [32] and stored as a file. The
goal of CT image reconstruction is to estimate the attenuation
coefficients μ from the measurement y.
According to the measurement model (1) and the MAP estimation criterion [12], [33], the mathematical formula for PWLS
image reconstruction with a regularization term R(μ) can be expressed as


(2)
μ∗ = arg min (y − Hμ) Σ−1 (y − Hμ) + βR(μ)
μ≥0

where Σ is a diagonal matrix with the ith element of σi2 which
is the variance of sinogram data y. β is a hypeparameter that
controls the strength of regularization.
To determine the parameter σi2 in (2), several methods can be
used [12], [34]. In this study, the variance of σi2 was determined
by the mean-variance relationship proposed by Ma et al. [27],
which is written as


2
2
σi (y) =
exp(p̄i ) 1 +
exp(p̄i )(σe − 1.25)
(3)
I0
I0
where I0 denotes the incident X-ray intensity, p̄i is the mean of
sinogram data y at bin i, and σe2 is the background electronic
noise variance.
B. Overview of the PINL regularization
Traditionally, R(μ) in (2) is designed by a simple weighted
sum of the potential function on the different values of the

ZHANG et al.: ITERATIVE RECONSTRUCTION FOR X-RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY

neighboring pixels in the image domain [12] and can be described as


R(μj ) =
w(k, j)ϕ(μj − μk ) (4)
R(μ) =
j

j

k ∈S j

where index j runs over all image elements in the image domain, Sj represents the local neighborhood of the jth image
pixel in two dimensions, and ϕ denotes a convex and positive
potential function satisfying ϕ(0) = 0. Weight w(k, j) is positive and symmetric, i.e., w(k, j) ≥ 0 and w(k, j) = w(j, k),
which are usually designed as an inverse proportion of the distance between the pixels k and j in Sj . These regularizations
are inherently local because they lack global connectivity or
continuity.
In the repeated CT scans, a previously scanned normal-dose
CT image has lower noise level and higher resolution than the
current low-dose CT image, and majority of the anatomical information are same between the two scans. Thus, in this paper,
to utilize fully the redundancy of information in the prior image,
we propose a prior-image induced nonlocal (PINL) regularization with quadratic potential function, which can be written as
 
2
w(k, j)(μj − μreg
(5)
RPINL (μ) =
prior,k )
j

k ∈N j

where μreg
prior denotes the registered prior image between the
prior image μprior and the current low-dose image μ, Nj denotes
the search window in the image μreg
prior . The nonlocal weight
w(k, j) between the prior image and the current objective image
is defined as

exp(−D(k, j)/h2 )
(6)
w(k, j) = exp(−D(k, j)/h2 )/

the registered prior image from the initial high-dose CT image. The effectiveness of the B-spline-based image registration
algorithm has been extensively validated by many registration
experiments. Based on the transformation matrix, all voxels of
the prior CT images are then transformed into the current CT
images to obtain globally aligned prior images. Similar to our
previous studies in low-dose CT image restoration [10], through
two roughly aligned images, the rich redundant information in
the prior image can be effectively used to induce the PINL regularization for low-dose image reconstruction. Further evaluation
of image registration in our study is presented in Section III-A5.
After we obtained the registered prior image μreg
prior , weight
w(k, j) in (6) can be regarded as a function of the current estimation μ and the registered prior image μreg
prior . Because of
the nonlinearity in calculating weight w(k, j), minimizing the
objective function of (9) is difficult for a closed solution. To
address this problem, based on our previous studies [23], [28],
a binary optimal scheme can be used to minimize the objective
function of (9). Specifically, weight w(k, j) is automatically adjusted according to the similarity between the patch-windows
in the current estimation μn (n is the iterative index) and the
registered prior image μreg
prior during each iteration.
In this study, we modified the iterative successive overrelaxation algorithm described in [12] and [38] to calculate the
solution of (9). In the implementation, the variance σi2 , i.e., the
element of weight matrix in (9), is updated in each iteration
according to (3) for a more accurate estimation of the sinogram variance. For simplicity, we call our implementation as
the PWLS-PINL algorithm, and similar to [12], [38], it can be
summarized as follows:
1 Initialization

k ∈N j
2
D(k, j) = μ(nj ) − μreg
prior (nk )2

2369

(7)

reg
μ(nj ) = {μl : l ∈ nj }, μreg
prior (nk ) = {μprior,l : l ∈ nk }. (8)

Here, weight w(k, j) is a decreasing function of the similarity
between two local neighborhoods nk and nj (named patchwindow) centered at the pixel k in the image domain of μreg
prior
and the pixel j in the image domain of μ, respectively. ·22
represents the 2-D Euclidean distance between two similarity patch-windows. μ(nj ) and μreg
prior (nk ) denote the vector of
neighborhood pixel values restricted in the patch-windows nj
and nk , respectively, and h is a parameter that controls the decay
of the exponential function.
In summary, the objective function of the PWLS with the
present PINL regularization (i.e., PWLS-PINL) for CT image
reconstruction can be rewritten as


μ∗ = arg min (y − Hμ) Σ−1 (y − Hμ) + βRPINL (μ) . (9)

C. Implementation of the PWLS-PINL Method
In the implementation of the present PWLS-PINL method,
the current CT images and the initial high-dose CT images are
first reconstructed by the FBP method, and then a B-splinebased image registration technique [37] is adopted to generate

D. Data Acquisition
1) Anthropomorphic Torso Phantom: An anthropomorphic
torso phantom (Radiology Support Devices, Inc., Long Beach,
CA, USA) was used for the experimental data acquisition, as
shown in Fig. 1(a). The phantom was scanned by a clinical CT
scanner (Siemens SOMATOM Sensation 16 CT) at three exposure levels, i.e., 17, 40, 100 mAs. For each exposure level, the
tube voltage was set at 120 kVp and the phantom was scanned
in a cine mode at a fixed bed position. Fig. 1(b) shows the
CT image reconstructed by the FBP method with an optimized
Hamming filter from the sinogram data acquired at 100 mAs,
120 kVp. The deformed images were simulated by mechanically performing a cosine transform warped distortion on the
images reconstructed by the FBP method from the sinogram
data acquired at 100 mAs, 120 kVp. To obtain the registered
prior images, the deformed images were registered to the images reconstructed by the FBP method from the sinogram data
acquired at 17 and 40 mAs, respectively.
2) Numerical XCAT Phantom: To evaluate the influence of
mismatch between the prior and current images on the performance of the PWLS-PINL and PICCS methods, the XCAT
phantom [39] was used to simulate the normal-dose and lowdose CT image volumes with the same anatomical structures.
The associated projection data were simulated using a CT simulator [39] at two exposure levels, i.e., 232 and 23.2 mAs. For
each exposure level, the tube voltage was set at 120 kVp, the time
per gantry rotation was 1.0 s, the slice thickness was 3.0 mm.
The system geometry represented a system with 1800 mm
source-to-detector distance, 1510.4 mm center-to-source distance, and 0.8448 mm detector pixels (672 radial bins). Reconstructions were made onto an image volume with the size of
512 × 512 × 100.
3) Patient Data: The patient data were obtained with a patient consent for a chest CT study for medical reasons. The
experimental data were acquired by the Siemens SOMATOM
Sensation 16 CT scanner. The scanning parameters were as follows: the pitch was 1.0 mm, the time per gantry rotation was

m =1

Q

|μm − μQ |2

m =1

|μGS,m |2

(12)

where μ represents the reconstructed image from the low-dose
sinogram data, and μGS denotes a golden standard image, m
indicates the voxel index in the region of interest (ROI), Q
is the number of voxels in the ROI, and μ̄ denotes the mean
voxel value in the ROI. In this study, the golden standard image
is reconstructed by the FBP method with ramp filter from the
averaged sinogram data of 150 times repeated scans at 100 mAs,
120 kVp.
2) Evaluation by Image Similarity: To explore the performance of the various algorithms at the local detail level, the
universal quality index (UQI) [40] was utilized to conduct an
ROI-based analysis by evaluating the degree of similarity between the reconstructed and golden standard images. Given a
selected ROI at the corresponding locations in the two images,
the mean, variance, and covariance of intensities in the ROI can
be respectively calculated as
μ̄ =

where μGS denotes a golden standard image, m is the voxel

Then, the UQI can be calculated as follows:
UQI =

UQI measures the intensity similarity between the two images, and its value ranges from zero to one. A UQI value closer
to one suggests better similarity to the golden standard image.
3) Evaluation by Contrast-to-Noise Ratio: For quantitative
evaluation of the reconstructed images, we selected two different ROIs as indicated by the red squares in Table III for the
calculation of the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). The CNR is
defined as
|μ̄ROI − μ̄BG |
(17)
CNR =  2
2
σROI + σBG
where μ̄ROI is the mean of the voxels inside the ROI, and μ̄BG
the mean of the voxels in the background. σROI and σBG are
the standard deviations of the voxel values inside the ROI and
the background region, respectively.
F. Comparison Methods
To validate and evaluate the performance of the present
PWLS-PINL method, the FBP method using ramp filter, the
NL-prior-based PWLS (PWLS-NL) method [23], [24], the
PICCS method [29], [30] and a global dictionary-based statistical iterative reconstruction (GDSIR) approach [34] were
adopted for comparison. The NL-prior term in the PWLS-NL
approach is expressed as
 
w(k, j)(μj − μk )2
(18)
RNL (μ) =
j

k ∈N j

where in weight w(k, j) is defined as


w(k, j) = exp − μ(nj ) − μ(nk )22 /h2
μ(nj ) = {μl : l ∈ nj },

(19)

μ(nk ) = {μ : l ∈ nk } (20)

where nj and nk represent the patch-windows, and Nj denotes
the search window in the current low-dose CT image domain.
The PICCS algorithm under the PWLS framework can be
formulated as [30]:
μ∗ = arg min[αΨ1 (μ − μprior )1 + (1 − α)Ψ2 (μ)1 ]
μ≥0

λ
(y − Hμ) Σ−1 (y − Hμ).
(21)

where μprior is the prior image, Ψ1 and Ψ2 are the sparsifying
transforms, and α ∈ [0, 1] is a scalar that controls the relative
weights to be allocated to the prior image and compressing
sensing terms. x1 represents the l1 -norm defined as x1 =

i |xi |. In the implementation, the sparsifying transform used
for both Ψ1 and Ψ2 is the image spatial gradient norm, which is
also equivalent to the total variation (TV).
The GDSIR is a patch-based approach by extracting the prior
information via a global dictionary trained from a high-quality
image [34], and the associative image reconstruction is equivalent to solve the following minimization problem:

algorithm [35] wherein an orthogonal matching pursuit technique [36] was used for sparse representation. Additionally, an

to find the solution of (22).
III. RESULTS
A. Anthropomorphic Torso Phantom Study
1) Noise and Artifacts Suppression: Figs. 2 and 3 show the
results reconstructed by five different methods from the sinogram data acquired at 17 and 40 mAs, respectively. Figs. 2(a)
and 3(a) show the images reconstructed by the FBP method
with ramp filter. Serious noise-induced streak artifacts can be
observed. Figs. 2(b) and 3(b) show the images reconstructed by
the PWLS-NL method. The noise was mostly suppressed, but
undesired streak artifacts can still be observed in the highly attenuated regions, partially because of the properties of nonlocal
weight calculations for structuring preserving. Figs. 2(c) and

3(c) show the images reconstructed by the PICCS method using
Fig. 1(b) as the prior image. The PICCS method can yield reasonable images with sharp edges. Further, the smooth regions
are plagued by some streak artifacts, which may have resulted
from the TV processing. In the context of medical imaging,
this noise might result in some deceptive structures. Figs. 2(d)
and 3(d) show the images reconstructed by the GDSIR method
wherein the global dictionary was trained from the normal-dose
image Fig. 1(b). It can be seen that some distortions occurred
in the case of 17 mAs while satisfactory result appeared with
noticeable noise reduction in the case of 40 mAs. Figs. 2(e) and
3(e) show the images reconstructed by the present PWLS-PINL
method wherein the prior image is the same as that used in the
PICCS and GDSIR methods. The PWLS-PINL method achieves
more gains over the PICCS and GDSIR methods in terms of
successful noise-induced artifacts suppression and edges detail
preservation. Fig. 4 depicts the associated horizontal profiles
located at the voxel position y = 277 and x from 425 to 445
as indicated by the red line in Fig. 1(b). The profiles from
the present PWLS-PINL method agree much better with those
from the normal-dose scan compared with those from the other
methods.
To further evaluate quantitatively the present PWLS-PINL
method, the lSNR and rRMSE of the three different ROIs, as
indicated by the squares in Fig. 1(b), were measured in the two
cases of 17 and 40 mAs, and are listed in Tables I and II. All
statistical model-based methods, i.e., the PWLS-NL, PICCS,

GDSIR, and PWLS-PINL, yielded more gains over the FBP reconstructions from the same sinogram data in terms of the lSNR
and rRMSE measures in the three different ROIs. The results
partially demonstrate that the present PWLS-PINL method can
achieve noticeable gains over the other methods in terms of noise
and artifacts suppression. However, the PICCS method is superior to the present PWLS-PINL algorithm in terms of the lSNR

the reconstructed image.
2) UQI Measure: Figs. 5 and 7 show the zoomed details of
the four ROIs in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. The PWLS-PINL
method achieves significant gains over the other methods in
terms of the resolution preservation. The corresponding UQI
scores are shown in Figs. 6 and 8, respectively. The PWLSPINL method yields higher UQI scores (more than 0.98) than
the other methods in both the cases of 17 and 40 mAs.

3) CNR Measure: Table III shows the CNRs of the images
reconstructed by the four different methods from the sinogram
data at 17 and 40 mAs. The ROIs for the CNR measure are
marked by two squares in the figure located at the top left
corner of Table III. Evidently, the present PWLS-PINL method
can achieve significant ability for region contrast identification,
which is very important for low-dose CT image reconstruction.
4) Convergence Analysis of the PWLS-PINL Algorithm: To
validate and analyze the convergence of the present PWLSPINL method, global rRMSE and SNR measures on the entire to-be-reconstructed anthropomorphic torso phantom image
were performed. Fig. 9 shows the rRMSE and SNR measures
with respect to the number of iterations in the two cases of 17
and 40 mAs. The results show that the present PWLS-PINL
algorithm can yield a steadily convergence solution in terms of
the global rRMSE and SNR measurements.

5) Influence of Image Registration Accuracy on the PWLSPINL Method: To evaluate the influence of the image registration accuracy on the performance of the PWLS-PINL method,
we used an elastically deformed FBP image from the original
one reconstructed from the sinogram data acquired at 100 mAs,
120 kVp and the corresponding registered image by the
B-spline-based registration algorithm as the prior images to induce image reconstruction by the PWLS-PINL method. Fig. 10
shows the influence of the registration accuracy on the PWLSPINL method in the low-dose image reconstruction from the
sinogram data acquired at 17 mAs, 120 kVp. Figs. 10(a) and (b)
show the elastic deformed FBP image and the corresponding
registered FBP image, respectively. The deformation between
the two images is significant. Fig. 10(c) shows the image reconstructed by the PWLS-PINL method using Fig. 10(a) as the prior
image. Fig. 10(d) shows the image reconstructed by the PWLSPINL method using Fig. 10(b) as the prior image. For both the
reconstructions of Fig. 10(c) and (d), h was 2.0 ×10−3 and β
was 2.0 × 104 . Fig. 10(e) shows the corresponding difference
image between Figs. 10(c) and 2(a). Fig. 10(f) shows the corresponding difference image between Fig. 10(d) and 2(a). These
difference images indicate that the performance of the PWLSPINL method is not sensitive to the deformed prior image when
a large search window N is used to minimize the influence of
the misregistration. In other words, the present PWLS-PINL

method does not heavily depend on the prior image registration
accuracy. In practice, a rough registration may be sufficient.
B. Numerical XCAT Phantom Study
The adjacent slices of the normal-dose images were used
as the prior image to induce the desired-image reconstruction
by the PICCS and PWLS-PINL methods from the low-dose
sinogram data. Figs. 11 and 12 show the resultant influence of
mismatch between the two different prior images and the desired

images on the PWLS-PINL and PICCS methods, respectively.
Figs. 11(a) and 12(a) show the FBP images reconstructed with
ramp filter from the low-dose sinogram data; Figs. 11(b) and
12(b) show the unregistered prior images reconstructed from
the normal-dose sinogram data by the FBP method with ramp
filter. The bone structure at the top of Fig. 11(a) does not appear in Fig. 11(b), but appears large in Fig. 12(b) due to the
different slice selections. These kinds of features were used to
analyze the influence of prior information on the desired-image
reconstruction. Figs. 11(c) and 12(c) show the images reconstructed by the PICCS method from the low-dose sinogram data
using Figs. 11(b) and 12(b) as the prior image, respectively. The
zoomed ROIs at the bottom of each subfigure show the pseudoboundaries from the PICCS method. The results suggest that
some local mismatches between the prior and current images
may propagate into the desired image. However, Figs. 11(d)
and 12(d) show that the PWLS-PINL method with the same
prior image can deal with the mismatches between the prior
and current images. These results indicate that the performance
of the PWLS-PINL method is not sensitive to the mismatched
prior images when a relatively large search window is used to
minimize the influence of the mismatch regions. In other words,
the present PWLS-PINL method does not heavily depend on the
prior-image mismatch accuracy, and a rough registration may
be sufficient in practice.
For the low-contrast detectability, as shown in Fig. 11(c)III and 11(d)-III, the PICCS method appears to perform better
than the PWLS-PINL method in the matched regions. However, as shown in the zoomed ROI of Figs. 11(c) and 12(c), the
PWLS-PINL method outperforms the PICCS method when the
low contrast features in the desired-image are different from
those in the prior image.
C. Patient Study
Fig. 13 shows the chest CT images reconstructed by five different methods from two different sinogram data. Fig. 13(a)
shows the image reconstructed by the FBP method with ramp
filter from the sinogram data acquired at 200 mAs, 120 kVp,
which was used as the prior image for the PWLS-PINL, PICCS,
and GDSIR methods. Fig. 13(b) shows the image reconstructed
by the FBP with ramp filter from the sinogram data acquired at
20 mAs, 120 kVp. The anatomical structures between two FBP
images are mostly similar except some noticeable organ elastic deformation as indicated by the rectangles in Fig. 13(a) and
(b) because of the heteronomous breathing or heartbeat. The
noise-induced streak artifacts can be observed in Fig. 13(b).
Fig. 13(c) shows the image reconstructed by the PWLS-NL
method from the sinogram data acquired at 20 mAs, 120 kVp.
Fig. 13(d) shows the image reconstructed by the PICCS method
using Fig. 13(a) as the prior image. Most of the noise is mitigated by the TV term of the PICCS objective function, whereas
some deceptive structures appear in the mismatched areas. This
phenomenon suggests that the edge structure in the prior images may have been passed to the current images. Fig. 13(e)
shows the image reconstructed by the GDSIR method from
the sinogram data acquired at 20 mAs, 120 kVp. The global

It can be seen that most of the noise is removed without introducing new fake structure, but noticeable streak artifacts still exist.
Fig. 13(f) shows the image reconstructed by the PWLS-PINL
method from the sinogram data acquired at 20 mAs, 120 kVp. To
illustrate further the performance of the PWLS-based methods,

the present PWLS-PINL method can achieve significant gains
over the other methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy by
visual inspection. In the implementation of the four PWLSbased methods, the FBP image reconstructed with ramp filter,
i.e., Fig. 13(b) was used as the initial image. All the parameters
were selected by visual inspection for eye-appealing results, together with the normal-dose FBP image [see i.e., Fig. 13(a)] for
comparison.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Prior information is useful for successful PWLS-based image
reconstruction [11], [22]–[24], [28]. In the medical clinic, several situations exist where repeated tomographic acquisitions are
prescribed. In these cases, substantial similarity exists among
images in the acquisition sequence. As a result, a previously
scanned normal-dose CT image may provide strong prior information for subsequent iterative image reconstruction from the
projection data with a low-dose protocol. For example, Chen
et al. [29] proposed the PICCS method for CT iterative image
reconstruction from the spare-view measurements using a highquality reference image. Ma et al. [10] proposed the ndiNLM
filter for low-dose CT image restoration using the previously
scanned CT image without requiring the accurate image registration processing due to its patch-based search mechanism.
In this paper, we have proposed a prior-image induced nonlocal regularization term for PWLS image reconstruction, which
was named as the “PWLS-PINL.” Preliminary results using
both phantom and patient data suggested that the present algorithm can robustly incorporate redundant information from
previously acquired images without requiring accurate image
registration, as discussed in Section III-A5. Moreover, a substantial improvement in image quality was observed compared
with the traditional methods if the prior images were not incorporated. The present algorithm can be applied to the scenario
where sequences of tomographic data are acquired, such as lung
nodule surveillance, image-guided biopsy needle, and volumetric CBCT imaging during a radiation therapy course. Because
the prior image may be offset or rotated with respect to the
anatomy at the time of imaging, a coarse registration should
be applied in the implementation of the present PWLS-PINL
method aiming to reduce the computational burden with a selected median size search window. Practically, due to the registration accuracy depending on the dose in CT scan [42], some
robust registration techniques should be adopted to improve the
registration accuracy with a low-dose CT imaging.
In this study, two prior image-based methods were explored
for comparison, i.e., the PICCS and GDSIR. The PICCS and

PWLS-PINL methods can be regarded as a voxel updating technique while the GDSIR method is a patch updating technique.
As shown in Section-III, the PICCS method cannot achieve satisfactory performance in suppressing noise-induced artifacts as
the misalignments between the prior- and desired-images are
significant, and, the GDSIR method cannot also effectively deal
with the noise-induced artifacts in the case of ultra-low-dose
scan. Meanwhile, the present PWLS-PINL method can relax
the tradeoff of fake structures introduction and noise-induced
streak artifacts reduction based on the nature of nonlocal means
processing in image restoration. In addition, it is worth noting
that the nonlocal mean algorithm as a postprocessing technique
for low-dose CT image restoration can also work well in some
cases. But, when the projection data were seriously corrupted
by excessive X-ray photon noise, the associative FBP image
will suffer from serious noise-induced streak artifacts and then
the nonlocal means algorithm cannot yield any possible satisfactory results due to its ability in preserving structural information.
Meanwhile, the present PWLS-PINL method, by modeling several important physical and statistical factors including detector
geometry, photon statistics, and electronic background noise,
can yield more accurate results than the nonlocal means algorithm from the noisy projection measurements.
For the implementation of the PWLS-PINL method, four
parameters, i.e., search window N , patch-window n, control
parameter h, and hyperparameter β were selected by visual
inspection for eye-appealing result, together with the normaldose image as comparison. In practice, to reduce the computing
burden, the size of the search window should be limited to an
appropriate size. However, the search window should be large
enough to obtain more similar information while minimizing
the influence of the mismatched tissues. Hence, search window
N should be optimally determined by fully considering both
the registration accuracy and the degree of the overall structure changes between the to-be-reconstructed and prior images.
For the selection of the patch-window, extensive experiments
showed that a 5 × 5 patch-window is adequate for effective
noise and artifacts suppression while retaining computational
efficiency. As for the selection of h and β in this study, we
briefly fixed the sizes of the search- and patch-windows and did
not consider the methods that adaptively optimized them, but
we studied the results obtained using a broad range of parameter values by hand in term of visual inspection and quantitative
measurements. This scheme can also be considered as a trial
and error process. Theoretical studies in optimizing the nonlocal relevant parameters have already been conducted using the
SURE approach [43], [44], which provided a useful technique
to determine the parameters in the present algorithm. This is an
interesting topic for future research.
For the modified iterative successive overrelaxation algorithm
in this study, we would like to make the following discussions.
As a version of the widely used one-step-late (OSL) iteration
scheme, the present PWLS-PINL algorithm can be feasibly and
effectively implemented using the present joint optimal reconstruction strategy presented in Section II-C. However, due to the
fact that weight w(k, j) in (6) depends on the unknown image
intensity, the present PINL regularization in (5) is nonconvex for

ZHANG et al.: ITERATIVE RECONSTRUCTION FOR X-RAY COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY

a global optimization. Similar to many existing OSL algorithms
where global convergence is an open issue, the present algorithm also suffered from the lack of strict global convergence
proof. Despite the lack of guarantee of global convergence, the
present algorithm is still effective in practice together using the
joint optimization scheme.
Another major drawback of the present PWLS-PINL algorithm is that the update of the nonlocal weights matrix unavoidably increases the computational burden as described in [28].
To address this issue, one possible strategy is to use infrequent
update of the parameters (nonlocal weights matrix) interleaved
with more frequent OSL steps; and another one is to use fast
computers and dedicated hardware [45] to develop parallel iterative image reconstruction algorithm. We believe that in the
future, most iterative-based image reconstruction algorithms including the present PWLS-PINL may be widely used in medical
clinic.
