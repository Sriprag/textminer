Compressed Sensing Dynamic Cardiac Cine MRI
Using Learned Spatiotemporal Dictionary
Yanhua Wang and Leslie Ying∗ , Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—In dynamic cardiac cine magnetic resonance imaging,
the spatiotemporal resolution is limited by the low imaging speed.
Compressed sensing (CS) theory has been applied to improve the
imaging speed and thus the spatiotemporal resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that employs a patch-based 3-D
spatiotemporal dictionary for sparse representations of dynamic
image sequence in the CS framework. Specifically, the dynamic
image sequence is divided into overlapping patches along both the
spatial and temporal directions. The dictionary is used to provide
flexible sparse expressions for these patches. The underlying optimization problem is solved by variable splitting and the alternating
direction method with multiplier. Experimental results based on in
vivo cardiac data demonstrate that the proposed method is able to
accelerate cardiac cine imaging by a factor up to 8 and outperforms
the existing state-of-the-art CS methods at high accelerations. The
method is expected to be useful in dynamic imaging with a higher
spatiotemporal resolution.

I. INTRODUCTION
YNAMIC cardiac cine magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is a powerful noninvasive and nonionizing technique to monitor the characteristics of cardiac motion [1]. Due
to the physical and physiological constraints, there is a tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolutions in dynamic MRI
(dMRI). To address the tradeoff, a variety of techniques have
been devised, such as fast-scan techniques with advanced pulse
sequences (e.g., EPI [2], [3], Spiral [4], [5]), parallel imaging using phased array coils [6]–[9], and reduced-scan techniques with advanced image reconstruction algorithms (e.g.,
partial Fourier [10], [11], RIGR [12], UNFOLD [13], viewsharing [14], partial separable function [15]–[17], and k−t
BLAST [18]). In reduced-scan techniques, images need to be reconstructed from undersampled k-space data, which leads to an
ill-posed inverse problem. To overcome the ill-posedness, prior

information is usually introduced in terms of certain mathematical models. Recently compressed sensing (CS) has emerged as a
new theory to incorporate prior information in solving ill-posed
problems and has demonstrated great potential for recovering a
signal from its insufficient measurements [19], [20]. The CS theory imposes the sparseness as the prior constraint which asserts
that the signal has only few nonzero elements in some transform
domains. The signal can be thereby accurately recovered from
its reduced measurements by some nonlinear reconstruction algorithms when the measurements satisfy certain conditions. As
an emerging reduced-scan technique, CS has been successfully
applied to accelerate dMRI acquisition [21]–[30]. Such success
is made possible by two properties of dynamic MR images.
First, strong correlations that exhibit between the images in
the dynamic sequence enable sparse representations in specific
transform domains. Second, the sampling scheme in k-t space
can be elaborately designed to satisfy the conditions required
by CS.
The sparsifying transform is essential for the success of CS
reconstruction. The sparser the signal is made with a transform, the better the CS reconstruction is obtained. In the context of dMRI, a sparsifying transform can be applied along the
spatial direction, the temporal direction or both. Typical spatial sparsifying transforms include finite difference and wavelet
transform [31], and temporal transforms include Fourier transform [22], [23], [28]–[30], finite difference [26], [27], and principal component analysis (PCA) [16], [22], [32]. For the spatiotemporal transforms, 3-D transforms such as wavelet-Fourier
transform [21] or 3-D wavelet transform [24] have been exploited. The abovementioned models fall into the category of
predefined transforms. Such transforms have the advantage of
simplicity with known properties, but might not be able to adequately capture all features of the specific image sequence of
interest.
To this end, the studies of adaptive sparse representations
have attracted significant research interests. One of the famous
approaches is dictionary learning (DL) [33]–[35]. A properly
trained overcomplete dictionary is able to provide a sparser
representation over the fixed analytical transforms and has been
used in various applications, such as image/video restoration
[36], [37], machine learning [38], [39], and computer vision
[40], [41]. In the context of CS for MRI, earlier approaches
employed a dictionary to sparsify either the 2-D image patches
[42]–[44] or the 1-D profiles of a sequence of MR images [45].
In this paper, we study a novel patch-based 3-D spatiotemporal dictionary for CS dMRI reconstruction. The dictionary is
learned iteratively from 3-D overlapping patches of the dynamic
image sequence along both the spatial and temporal directions.

Some preliminary results of this paper were partially presented
in [46], [47]. Similar ideas were also presented independently
in [48]–[51]. Our preliminary study has shown encouraging improvements of the 3-D DL approach over the conventional CS
approaches. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive
study of the proposed method for dynamic cardiac image reconstruction using the 3-D DL model. We study the effect of
additional total variation (TV) regularization on the image quality and how to choose the 3-D overlapping patch sizes. We also
develop an efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction
method with multiplier (ADMM) optimization scheme. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method with 3-D DL
and TV regularization achieves superior reconstruction quality
in comparison to the existing CS dMRI schemes.
This paper is structured as follows. Section II presents the
signal model and reviews some related works on CS and DL.
In Section III, we introduce the proposed patch-based 3-D DL
reconstruction framework. The ADMM-based optimization algorithm is also detailed. In Section IV, the performance of the
proposed method is assessed using five cardiac cine datasets.
The robustness to noise and parameter selections is also investigated. Section V discusses the relationship to other existing
works. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section VI.

are usually introduced to overcome the ill-posedness. The CS
theory has provided a promising approach to address the issue of
ill-posedness by imposing the sparsity regularizations [19], [20].
In the noiseless case, CS dMRI problem is formulated as the
following l0 minimization problem:
min Ψx0
x

(4)

where ||x|| 0 counts the number of nonzero elements of the vector
and Ψ represents a certain sparsifying transform. The l0 term
enforces the sparsity in the transform domain and the equality
constraint ensures the consistency with the measured data. The
performance of CS reconstruction is guaranteed when Ψ and
Fu satisfy certain conditions, such as the restricted isometric
property [52], [53] and the mutual coherence property [54], [55].
The l0 minimization problem in (4) is NP hard. A wide variety
of approaches have been developed to mitigate the high computational complexity [56]. One major category is greedy pursuit
algorithms, such as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) [57] and
iterative hard thresholding [58]. Another important approach is
to replace l0 with l1 [19], [20], lp (0 < p < 1) [59], or a hybrid
quasi-norm [60]. Since l1 minimization is convex and has many
efficient solvers, it is widely employed in practical applications.
The corresponding formulation is as follows:

A. Signal Model
In MR dynamic cardiac imaging, the measured signal at time
point t can be modeled as follows:

(1)
y (k,t) = x (r,t) exp (−j2πk · r) dr + n (k,t)

s.t. Fu x = y

s.t.Fu x = y

(5)

where ||x|| 1 = Σ|xi |. The exact recovery of (5) is guaranteed,
but at the cost of increased measurements when compared to
the original problem of (4) [52]. In the presence of Gaussian
measurement noise, (5) is modified to:

r

where r and k are the locations in the spatial and k-space domain, respectively, x(r,t) denotes the desired dynamic image
series, and n(k,t) represents the measured noise. In order to
discretize (1), x(r,t) and y(k,t) are sampled on the grids of N
M
spatial locations {ri }N
i=1 and M k-space locations {ki }i=1 (M ≤
N ). Then, we have the discrete form of (1):
yt = Ft xt + nt

(2)
T

where xt = [x(r1 , t), x(r2 , t),. . ., x(rN ,t)] , yt = [y(k1 , t),
y(k2 , t), . . ., y(kM ,t)]T , Ft is the measurement matrix and nt
= [n(k1 , t), n(k2 , t), . . ., n(kM ,t)]T . More specifically, Ft =
Pt F2−D , where F2−D is an N ×N unitary matrix representing
the 2-D Fourier transform and Pt is an M ×N matrix whose
rows are extracted from an N ×N identity matrix according to
the k-space sampling locations at time t. Suppose a total of Q
cardiac phases are acquired. The entire data acquisition process
can be formulated as follows:
y = Fu x + n

B. Compressed Sensing Dynamic MRI
In accelerated imaging, the k-space data are undersampled
(M < N ) and therefore (3) is underdetermined. Regularizations

where λ is the penalty parameter related to the noise power.
The sparsifying transform Ψ is crucial to the reconstruction process. dMRI data exhibits redundancies in both spatial
and temporal directions. Thus, Ψ can be selected to enforce
the spatial sparsity, temporal sparsity, or spatiotemporal sparsity. The most straightforward scheme simply applies the CS
MRI techniques frame by frame [31] where Ψ is only used
to sparsify the images spatially. On the other hand, the dynamic image sequence can be sparsified in time because it exhibits high correlation along the temporal direction. Typically
used transforms in temporal direction include Fourier transform (e.g., [22], [23], [28]–[30]), finite difference (e.g., [27]),
and PCA (e.g., [16], [22], [32]). The spatial and temporal constraints can be combined together to exploit the spatial and
temporal correlations simultaneously [26]. Moreover, the spatiotemporal sparsifying transforms are also appealing to exploit
such correlations. Typical transforms include wavelet-Fourier
transform [21] and 3-D wavelet transform [24].

WANG AND YING: COMPRESSED SENSING DYNAMIC CARDIAC CINE MRI USING LEARNED SPATIOTEMPORAL DICTIONARY

C. Dictionary Learning in Compressed Sensing Dynamic MRI
Besides the predefined sparsifying transforms which are applicable to specific signals, many researchers have investigated
the dictionary-based sparse representation model [33]–[35]. A
dictionary is a collection of “basic” signals used to sparsely represent a given class of signals. Each “basic” signal is called an
atom. In most cases, the dictionary is overcomplete (or redundant) which means that the number of atoms is larger than the
dimension of a single atom. Representing a signal using a dictionary can take either the synthesis way or the analysis form.
Extensive research studies focus on the synthesis framework
where a given signal is expressed as the linear combination of
a few atoms [33], [34]. In contrast, the analysis approach treats
the dictionary as a linear operator [34], [35]. The sparse coefficients of a given signal are computed via its inner products with
the atoms. The synthesis and analysis models are dramatically
different and we will focus on the synthesis path in the following
discussion.
A data adaptive dictionary is required for specific datasets.
The process of training a dictionary from datasets with the same
features is called DL [33], [34]. Mathematically, given a set
of training signals {sj }Jj=1 , DL aims to solve the following
problem:

min

D ,{αj }

J


sj − Dαj 22

s.t. αj 0 ≤ K ∀j

(8)

j =1

where D stands for the dictionary to be constructed, αj is called
the sparse representation of sj over D, and K represents the
sparsity constraint. As an overcomplete dictionary, D has more
columns than rows. Each atom in D is set to be a unit-norm
vector in order to handle the scaling ambiguity. The above constrained optimization problem can be rewritten in the following
unconstrained form [36], [37]:
min

D ,{αj }

1
2

J

j =1

sj − Dαj 22 + μ

J


αj 0 .

(9)

j =1

The two formulations in (8) and (9) are equivalent when the
penalty parameter μ is properly selected. The DL problem is
nonconvex and NP hard. Typical algorithms adopt the alternating optimization approach which iteratively updates D and
αj [61], [62]. While the α-step can be solved by various sparse
coding algorithms, the core difference lies in the D-step. A
survey of typical DL algorithms can be found in [33] and [34].
Dictionary-based sparse representation or DL has recently
been applied for CS dMRI reconstructions. Since the computational complexity of DL algorithms is usually very high,
practical reconstruction models often enforce the “patch-level”
sparsity. A data patch can be extracted along the spatial direction
or the temporal direction.
When only the spatial correlation is exploited, the dynamic
images are reconstructed frame by frame [42]–[44]. In [42],
the dictionary is trained from prescanned images and the
desired images are reconstructed by solving the following

problem:
min TVS (x) + μ

αj 1 +



Rj x − Dαj 22

(10)

where TVS (x) is the isotropic spatial TV, Rj extracts a
square image patch at a certain time point, F(x, σ) =
Fu x − y22 /2σ 2 + M ×logσ. In contrast, the dictionary is
adaptively learned from the measured data in [43] and the formulation becomes:

Rj x−Dαj 22 +νFu x−y22 s.t.αj 0 ≤ K ∀j.
min
x,D ,{αj }

j

(11)
The alternating optimization method is applied to sequentially
update D, αj , and x. An alternate form of (11) is proposed
in [44]:

s.t.

Fu x − y22 ≤ M σ 2

(12)

and a Bregman iterative algorithm is developed to reduce the
computational load and accelerate the convergence.
The dictionary has also been used to represent the temporal
profiles of a dynamic image sequence. In [45], DL is applied
for CS reconstruction of parameter mapping where the temporal
curves are modeled by the exponential function. The dictionary
is learned from a large collection of prototype signals generated
from the model. The image sequence and its sparse coefficients
are then iteratively updated based on the fixed dictionary.
III. PROPOSED METHOD
A. Problem Formulation
In this paper, we investigate the CS dynamic cardiac MRI
using 3-D DL model for sparse representation. Let Rj be the
operator that extracts a spatiotemporal patch from the dynamic
image sequence x with a predefined size of (nf , np , nt ). The
3-D DL problem is expressed as follows:

1
min
Rj x − Dαj 22 + μ
αj 0 .
(13)
D ,{αj } 2
j
j
We use the unconstrained form to simplify the expressions
in the following derivations. The first term captures the representation errors and the second term implies the sparsity level.
The dictionary D has a size of dr ×dc , where dr =nf ×np ×nt
and dc is the number of atoms. The overcompleteness (or redundancy) η is defined as η = dc /dr . The variation of index j
covers all the available patches. The patch stride is measured by
a vector p = [pf ,pp ,pt ]T which indicates the distance between
the starting voxels in two adjacent patches. In this paper, we
use periodically positioned overlapping patches. We adopt the
maximum overlap (p = [1, 1, 1]T ), and abide by the periodic
boundary conditions. The dimensions of x are extended before
a patch goes beyond the boundaries. The extension parts are
filled by the data from the opposite sides of the image sequence.

Based on the aforementioned 3-D DL model, we formulate
the CS dMRI problem as follows:

where λ1 and λ2 are tuning parameters, and h(x) is an additional
regularizer. The first term enforces the data fidelity in k-space.
The second and the third terms correspond to the 3-D DL model.
The selection of h(x) can be any suitable sparsifying transforms,
such as TV or temporal Fourier transform. In this paper, we
choose the general anisotropic 3-D TV [63]:
h (x) = Gx1 = βx Gx x1 + βy Gy x1 + βt Gt x1
(15)
where Gx , Gy , and Gt are first-order forward finite difference
operators along the frequency encoding (FE), phase encoding
(PE), and temporal directions, respectively, G is the collection
of Gx , Gy , and Gt , i.e., G = [βx GTx , βy GTy , βz GTz ]T , βx , βy ,
and βt are constant scalars.
B. Optimization Algorithm
It is challenging to simultaneously find all unknown variables
in the objective function (14) which is not differentiable due to
the l0 and l1 term. It is also nonconvex because of the l0 term and
the multiplication between D and αj . We note that the nonconvex part (optimization with respect to D and αj ) is independent
of other terms once x is fixed. This part can be solved by any
DL algorithms. When D and αj are known, (14) is simplified to
a standard l1 minimization problem. Recently, variable splitting
and augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) (or the Bregman iteration method) have proven to be efficient approaches to solve
the l1 minimization problems [64]–[66]. In general, these algorithms introduce auxiliary variables to decouple the sparsity
terms with other parts. ALM is then applied to solve the modified constrained problem. In this paper, we focus on a specific
variation of ALM called ADMM [65].
We first introduce an auxiliary variable d = Gx to decouple
the l1 term from other parts and obtain the following equivalent
problem:

Fu x − y22 +

where u is called the scaled dual variable of the Lagrangian

We now delineate the way of solving the subproblems (18)–
(20).
1) {D, α}-Subproblem: The minimization in (18) is the unconstrained form of DL problem. We first convert it to the constrained form [36], [37]:

(22)

As noted in the previous section, the two forms are equivalent for proper values of μ and K. This way, the choice of
μ in (18) (also in (14)) is handled implicitly when we determine K [36], [37]. Choice of K is studied in Section IV. The
constrained DL problem (22) can be efficiently solved by the KSVD algorithm [62]. It adopts a two-stage optimization process
which performs several rounds of alternating updates between
αj and D. The αj stage is a sparse coding problem which is
solved by the OMP algorithm. Then, D is updated column by
column through a rank-one approximation of a residual matrix
by singular value decomposition (SVD). The K-SVD algorithm
needs an initial guess of D. We use the overcomplete discrete
cosine transform (DCT) dictionary for initialization. Although
the K-SVD algorithm cannot guarantee to reach a global minimum, it still shows excellent performances in many applications [36], [37]. Since the amount of overlapping patches in x
is usually very large, we first randomly select a small portion of
all patches for dictionary training. Once D is learned from the
training dataset, we apply OMP to compute αj for all patches.
2) x-Subproblem: This least-squares problem is equivalent
to the following linear equation:

transform. Hence, FH
u y is the zero filling reconstruction of the
measured data. The operator RTj places a patch back to its orig

inal position and j RTj Dαj is the assembly of all estimated


patches. The term j RTj Rj is a diagonal matrix where the
value of each diagonal entry is equal to the number of the patches
that contain the corresponding voxel. Since we apply the maximum overlapping patches and the periodic boundary
conditions,


the diagonal entries are all equal to dr , i.e., j RTj Rj = dr I.
Equation (23) has a closed-form solution by left-multiplying
the inverse of the coefficient matrix on both sides, but the computation of the inverse matrix is impractical due to its large
size. Therefore, we apply the preconditioned conjugated gradient (PCG) algorithm to solve this problem. In order to improve
the convergence, the PCG is initialized with the result from the
previous iteration.
3) d-Subproblem: In this problem, there is no coupling between elements of d. The optimal value is obtained through the
element-wise shrinkage operator [64]:

(25)

Although the aforementioned discussion is focused on 3-D
TV, the algorithm can be easily modified to accommodate other
forms of l1 -norm regurlarizer h(x).
Algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode. The stopping criterion
of the algorithm is either ||xk +1 − xk ||2 /||xk ||2 < ε or a
predefined maximum iteration number is reached.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. Experimental Setup
The performances of the proposed method were evaluated
using five sets of fully sampled 2-D dynamic cardiac cine MRI
data. Prospective cardiac gating was used for all datasets during

acquisition. Some sample frames reconstructed from original
data are presented in Fig. 1 and the corresponding imaging parameters are listed in Table I. In order to simplify the parametertuning process, the five fully sampled datasets were first rescaled
to the image intensity interval of [0, 1]. Then, a portion of the
k-space data was manually extracted to simulate the undersampled scans. We define the net reduction R as the ratio between
the number of the fully sampled data points to that of the undersampled data points. Reconstructions on the same datasets
using the k-t FOCUSS method [22], [28] were performed for
comparison. The same variable-density random sampling pattern was used for both methods. For the datasets acquired using
multiple coils, we reconstructed images for each coil separately
and then combined them using square-root of sum-of-squares.
The k-space sampling pattern is critically important in CS
reconstruction. The incoherence condition of the CS theory
requires that the k-space data should be randomly sampled
to generate incoherent artifacts in the sparse transform domain [31], [54], [55]. The ideal sampling scheme is the 2-D
random pattern, but it is impractical [31]. Thus, we applied the
1-D undersampling pattern along the PE direction frame by
frame [21], [22], [28]–[30]. More specifically, in each frame,
the central part of the k-space was fully sampled with a total
of eight PE lines. Other PE lines were randomly selected according to a given distribution. To achieve the randomness in k-t
domain, the random patterns for different frames were generated
independently with the same distribution. Here, we employed
the Gaussian distribution which was used in the original k-t
FOCUSS papers [22], [28]. Such a variable-density sampling
pattern with more samples at the central k-space is preferred because most k-space energy is concentrated in the low-frequency
part. Comparisons with other distributions such as uniform and
polynomial distributions [29], [31] are studied in Section IV-D.
The optimal selection of the algorithm parameters is also crucial for the reconstruction process, but it is still an open problem. Optimal choices depend on the image structures, dynamic
ranges, and motion characteristics. In this paper, we adopted an
empirical approach. We first tuned the parameters (including the
weight parameters in (14) and the DL parameters in (22)) for
dataset 1 to reach a balance between reconstruction error and
computational time. The same values were then applied for all
other datasets. The detailed procedure and the effect of different
parameters are discussed in the parameter evaluation section.
Throughout all simulations, the nominal values of the regularization parameters are λ1 = 10−2 , λ2 = 10−4 , and ρ = 5×10−3 .
As for the TV weights, we empirically adopt βx = βy = 1
and βt = 10. The maximum iteration number T is 25 and the

1114

TABLE I
DATA ACQUISITION PARAMETERS FOR FIVE DATASETS

stopping criteria ε is 10−6 . If not specifically mentioned, the
default patch size is nf ×np ×nt = 4 × 4 × 4. In DL stage, we
empirically set the dictionary overcompleteness factor η to 4,
i.e., dc = 4 dr , and randomly select 50 dc patches as the training
dataset. In the K-SVD algorithm, we employ ten iterations and
the sparsity constraint K is set to 15. We notice that these values
of parameters work well for all datasets and the results are not
very sensitive to slight changes in these values.
Reconstructions from the rescaled fully sampled data were
used as the references. The performance was quantitatively evaluated in terms of the mean-squared error (MSE), which was
calculated by

(26)
MSE(x̂t ) = x̂t − xt 22 N
where x̂t is the reconstructed image at the tth frame. The MSE of
the whole sequence was simply the average MSE of all frames.
All programs were implemented in MATLAB R2012 a on a
workstation with 3.4-GHz Intel Core i7 central processing unit,
16 GB of memory and Windows 7 Enterprise 64-bit operating
system.
B. Rationale Behind the Proposed Method
As stated in Section II, DL was previously introduced to
CS dMRI to sparsify either the 2-D image patches (2-D DL)
[42]–[44] or the 1-D signal profiles for parameter mapping (1-D
DL) [45]. The two models only capture the spatial or temporal correlation alone in the image sequence. In contrast, the
proposed 3-D DL model is a generalized formulation for dynamic imaging and it is expected to preserve the spatiotemporal
correlation.
The sparse regularizers in the objective function (14) consist
of two parts: one is the 3-D DL and the other is an additional sparsifying transform. Although we select 3-D TV as the additional
term, it can be any other suitable operators. The parameters λ1
and λ2 control their contributions. When λ1 = 0, (14) is boiled
down to the conventional CS model. When λ2 = 0, the objective
function turns out to be the basic 3-D DL model.
In this experiment, we briefly compared the performances of
1-D DL, 2-D DL, and 3-D DL (proposed method without TV),
3-D TV, k-t FOCUSS, and the propose method. We reconstructed the images of dataset 1 using these models. The reduction factor was R = 8 and we fixed the iteration number to
40. Fig. 2(a) displays the region of interest (ROI) images and
errors of the eleventh frame. The result of 1-D DL captures
most of the myocardium contours but fails to suppress the artifacts. The image of 2-D DL is overly smoothed which indicates

that it is unable to reconstruct data with such a high reduction
factor. The 3-D DL model shows great superiority to 1-D DL
and 2-D DL. The result is devoid of aliasing artifacts but loses
some details due to the smoothing effect of the patch average
operation. Both k-t FOCUSS and 3-D TV capture more details
than 3-D DL but they still show some aliasing artifacts. The
proposed method incorporates the advantages of 3-D DL and
3-D TV and thus produces the best reconstructions among all.
Fig. 2(b) and (c) show the frame-by-frame MSEs of different
models. As can be seen, the MSE of 2-D DL is the highest. The
1-D DL model achieves much lower MSE compared with 2-D
DL, which implies the importance of exploiting temporal correlation. The results of 3-D DL, k-t FOCUSS and 3-D TV show
MSE improvement to 1-D DL. The proposed method achieves
the lowest MSE through the combination of 3-D DL and 3-D TV.
C. Reconstruction Performance
In this experiment, we compared the reconstruction quality
of the proposed method to that of k-t FOCUSS. We first reconstructed the image sequence of dataset 1 with R = 8. Fig. 3
shows the ROI images in three different frames (indices: 11, 16,
25) and the corresponding errors. The proposed method captures
most of the structures, though some tiny details are smoothed
due to the average of patches. Compared with k-t FOCUSS,

ROI images and errors in different frames of dataset 1 (R = 8).

the proposed method suppresses the PE direction artifacts and
presents clear contours of the object. The error images with respect to the reference also demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method over k-t FOCUSS. While both methods show
visible errors on the edges of structures, k-t FOCUSS leads to
more aliasing errors. Moreover, the magnitudes of errors in kt FOCUSS are higher than the proposed method. In order to
provide a quantitative comparison on the reconstruction errors,
Fig. 4(a) depicts the MSEs frame by frame. It is evident that
the proposed method has lower MSEs than k-t FOCUSS for all
frames.
We also evaluated the convergence of the proposed algorithm.
The maximum iteration number of 40 was used as the stopping
criterion in this test. We computed the MSE of the entire image
sequence for each iteration. Fig. 4(b) plots the MSE curve versus
the iteration number. The MSE decreases rapidly within the first
few iterations and nearly reaches to a constant in the end. It can
be seen that the MSE change between two successive iterations
is very small after about 10 iterations. It suggests empirically
that the proposed algorithm is able to converge fast.
Comparisons with k-t FOCUSS using other datasets were also
performed for further validation. Fig. 5 shows the ROI images
and errors of a middle frame in datasets 2–dataset 5. The net
reduction factors were R = 6 for dataset 4 and R = 8 for other
datasets. Compared with k-t FOCUSS, the proposed method
shows much fewer artifacts and preserves sharper myocardial
contours. Fig. 6 depicts the frame-by-frame MSEs. It is evident that the proposed method achieves lower MSEs than k-t
FOCUSS for all datasets.

(b) Dataset 3 (R = 8). (c) Dataset 4 (R = 6). (d) Dataset 5 (R = 8).

Fig. 7 compares the temporal profiles at a fixed pixel in the
FE direction of datasets 2 and 3, both with R = 8. It is observed
that the k-t FOCUSS reconstructions are blurry with some loss
of variations and contrasts. The proposed method follows the
original temporal variations closely and captures major motion
features. In general, the proposed method achieves a greater
level of image fidelity compared with k-t FOCUSS.
Table II compares the reconstruction time (only for a single channel) of k-t FOCUSS and the proposed method for all
datasets. The iteration number was fixed to 25 for both methods. For each dataset, we performed ten reconstructions and
computed the average time. For multicoil datasets, the total computational cost is the product of the single-channel cost and the
number of coils. It is shown that the reconstruction time of the
proposed method is about eight to nine times higher than that of
k-t FOCUSS. The major computational burden comes from the
great number of patches in the DL step and the large-scale linear

equation in the image update step. Since we adopt maximum
patch overlap, the number of patches is very large, resulting in
high computational time of {αj }. We notice that the computations of {αj } for different patches are independent. Thus, the
computational time can be reduced by parallel processing techniques. The computational load and the convergence rate of DL
are also expected to be improved by the Bregman-based algorithm [44]. To handle the large scale of the linear equation in the
x step, more auxiliary variables can be added so that the coefficient matrix is separated into several structured matrices with
fast implementations of matrix inversion [67]. Such a strategy
will accelerate the computation significantly, but at the expense
of tuning more parameters.
D. Sampling Patterns
We evaluated the reconstruction MSEs under the sampling
patterns generated from three different distributions: uniform
distribution, polynomial distribution [29], [31], and Gaussian
distribution [22], [28]. Examples of sampling patterns in k-t
domain are shown in Fig. 8(a). We reconstructed dataset 1 with
R = 8 using k-t FOCUSS and the proposed method. For each

distribution, we generated ten realizations of the random pattern,
and the average frame-by-frame MSE curves are depicted in
Fig. 8(b). Both methods are seen to favor Gaussian distribution
which gives the lowest MSEs for most frames. Furthermore, the
proposed method consistently works better than k-t FOCUSS
for all three sampling patterns studied here.
E. Reduction Factors
In this experiment, we investigated the reconstruction performance under different reduction factors R = 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.
The datasets 1 and 2 were used for evaluation. Fig. 9 shows the
ROI images and the errors of the 11th frame in dataset 1 using
k-t FOCUSS and the proposed method. The visual effects of k-t
FOCUSS and the proposed method are very close at low reduction factors such as R = 2 and 4. However, when the k-space
data is undersampled further, the proposed method shows superiority in artifacts suppression. Even at a high reduction factor
of R = 10, the result of proposed method is still free of visible aliasing artifacts and the main structures are well preserved.
The variations of MSE depicted in Fig. 10 also demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method at high reduction factors.
F. Robustness to Noise
Because the above datasets were acquired from real MRI
scanners, they already have noise in the measurements. To

proposed method is robust to noise and has superior denoising
ability to k-t FOCUSS.
G. Parameter Evaluation

evaluate the robustness of the proposed method to noise, we
manually added additional complex Gaussian white noises in
the k-space data of datasets 1 and 2 with different signal-tonoise ratios (SNR), where the SNR was measured as the ratio
of energy between the signal (original data) and the (added)
noise. The same set of values was used for the parameters in the
proposed method. The results of k-t FOCUSS are also presented
for comparison. We selected proper parameters for k-t FOCUSS
to get the lowest MSE.
Fig. 11 shows the ROI images and errors of the 11th frame
for dataset 1 and the 12th frame for dataset 2 with a reduction
factor R = 8. The image qualities of both methods degrade as
the SNR decreases. However, the proposed method still obtains
acceptable results with less noise and clearer contours than k-t
FOCUSS even at a low SNR (15 dB). The quality degradation of
proposed method is also not as obvious as that of k-t FOCUSS.
Fig. 12 depicts the frame-by-frame MSEs at SNR = 30 dB and
SNR = 15 dB. It is seen that the proposed method outperforms
k-t FOCUSS at all SNRs. This experiment has shown that the

We evaluated the sensitivity of the proposed method to major parameters including the 3-D DL weighing (λ1 ), 3-D TV
weighting (λ2 ), patch size (nf ×np ×nt ), the dictionary overcompleteness (η), the sparsity constraint (K), and the temporal
difference weighting (βt ). We used dataset 1 with R = 8 as
an example for this evaluation. In each experiment, we only
changed the values of one parameter and kept other parameters
fixed at their default values unless further noted.
We first evaluated the effects of the weighting parameters λ1
and λ2 . We set the penalty parameter ρ to 50λ2 . Fig. 13(a) shows
the MSE versus λ2 curves under λ1 = 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001. The
curve of λ1 = 0.1 shows much higher MSE than that of smaller
λ1 values. The MSE trend suggests that the best λ1 is 0.01 ≤ λ1
≤ 0.001. Within the range, the U-shaped MSE curve indicates
10−5 ≤ λ2 ≤ 10−4 to be optimal. The problem is overly or
under regularized for λ1 and λ2 outside the ranges. The rather
flat curve also shows the proposed algorithm is not sensitive to
the regularization parameters to some extent.
Fig. 13(b) plots the MSEs versus various patch size. Note that
the horizontal axis ticks are labeled on the format of “spatial size
× temporal size.” The patch sizes from 32 × 3 to 82 × 8 indicate
that nf × np × nt varies from 3 × 3 × 3 to 8 × 8 × 8. The patch
size 42 × 1 means that the dictionary is 2-D and the patch size
12 × 25 implies a 1-D dictionary. For 3-D dictionaries, the MSE
is improved with an increase in patch size from 3 to 5, which
suggests that small patches cannot express the special features
well. When the block size increases from 5 to 8, the reconstruction quality degrades. The reason is probably that larger patches
would require dictionaries with more redundancy and our fixed
redundancy fails to represent the large patches accurately. It is
also seen that the 1-D and 2-D dictionary models lead to higher
MSE than 3-D model. The MSE difference between patch sizes
4 and 5 is very small, but the computational time for the latter
size is much higher. Therefore, we chose 4 × 4 × 4 as the default
patch size.
The redundancy of a dictionary provides more freedom for
sparse representation. The increase of the number of atoms generally improves the capability of capturing spatiotemporal details and thus leads to better spatial and temporal resolutions. As

1118

βy ). However, when βt becomes too large, the temporal profiles
are overly smoothed.
These results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is not
overly sensitive to variations of these selected parameters. Although the values of each parameter are set the same in different
datasets, we are aware that optimizing parameters for each individual dataset may accelerate the convergence and achieve better
performance. However, how to optimize these parameters is still
an open problem which is beyond the scope of this paper. It is
also worthwhile to note that the newly developed nonparametric
Bayesian approach can help mitigate the requirement of prior
information in DL [68], but the high computational complexity
prevents this approach from being employed in our method at
this time.
V. DISCUSSION

shown in Fig. 13(c), the performance is improved as the redundancy factor increases from 2 to 6. Theoretically, the number of
atoms is bounded by the available amount of training patches.
However, it is seen that the MSE change from 4 to 6 is rather
small, which implies limited improvements for larger overcompletenesses. Considering the computational burden, we chose 4
as the default value.
Fig. 13(d) presents the MSE versus the sparsity constraint.
The MSE decreases rapidly as the sparsity threshold is increased
from 5 to 13. The reason is that some useful information will
be lost if the threshold is too low. When the sparsity level keeps
increasing, the MSE becomes more stable and we select 15 as
the default value.
The 3-D TV in (15) is able to control the weightings in different directions. We fixed βx = βy = 1, changed βt from 1 to
50, and plotted the MSE curve in Fig. 13(e). The performance
is initially improved as βt increases. The MSE reaches the minimum at βt = 10 which is adopted as the default value. This is
because in cardiac cine imaging, only the cardiac region shows
notable motions, while temporal variations of other regions are
small. The temporal difference images between adjacent frames
are sparser (concentrated in the cardiac region) than the spatial
difference images, and thus should be weighted more (βt > βx ,

Employing a dictionary to sparsify the 3-D volumes in the
image sequence has been presented in [48]. Our approach is
different in two aspects. First and foremost, the 3-D volume
in [48] comprises a set of image patches from all time frames and
the atoms are further enforced to be of low rank. DL with such a
large volume size leads to very high computational complexity.
In addition, the temporal variations over such a long period
of time might be difficult to learn. The proposed 3-D patch
representation in this paper should address the issues where
a portion of the total frames are extracted to construct the 3-D
overlapping patches for DL. Second, although both the proposed
model (14) and the formulation in [48] combine 3-D DL with
an additional sparsity constraint, our algorithm is derived in a
distinct manner. The proposed approach is based on variable
splitting and ADMM. Even though the problem is nonconvex,
the algorithm still achieves promising results and shows fast
convergence rate.
Various experiments have shown the superiority of the proposed method to k-t FOCUSS in terms of reconstruction quality.
The improvements are enabled by the framework of dictionarybased sparse representation. k-t FOCUSS exploits only the
temporal correlations but not the spatial structures, resulting
in aliasing artifacts along the spatial direction. Furthermore, the
predetermined sparsifying transform in k-t FOCUSS, namely
the temporal Fourier transform, cannot make the cardiac images
to be sparse enough so that reconstructions from highly undersampled data show artifacts. In contrast, the proposed model
exploits both the spatial and temporal correlations adaptively
through the learned dictionary, and thereby the cardiac images
can be made sufficiently sparse to be reconstructed from highly
reduced data.
Although the proposed method was developed for the singlecoil case, we are aware of some parallel dynamic imaging methods, such as paralleled k-t FOCUSS [22] and k-t SPARSESENSE [29]. Parallel imaging can be incorporated into the
proposed method by changing the Fourier encoding matrix
to sensitivity encoding matrix. Because acquiring accurate
coil sensitivities for each time frame can be challenging, we
will investigate incorporating parallel imaging in our future
study.

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a new CS reconstruction method
for dynamic cardiac cine MRI based on a 3-D DL model. The
model adopts an adaptively trained spatiotemporal dictionary for
sparse representations. The image sequence is divided into 3-D
overlapping patches which are enforced to be sparsely expressed
over the learned dictionary. We also developed an efficient algorithm based on variable splitting and ADMM. The proposed
method is validated using five cardiac cine data. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms k-t FOCUSS in terms of artifact removal and image fidelity, especially
in high-reduction factor cases. Numerous experiments under
different parameter settings show that the proposed method is
robust to noise and is not sensitive to parameter changes.
