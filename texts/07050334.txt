Abstract—Most prosthetic myoelectric control studies have
shown good performance for unimpaired subjects. However, performance is generally unacceptable for amputees. The primary
problem is the poor quality of electromyography (EMG) signals of
amputees compared with healthy individuals. To improve clinical
performance of myoelectric control, this study explored transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate brain activity
and enhance EMG quality. We tested six unilateral transradial
amputees by applying active and sham anodal tDCS separately on
two different days. Surface EMG signals were acquired from the
affected and intact sides for 11 hand and wrist motions in the pretDCS and post-tDCS sessions. Autoregression coefficients and linear discriminant analysis classifiers were used to process the EMG
data for pattern recognition of the 11 motions. For the affected side,
active anodal tDCS significantly reduced the average classification
error rate (CER) by 10.1%, while sham tDCS had no such effect.
For the intact side, the average CER did not change on the day
of sham tDCS but increased on the day of active tDCS. These results demonstrated that tDCS could modulate brain function and
improve EMG-based classification performance for amputees. It
has great potential in dramatically reducing the length of learning
process of amputees for effectively using myoelectrically controlled
multifunctional prostheses.

I. INTRODUCTION
URFACE electromyography (EMG) signals have long been
used as control input for myoelectric prostheses [1]–[4],
and pattern recognition methods have been employed to classify
EMG signals toward multifunctional prosthesis control for more
than 20 years [5]–[7]. Though the classification accuracy of
intact-limb subjects can be as high as 95% [8]–[10], clinical use
and commercial impact of multifunctional prostheses are still
limited [11]. In general, amputees cannot produce consistent and
distinguishable muscle activity patterns as intact-limb subjects,

which are essential for robust pattern recognition-based control
of prostheses [12]. Consequently, the number of motions that can
be reliably classified is limited for amputees, and they require a
long and frustrating learning phase before they can effectively
use the devices. This is a primary reason for the low retention
rate of multifunctional prostheses [13], [14].
Several studies demonstrated that repetitive exercise and
training could both improve the motor function of transradial
amputees and decrease classification error rate (CER) for EMG
pattern recognition. Kato et al. increased the number of classes
that could be identified from 3 to 6 (CER was less than 20%)
[15]. Powell et al. demonstrated that three weeks of exercise
could reduce CER from 22.5% to 5.6% with as many as eight
motion classes [12]. However, repetitive exercise and long-term
training often frustrate the user, leading to frequent device abandonment. Thus, alternative novel methods, which can facilitate
user learning and reduce length and complexity of the training
phase, are imperative for better user compliance of myoelectrically controlled prostheses.
Recently, noninvasive brain stimulation has become one of the
most promising techniques for neuromodulation. These techniques include transcranial magnetic stimulation [16], transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation [17], and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) [18], [19]. These three methods can be
used to modulate different cortical areas, changing the associated neurophysiological signals. Transcranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS), a type of tES, is widely used by researchers
due to its low cost, versatility, and portability [20]–[22]. In tDCS,
a small constant direct current is delivered to the brain through
large pad electrodes placed on the scalp [23]. Some research
works suggested that direct current flow changed excitability of
neurons in the brain by altering resting membrane potential [24],
[25], i.e., priming the corresponding cortex area. Nitsche et al.
demonstrated that anodal stimulation increased motor cortex
excitability (facilitation) while cathodal stimulation decreased
excitability (inhibition) [26].
Hummel et al. and Fregni et al. showed that anodal tDCS of
stroke patients’ lesioned primary motor cortex improved distal
motor function measured by the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function
Test (JTT) [27]–[29]. A pilot study by Boggio et al. provided
evidence of a positive effect of anodal tDCS on the enhancement of nondominant hand motor function in healthy subjects
[30]. These subjects used their hands asymmetrically in daily
life. As a result, there was a lateral imbalance of motor cortical
excitability between the dominant and nondominant hands. A
similar situation exists for unilateral transradial amputees: the
affected side is not used at all, thereby decreasing the excitability of corresponding motor cortex with respect to the intact side.

This results in a lateral imbalance of the motor cortical excitability of amputees that is more pronounced than that of the
healthy subjects’ hand dominance. Reilly et al. demonstrated
that different movement intentions of the phantom limb could
activate different phantom movement cortical representations,
which would produce distinct EMG patterns in stump muscles
[31]. They further showed a positive correlation between a reduction of voluntary accessibility to phantom limb movement
representations and time from amputation, thereby resulting in
a “frozen” phantom limb in some extreme cases. We hypothesize that the modulation of the amputee’s motor cortex, through
noninvasive cortical stimulation, such as tDCS, will facilitate
“awakening” the “frozen” phantom limb movement representations, accelerate the relearning process of motor tasks, and
consequently improve the quality of the EMG signals, i.e., the
consistency of the same motion and the distinctiveness of different motions. As a result, the user training phase for a myoelectrically controlled prosthesis can be significantly shortened
and its complexity is reduced. Dutta et al. recently presented a
study on facilitating myoelectric control in healthy subjects with
tDCS for triggering functional electrical stimulation [32], which
improved on–off detection performance from a single muscle.
This is, however, different from myoelectric control for multifunctional prostheses, which requires coordinating activations
of multiple muscles. Krishnan et al. demonstrated that elbow
flexor muscle recruitment strategies could be altered by anodal
tDCS [33]. They suggested that tDCS could be used as a potentially adjuvant therapy for the treatment of muscle weakness
and activation failure.
In this study, we investigate whether anodal tDCS of the contralateral primary motor cortex can improve the myoelectric
control performance for 11 classes of phantom hand and wrist
motions. The proposed experiments are conducted on six unilateral transradial amputees to test the effects of anodal tDCS.
Autoregression (AR) coefficients and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers are used to process EMG data. A preliminary version of this work on three able-bodied subjects and one
transradial amputee has been previously reported [34].
II. METHODS
A. Subjects
Six unilateral transradial amputees (three males and three females; aged 36–72; referenced as Sub1–Sub6) participated in
this experiment (see Table I). None of the subjects had prior

tDCS experience. The subjects had neither neurological disorders, nor any contraindication to tDCS. The subjects were not
informed about the positive effects of tDCS in order to avoid
the placebo effect. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. All subjects signed
informed consent and testing procedures were in compliance
with the Declaration of Helsinki.
B. Experiment Setup
The subjects underwent two interventions: active and sham
anodal tDCS of the primary motor cortex corresponding to the
affected side. They participated in experiments on three days,
with one specific task on each day. On the first day, there was
no tDCS intervention session. The subjects were introduced to
the myoelectric experiment environment and familiarized themselves with the experimental protocol. For the myoelectric control training procedure, the subjects were instructed to perform
motions using either the affected side or the intact side the
same way as in the pre-tDCS sessions and the post-tDCS sessions of the following two days. After training and exercising,
the myoelectric performance of the subjects became stable. On
the second and third days, the subjects were randomized to
receive either active anodal tDCS intervention or sham tDCS
intervention. There was an interval of 48 h between the latter
two experiment days, each of which included three sessions:
pre-tDCS myoelectric control session, tDCS session (sham or
active), and post-tDCS myoelectric control session (see Fig. 1).
In the pre-tDCS sessions and the post-tDCS sessions, the
subjects were instructed to perform motions using either the affected side or the intact side. The number of the affected side of
the subjects was equally distributed on the left and the right (see
Table I). Thus, performing motions in sequence of the left and
the right sides ensured that both the affected and the intact sides
would be randomly allocated. The “mirrored bilateral motion”
strategy was not used, because the representation of contralateral limb motion would invade the primary motor cortex corresponding to the affected side [35]–[37], which could result in
unexpected artifacts on the performance of tDCS. Independent
side motions were necessary to exclude this effect on the primary motor cortex corresponding to the affected side. Thus, the
subjects did not obtain help when performing “mirrored bilateral motion.” Eleven classes of hand and wrist motions were
performed in the following order: hand close (HC), hand open
(HO), key grip (KG), tip prehension (TP), wrist flexion (WF),
wrist extension (WE), radial deviation (RD), ulnar deviation

session was 20 min.

(UD), forearm supination (FS), forearm pronation (FP), and
“no movement” (NM). In each trial, the subjects were asked to
perform each motion for 10 s. Ten trials were performed for each
side in both of the two sessions. To avoid fatigue, the subjects
rested between each trial.
In the tDCS sessions, the subjects underwent 1-mA active
or sham anodal tDCS for 20 min by using a DC-Stimulator
(NeuroConn Inc., Germany). A 5 cm × 7 cm saline-soaked
sponge anodal electrode was placed over C3 or C4 (international
10/20 electroencephalogram (EEG) system) and the cathodal
electrode was placed over the contralateral supraorbital area [see
Fig. 2(a)]. It should be noted that C3 or C4 was chosen depending
on the affected side. For the sham stimulation, the electrodes
were placed on the same positions; however, the current was
ramped up over 10 s, held constant at 1 mA for only 10 s (not
the full 20 min), and then ramped down to zero over 10 s to
provide blinding effects.
C. Data Acquisition
EMG signals were acquired by a Trigno wireless system
(Delsys Inc., Boston, MA, USA). Four-channel EMG signals
were recorded from four forearm muscles of each side [see
Fig. 2(b)]: 1) flexor carpi ulnaris; 2) flexor carpi radialis; 3)
extensor carpi radialis; and 4) extensor carpi ulnaris. The skin
surface of the areas of interest was rubbed lightly with alcohol to reduce impedance. All electrodes were mounted over
the targeted muscles using medical adhesive tapes. The electrodes were wirelessly connected to the Trigno Base Station,
which communicated with a computer through a USB cable.
The EMG signals were sampled at 2000 Hz and bandpass filtered (passband 20–450 Hz).

Sub2 from the top view and (b) positions of the EMG electrodes on the affected
and intact sides of Sub2. The amputee’s left hand was lost.

D. Data Processing
Feature extraction is a necessary step for pattern recognitionbased myoelectric control. As the AR features have been shown
to be efficient and effective in previous myoelectric control
studies [1], [38], [39], sixth-order AR coefficients were used
in this study. Here, the length of analysis window was set to
200 ms and the increment of two adjacent windows was set
to 50 ms. The feature set was computed on each of the four
channels of one side, and then concatenated to form a 24-D
feature vector.
The LDA classifier has been widely used for pattern recognition of EMG signals [7], [8]. It is widely accepted that the LDA
classifier can perform comparably with more sophisticated classifiers [40] and generalizes better than nonlinear classifiers in
the presence of electrode shift [41]. Hence, the LDA classifier
was used in this study. A twofold cross-validation procedure
was used. One-half of the data were randomly selected and used
as a training set to train the LDA classifier, while the remaining
half were used as a testing set.
E. Quantification of Feature Space
The mean semiprincipal axis (MSA) and the separability index (SI), proposed by [42], were applied to quantify variations
in EMG signals in the feature space between the pre-tDCS and
post-tDCS sessions.
MSA is defined to measure the size of the hyperellipsoid, as
a mean value of the geometric mean of the semiprincipal axes

intraclass dispersion.
SI is defined to measure the diversity of different motion
classes, as a mean value of one-half of the Mahalanobis distance
from the centroid of the ellipsoid of class j to the centroid of

the ellipsoid of the nearest class i across N motion classes:

sessions on both the day of active tDCS and the day of sham

sessions. If ST is larger than 1, it indicates that EMG signals
of the post-tDCS sessions are more consistent than that of the
pre-tDCS sessions.
G. Statistical Analysis
A four-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze
CER. The ANOVA included the following four factors: side
(affected/intact), stimulation (tDCS/sham), time (pre/post), and
motion (11 classes). Prior to the statistical analysis, Fisher’s
transformation was applied on the values of CER/100 to normalize the data. Further, a three-way repeated measures ANOVA
was used to analyze MSA and SI. The three factors were: side
(affected/intact), stimulation (tDCS/sham), and time (pre/post).
Similarly, a three-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to
analyze ST. The three factors were: side (affected/intact), stimulation (tDCS/sham), and motion (ten classes of active motions).
In all ANOVA tests, the full model was conducted first. When
a significant interaction was detected, a simple-effect analysis
was conducted by fixing the levels of one of the interacting
factors. When no interaction was detected, a reduced ANOVA
model with only main factors was performed. Only a significant difference was reported for these statistical analyses. The
significance level for all tests was p = 0.05.

III. RESULTS
The CER results were achieved through AR feature extraction
and LDA classification on EMG signals. The feature space was
quantified by MSA and SI indexes, and the stability of EMG
signals was quantified by ST index. The statistical method based
on ANOVA was used to analyze the results.
A. CER of Affected and Intact Sides
Fig. 3 shows the CER of the affected side of the subjects in
different sessions. As shown in Fig. 3, the average CER of the
affected side across the subjects was significantly reduced after
active anodal tDCS by 10.1 ± 2.6% on the day of active tDCS
(p < 0.001). Consistent reduction was found for every subject.
The greatest improvement was found for Sub3 (13.5%), and the
smallest improvement was found for Sub2 (7.1%). On the day of
sham tDCS, however, no significant change was found between
the average CER of the pre-tDCS and post-tDCS sessions. The
average change from the pre-tDCS session to the post-tDCS
session was 0.7% (increased after the sham tDCS session).
Fig. 4 shows the CER of the intact side of the subjects in
different sessions. As shown in Fig. 4, the average CER of the
intact side changed from 6.2% to 6.9% on the day of sham tDCS,
and changed from 5.6% to 8.8% on the day of active tDCS.
To further investigate the individual contribution of each motion on the average CER reduction, Table II shows the CER of
each motion of the affected side of the subjects on the day of
active tDCS. Greater improvements are highlighted with bold
text (the improvements larger than 13%). The average CER reduction of the hand motions and the wrist motions was 15.6%
and 7.9%, respectively.
The four-way ANOVA on CER found a statistically significant interaction among side, stimulation, and time (p < 0.001).
Since motion did not interact with other three factors, and we
were not particularly interested in the effects on CER of different motions, we averaged the CER across different motions,
leaving only three factors (side, stimulation, and time). In the
subsequent three-way ANOVA, we found the interaction of the
three factors significant (p = 0.004), which prompted us to use a
simple-effects analysis to break down the ANOVA further

1932

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015

into subsequent two-way ANOVA, looking separately at the
affected side and the intact side for main effects and interaction
between stimulation and time.
For the affected side, the two-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant interaction between stimulation and time
(p < 0.001), which prompted us to use a simple-effect analysis
to break down the ANOVA further into subsequent one-way
ANOVA, looking separately at the active tDCS and the sham
tDCS for main effect of time. For the active tDCS, the one-way
ANOVA found that the CER of the post-tDCS session (17.2 ±
3.0%) was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than that of the pretDCS session (27.3 ± 3.5%). For the sham tDCS, the one-way
ANOVA revealed no statistically significant main effect of Time
(p = 0.45). The CER of the pre-tDCS and post-tDCS sessions
was 24.3 ± 3.9% and 25.0 ± 3.9%, respectively.
For the intact side, the two-way ANOVA revealed a small
but statistically significant interaction between the two factors
(p = 0.048), which prompted us to use a simple-effect analysis
to break down the ANOVA further into subsequent one-way
ANOVA, looking separately at the active tDCS and the sham
tDCS for main effect of Time. For the active tDCS, the one-way
ANOVA found that the CER of the post-tDCS session (8.8 ±
1.4%) was significantly higher (p = 0.004) than that of the pretDCS session (5.6 ± 1.2%). For the sham tDCS, the one-way
ANOVA revealed no statistically significant main effect of time
(p = 0.396). The CER of the pre-tDCS and post-tDCS sessions
was 6.2 ± 1.4% and 6.9±1.6%, respectively.
B. Variations in EMG Feature Space Between Pre-tDCS and
Post-tDCS Sessions
To understand the sources of the improvement in the aforementioned classification, the MSA and SI of the affected and
intact sides for each subject in the pre-tDCS and post-tDCS sessions on the day of the active and sham tDCS were calculated.
Fig. 5 shows the MSA and SI of the affected side for each subject in the pre-tDCS and post-tDCS sessions on the day of the
active and sham tDCS. Except for Sub2, active tDCS decreased
the MSA for all subjects [see Fig. 5(a)]. The smallest MSA was
0.057 in the post-tDCS session on the day of active tDCS for
Sub1. Further, active tDCS increased the SI for all subjects [see
Fig. 5(b)]. The biggest SI was 2.40 in the post-tDCS session
on the day of active tDCS for Sub1. Comparing the average
MSA of the affected side in the pre-tDCS session with that in
the post-tDCS session on the day of active tDCS [see Fig. 5(a)],
active tDCS decreased the MSA of the feature vector, however
no statistical difference was found, possibly due to the small
sample size. Comparing the average SI of the feature vector
of the affected side in the pre-tDCS session with that in the
post-tDCS session on the day of active tDCS [see Fig. 5(b)],
active tDCS increased the SI of the feature vector, however no
statistical difference was found, possibly due to the small sample
size.
For MSA, the three-way ANOVA revealed a main effect of
Side (p < 0.001). No other statistically significant three-way,
two-way interactions, or main effects were revealed. For SI, the
three-way ANOVA revealed a main effect of side (p < 0.001).

sessions of the affected side on the day of the active and sham tDCS. (a) MSA
of the feature vector and (b) SI of the feature vector. Error bars represent the
standard error. The rightmost four bars are the average values across all subjects.

No other statistically significant three-way, two-way interactions, or main effects were revealed. The ANOVA for MSA and
SI revealed no statistically significant three-way, two-way interactions, nor main effects with the exception of the main effect of
side. The results of the above ANOVA suggested that the EMG
signals of the affected side and the intact side were significantly
different in the feature space.
C. Stability Analysis of EMG Signals
The ST of the active motions of the affected and intact sides
for each subject on the day of the active and sham tDCS were
calculated. Table III shows the ST of each motion of the affected side of the subjects on the day of active tDCS. Most ST
values were greater than 1, which indicated smaller variance in
the magnitudes of activation pattern vectors in the post-tDCS
session. The STs highlighted with bold text were the motions
corresponding to the greater improvements in Table II. Except
for HO and UD of Sub1, HC of Sub3, FP of Sub5 and HC of
Sub6, the STs highlighted with bold text were over 1 (the STs
of HO and WE for Sub5 even reached 3.43 and 6.19), which

indicated the greater improvements of these motions were induced by the more stable EMG signals after the active anodal
tDCS intervention. Since the average ST of each motion across
the subjects was greater than 1, generally, the amplitudes of the
EMG signals of the post-tDCS session were more stable than
that of the pre-tDCS session. Thus, it appeared that the stability of the EMG signals increased after the active anodal tDCS
intervention.
The three-way ANOVA on ST revealed a statistically significant two-way interaction between Side and Stimulation
(p = 0.004). A statistically significant main effect of Side was
also revealed (p = 0.002). No other statistically significant
three-way, two-way interactions, or main effects were revealed.
Subsequently, we used a simple-effects analysis to break down
the ANOVA further into subsequent two-way ANOVA, looking
separately at the affected side and the intact side for main effects and interaction between Stimulation and Motion. For the
affected side, the two-way ANOVA revealed no two-way interaction (p = 0.877). But, a main effect of stimulation was found
to be statistically significant (p = 0.010). The two-way ANOVA
showed that the STs of the active motions of the affected side
on the day of active tDCS were significantly higher than that
on the day of sham tDCS (p = 0.010). For the intact side, the
two-way ANOVA revealed no statistically significant two-way
interaction or main effects. The results of the above ANOVA
suggested that the increase in ST was due to the stimulation
mode, not due to the training effects. Unlike the affected side,
the significant deterioration of the classification performance of
the intact side was not reflected on the ST. The main reason was
likely that the increase in CER of the intact side on the day of
active tDCS was only 3.2%, which was much smaller compared
to the reduction (10.1%) of the affected side on the day of active
tDCS.
IV. DISCUSSION
This study investigated whether anodal tDCS of the contralateral primary motor cortex of the affected side could improve the
classification performance of the EMG signals acquired from
residual muscles in the stump of amputees. The results showed
that there was a significant decrease in CER of the 11 phantom
motions on the day of active tDCS (p < 0.001), but not on the
day of sham tDCS (p = 0.45). After active tDCS, the average
CER of the affected side significantly decreased from 27.3% to
17.2% (p < 0.001).

A. Improvement of Classification Performance of Affected Side
After the first day, enough repetitions and exercise of all
the motions stabilized the performance of the affected side as
demonstrated by no significant difference between the pre-tDCS
and post-tDCS sessions on the day of sham tDCS (p = 0.45).
Therefore, the significant decrease in CER of the affected side on
the day of active tDCS should be due to the active anodal tDCS
intervention. Because active anodal tDCS could increase the motor cortex excitability [26], it was reasonable to suggest that such
a positive change in the cortical activity resulted in more consistent muscle contractions when the subject performed the same
motor task, and more distinctive muscle contractions when the
subject performed different motor tasks. As a result, the classification performance was significantly improved on the affected
side. This intervention rapidly improved the performance of myoelectric control (within 20 min), not by advanced algorithms,
but by improving the signal conditioning at the source, i.e., the
subject’s ability to produce more consistent (same motion) and
more distinctive (different motions) EMG signals, as a result of
noninvasive cortical stimulation.
As shown in Table II, the performance improvements of Sub1,
Sub3, Sub5, and Sub6 were mainly from the four hand motions
(HC, HO, KG, and TP). For Sub2, the improvement was mainly
from UD and FS motions. For Sub4, the improvement was
mainly from HO and RD motions. From the average CER of
each motion across the subjects, we found that the performance
improvements for the hand motions were more pronounced than
the wrist motions.
B. Deterioration of Classification Performance of Intact Side
On the intact side, we found no significant difference in CER
between the pre-tDCS and post-tDCS sessions during the day of
sham tDCS (p = 0.396). Surprisingly, here we found a negative
effect on the day of active tDCS, i.e., the average CER of the intact side increased after the anodal tDCS intervention on the day
of active tDCS (p = 0.004) (see Fig. 4). This interesting phenomenon could not be attributed to physical or mental fatigue of
the subjects, because the experimental sequence was random.
Initially, we thought that tDCS would have no effect on the
intact side, because all the subjects only received active anodal
tDCS on the motor cortex area related to the affected side, and
the cathode was placed on the forehead instead of the motor
cortex area related to the intact side. Previous research only
showed that cathodal tDCS could suppress the activity of the

1934

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015

cortex [26]. This phenomenon of negative effect on the intact
side could be explained by interhemispheric inhibition (IHI),
which meant that the activity of the primary motor cortex of one
hemisphere inhibited the activity of the other hemisphere [43].
Pal et al. showed that the decrease of excitability in the dominant
motor cortex induced a decrease in IHI from the dominant onto
the nondominant motor cortex; consequently, excitability of the
nondominant motor cortex increased [44]. Vines et al. demonstrated that dual-hemisphere tDCS, which placed the cathodal
electrode over the dominant motor cortex, improved motor function of the nondominant hand more than unihemisphere tDCS
[45]. They also mentioned that the inhibition effect of cathodal
tDCS on the dominant side caused higher excitability of the
nondominant side compared with unihemisphere tDCS. Here,
we suggested that the increase of excitability in motor cortex
of the affected side induced by anodal tDCS enhanced the IHI
from the motor cortex of the affected side onto that of the intact
side; therefore, the CER of the intact side increased. However,
this mechanism was very complex, and we left this issue as an
open question for future work.
C. Diversity of Subject Population
Table I shows the differences between subject’s amputation
and prosthesis usage. Sub3 and Sub4 had their amputations over
30 years and never used myoelectric prostheses. Their CERs of
the affected side were much higher than the others, even after the
active tDCS intervention (see Fig. 3). Taking the experience into
account, as Sub1, Sub2, and Sub6 had some experience with
myoelectric prostheses, their CERs of the affected side were
relatively lower than that of Sub3 and Sub4. A previous study
also showed that the CERs of the experienced intact-limb subjects were significantly lower than that of the novice intact-limb
subjects [42]. Sub5 had never used myoelectric prostheses before, the same as Sub3 and Sub4, but Sub5 had the shortest
time from amputation. So the CER of the affected side of Sub5
was much lower than that of Sub3 and Sub4 in the pre-tDCS
session and achieved less than 10% in the post-tDCS session
on the day of active tDCS. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the average
performance improvement was 8.7% across the three experienced subjects (Sub1, Sub2, and Sub6) and was 11.3% across
the three novice subjects (Sub3, Sub4, and Sub5). The average
performance improvement across the three experienced subjects
was lower than that across the three novice subjects. Since the
experienced subjects used the residual muscles’ EMG to control
a conventional prosthesis in daily life, the cortex excitability of
the affected side of them might be higher than that of the novice
subjects. Due to the ceiling effect, the effect of anodal tDCS
increasing motor cortical excitability for experienced subjects
was relatively smaller than that for novice subjects.
From Table I, we knew that three subjects (Sub1, Sub3, and
Sub6) were dominant (right) hand amputated and three subjects
(Sub2, Sub4, and Sub5) were nondominant (left) hand amputated. Boggio et al. demonstrated that, for intact-limb subjects,
anodal tDCS enhanced nondominant hand motor function but
could not enhance dominant hand motor function [30]. The

results in the present study showed that anodal tDCS significantly improved the classification performance of the affected
side for each subject, regardless of the affected side was dominant or nondominant. There was, apparently, no difference between the dominant and nondominant sides. A previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in upper limb
amputees demonstrated that the intact hand movements of amputees resulted in a similar activation level to the dominant hand
movements in intact-limb controls [35]. We believed that the affected side was used much less than the intact side following
amputation, which caused the motor cortical excitability of the
affected side to be much lower than that of the intact side. Due to
the brain plasticity, the change of cerebral activity might change
the innate dominant hand of the unilateral transradial amputees
from the dominant side into the intact side. Our results suggested that the motor cortex excitability of the affected side of
the amputees was enhanced by anodal tDCS.
D. Changes in EMG Signals
As shown in Table III, active anodal tDCS increased the stability of EMG signals. The results showed that active tDCS
induced improvement of the affected side contributed to the increased stability of EMG signals. Since the STs of most motions
with greater CER reductions were larger than 1, we attributed
the increased stability to the improved ability of the subjects
in mastering how to perform these motions after the active anodal tDCS intervention. If the subjects mastered how to perform
the motions clearly, as if they had an exact target to reach, the
EMG signals of these motions generated by the subjects should
be more stable. For motions with greater CER reductions and
smaller STs (less than 1), we believed that their CER reductions
were mainly induced by the increased interclass distances, even
if the EMG signals were not more stable than before.
E. Role of tDCS
The subjects performed 11-class hand and wrist motions immediately before and after tDCS. The total time consumed in either the pre-tDCS or the post-tDCS sessions was approximately
60 min. Therefore, it was adequate to evaluate the after-effects
of tDCS, as a previous study showed that the after-effects of
13-min 1-mA tDCS on motor cortex excitability could last 60–
90 min [46].
We compared the results obtained in this study to those of
similar studies on motor function of the nondominant hand in
healthy subjects [30] or motor function of the paretic hand in
stroke patients [27], [28]. The magnitude of motor improvement as indexed by the JTT was 9.4% in Baggio’s study, 6.7%
in Fregni’s study and 8.9% in Hummel’s study. All these studies showed that active anodal tDCS, which could increase motor cortical excitability, improved the motor function by nearly
10% for both healthy subjects and stroke patients. Therefore,
the average classification performance improvement (10.1%)
of the affected side across the subjects was comparable with
these previous studies. For the amputees, their affected side
had not been used for an extended period of time, which could

PAN et al.: IMPROVING MYOELECTRIC CONTROL FOR AMPUTEES THROUGH TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION

decrease the excitability of corresponding motor cortex. Thus,
the ability of the amputees to voluntarily access limb movement
representations at the affected side was reduced. Because anodal tDCS increased the motor cortical excitability, following
the demonstrated intervention based on active anodal tDCS
of the motor cortex corresponding to the affected side, the
amputees could voluntarily access limb movement representations better. As a result, the amputees could activate consistent
(same motion) and distinctive (different motions) EMG patterns,
and the myoelectric control performance could be significantly
improved.
F. Future Work
The present study has only investigated the peripheral activities, i.e., EMG signals. It can be inferred that some changes must
have happened at the cortical level following tDCS. In the future, we plan to simultaneously collect EMG and brain signals,
such as fMRI and EEG signals, to directly evaluate the differences of the motor cortex excitability between the pre-tDCS and
post-tDCS sessions.
To better understand the changes of muscle activation patterns
after anodal tDCS, a high-density surface EMG signal acquisition system may be adopted to decompose the signals into
individual spike trains of motor unit action potentials, which
correspond to firing characteristics of motor neurons [47], [48].
Also, there is a limitation of present study that the subjects
are only trained for short time on the first day. Actually, the
short-term training cannot accomplish a complete clinical improvement on myoelectric control performance. It is found that
the performance will be stable after long-term training [12]. Future work should be conducted to evaluate the effect of anodal
tDCS under the condition that the training effect is minimized.
There is only one day of active anodal tDCS in present study.
Daily tDCS for multiple days is likely necessary to establish a
long-lasting improvement of classification performance of EMG
signals in the future. As this work is an off-line analysis, an online study should be taken into account as well. In the online
study, JTT should be adopted to evaluate the effect of tDCS on
the motor function of amputee users in control of myoelectric
prostheses based on pattern recognition.
V. CONCLUSION
Neuromodulation, like tDCS, is a novel method to improve
the quality of EMG signals for myoelectric prosthesis control.
This work showed that active anodal tDCS could significantly
enhance EMG classification performance for the affected side
of the amputees. Through a short 20-min active anodal tDCS
intervention, the amputees could generate more consistent and
distinguishable EMG patterns. The method proposed has huge
potential in helping prosthesis users to produce desired EMG
patterns quickly and easily, so that the long and difficult user
training phase for pattern recognition-based myoelectric control can be dramatically reduced. This proposed approach is
likely to be a crucial step in improving user compliance of
myoelectrically-controlled multifunctional prostheses.
