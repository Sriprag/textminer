Abstract—Many platforms have emerged as response to the
call for technology supporting active and healthy aging. Key requirements for any such e-health systems and any subsequent
business exploitation are tailor-made design and proper evaluation. This paper presents the design, implementation, wide deployment, and evaluation of the low cost, physical exercise, and
gaming (exergaming) FitForAll (FFA) platform system usability,
user adherence to exercise, and efficacy are explored. The design of FFA is tailored to elderly populations, distilling literature
guidelines and recommendations. The FFA architecture introduces
standard physical exercise protocols in exergaming software engineering, as well as, standard physical assessment tests for augmented adaptability through adjustable exercise intensity. This
opens up the way to next generation exergaming software, which
may be more automatically/smartly adaptive. 116 elderly users piloted FFA five times/week, during an eight-week controlled intervention. Usability evaluation was formally conducted (SUS, SUMI
questionnaires). Control group consisted of a size-matched elderly
group following cognitive training. Efficacy was assessed objectively through the senior fitness (Fullerton) test, and subjectively,
through WHOQoL-BREF comparisons of pre–postintervention
between groups. Adherence to schedule was measured by attendance logs. The global SUMI score was 68.33±5.85%, while SUS
was 77.7. Good usability perception is reflected in relatively high
adherence of 82% for a daily two months pilot schedule. Compared
to control group, elderly using FFA improved significantly strength,
flexibility, endurance, and balance while presenting a significant
trend in quality of life improvements. This is the first elderly focused exergaming platform intensively evaluated with more than
100 participants. The use of formal tools makes the findings comparable to other studies and forms an elderly exergaming corpus.
Index Terms—Efficacy assessment, elderly care intervention,

I. INTRODUCTION
ITH population age increasing across developed countries, independent and healthy lifestyle of elderly population becomes an increasingly important social issue [1]. It
is documented that regular physical activity is essential for
healthy aging [2], [3]. The American College of Sports Medicine
(ACSM) and the American Heart Association (AHA) define
protocols, guidelines, and recommendations regarding the exact type and intensity of elderly exercise regimens [2]–[5].
Technology assisted solutions engaging the elderly in physical exercise or activity through gaming have been in focus of
an increasing number of research efforts. A novel portmanteau
term “exergaming” has even been coined to describe this notion
[6], which, if correctly implemented, greatly increases elderly
motivation and adherence to physical exercise and activity regimens [7]–[12].
After several years of study, the effects of exergaming are
now well documented. Positive mood changes [13]–[15], socialization enhancement [16], [17], improved confidence with
everyday functional activities [18], and overall quality of life
improvement [2], [19] have been documented.
Additionally, a significant volume of studies has, albeit with
a limited number of participants over short trial durations, explored the formal establishment of recommendations and guidelines for elderly exergaming design [14], [20]. Correct pacing
[14], [21], appropriate in-game feedback [21] and adequate socialization provisions [11], [22], [23] have been formalized as
guidelines in the literature.
There are several commercial or custom exergaming platforms available [9], [16], [21], [22]. The majority of these solutions, however, with interfaces stemming from nonelderly specific interaction requirements, demonstrate learning overheads
and familiarity barriers for elderly users, which in turn reduce
their overall efficacy [11], [12], [15], [24]–[27]. Additionally,
off-the-shelf commercial products, utilized in exergaming interventions, lack elderly user engagement and exercise efficacy
since they focus on promoting physical activity without elderly
specific exercise regimens [19], [21], [27]–[31]. Custom exergaming solutions mostly follow design guidelines and best
practices focused in specific intervention types such as balance
improvement [8], [9], [15], [18], [30], [32], [33]–[35], instead
of exploring overall physical well being of elders.

Summarizing, significant gaps emerge when examining exergaming studies and interventions for active and healthy aging. There are, conspicuously, only a few studies making any
attempt at formal assessment of the usability of computer/webbased exergaming platforms [16], [26]. What is more, an overall
“prototype” attitude [20] is often encountered: studies focus on
demonstrating efficacy on rather small user samples rather than
following formal usability testing on large cohorts. Indeed, a
significantly greater number of studies explore intervention efficacies through standardized survey methods [8]–[10], [15],
[18], [19], [25], [35], [36], but with methodological generalization obstacles in their findings due to small participant cohorts
and short evaluation periods [7]–[9], [13]–[15], [18], [19], [22],
[24]–[38]. Quite obviously, follow up (repeated measures) tests
in specific time periods (e.g., 6 months, 12 months, etc.) after
initial trial would also be building up on evidence.
Last but not least, recent neuroscientific [39] and neuropsychological [40] reviews on game-based elderly interventions
emphasize the importance of naturalistic or personally meaningful environments and designs that should be inducing a mismatch of supply and demand, with high task variability, fulfilling
basic individual senior needs, but be engaging, so as to maximize
long-term adherence.
Presented here is the assessment of a rigorously designed,
low cost, custom exergaming platform, utilizing off-the-shelf
contemporary controller hardware. This paper is the first in
the field that utilizes validated standard tests to assess intervention impact as well as platform usability. Additionally, this
is the first controlled study combining relatively large sample
sizes (n>200) with a rigorous intervention program (2 months,
5 d/week) providing results, which could be generalized and
form the baseline for future similar efforts. The objective of this
paper is to evaluate whether elderly tailored exergaming systems can be user friendly and effective enough to achieve good
physical exercise adherence and to improve the quality of life.
This effectiveness requires rigorous adherence to established
exercise protocols and valid assessment of physical status in
order to dynamically adjust the physical challenges to the elderly users according to their needs and abilities [14], [20], [21],
[24], [25]. The architectural challenge stemming from this overall objective is the incorporation of standard physical exercise
protocols and standard physical assessment tests in exergaming
software engineering practice.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section
II, the FitForAll (FFA) exergaming platform and its architecture
are presented alongside the design principles and criteria used.
In order to give a clear view at the methodology used for the evaluation of the system in terms of usability and efficacy, a section
of the methodology deals with the intervention and the evaluation tools as well as the participant samples. A final methodology section presents details of the statistical analysis methodology to be used for the extraction of results. In Section III,
the evaluation outcome in terms of usability, efficacy, and adherence are illustrated. At the end of this paper, Section IV puts
the threads together by shedding light on the conducted evaluation and its outcomes in the light of current research work on

the field of serious exergaming for elderly, along with research
limitations and further envisaged work.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. FFA Exergaming Platform
The FFA platform consists of specifically designed games
aiming at elderly exercise and maintenance/advancement of
healthy physical status and well being. FFA offers elderly specific exercises within an engaging game environment aiming
at promoting physical exercise protocol adherence. Fig. 1 illustrates information as well as interaction layers between the
users (seniors) and the FFA system. Through contemporary
controllers (Nintendo Wii Remote Controller, Nintendo Wii
BalanceBoard—Fig. 1: hardware layer) FFA: 1) captures sensory information such as acceleration, or body mass transfer
by translating user body movements and postures (see Fig. 1
physical layer); 2) converts them to game input (see Fig. 1 data
layer) and compares them with the physical exercise and gameplay objectives (see Fig. 1 semantic layer); 3) updates the game
scenario accordingly (see Fig. 1 game layer); and 4) provides
appropriate forms of feedback (see Fig. 1 presentation layer)
to the senior (see Fig. 1 outcome layer). The Fullerton [41], an
overall physical assessment test (see Fig. 1 data layer), evaluates the seniors’ physical status progress, based on their profile
(see Fig. 1 user profile), and adjusts the exercise intensity and
difficulty level accordingly.
The implementation of the application was based on the .NET
framework. The main application encapsulated the communication with peripherals input devices based on the managed library
for Nintendo’s Wiimote [42]. Filtering and algorithmic processing of the controllers’ acquired signal, as well as, identification
of inconsistencies in calculation of body posture and gestures

participants [25].

and their correction are accommodated after the acquisition process. The Microsoft XNA Game Studio [43] was employed for
the rendering of 2-D and 3-D graphics. The 2-D graphics were
images, while the 3-D objects were simple 3-D models edited
in 3-Ds Max Studio and Google Sketchup.
B. FFA Game Design Principles and Considerations
The design of the games that comprise FFA was guided by
tapping into expert knowledge from established protocols of
exercise used for facilitating a healthy lifestyle for the elderly.
Specifically, several such physical training protocols were dissected and the recommended standard physical exercises that
are their building blocks were identified and recorded [3], [5].
Afterwards, a game was designed for each exercise that incorporated in its control scheme the required physical exercise
(cf., Fig. 2). The game encapsulated the exercise in an interesting and attractive, for the specific age group, game concept [44], by adhering (during design) to a cohort of guidelines and recommendations. The latter were identified in the
literature [21] or provided by the experts’ experience. Table I summarizes the identified guidelines and recommendations along with the FFA approaches, respectively [21]. The
vast majority of them have been extracted by implications in the

The elementary component of the FFA platform is the game.
Focusing on the senior’s game experience, each game is formed
as a goal-oriented activity through a virtual environment, with
simple and understandable graphics (cf., Fig. 5). The physical
task/exercise (physical activity objective) is accomplished in
conjunction with the in-game goal (game objective), while the
player’s performance is tracked. Interaction with the game is
event based, triggered when a game’s logic rule is met [cf.,
Fig. 5(A)–(C)]. Events provide either real-time notifications
about goal achievements (result events) [cf., Fig. 5(C)] or guidance on appropriate task execution and successful completion
(action events) [cf. Fig. 5(B)]. In FFA, the combination of games
in an ordered sequence, configured to specific physical exercise
objectives, instantiates a physical training “session,” which may
stand on its own or be part of a whole intervention protocol,
as FFA is integrated into a full elderly assisted living system
through the use of web services [45] and (health) user records
[46], [47]. Health care providers are able to add or modify
games, sessions, and therapies through a native interface (cf.,
Fig. 3). Forming a session is achieved by selecting a cohort of
games and defining their order and parameters, which will affect the overall exercise difficulty. A pool of supported games
is available to therapist-users during a session’s elaboration.
The full game suite (cf., Figs. 5 and 6) is composed of aerobic, strength, balance, and flexibility computerized exercises
blended with games. The following game types compose the
game suite. In hiking or cycling (aerobic exercises), seniors are
supposed to march on the spot or cycle on a stationary mini
bike; FFA makes use of an avatar moving through a city landscape to render exercise enjoyable [cf., Fig. 5(A)]. In ski jump
(strength, flexibility), the senior is to move the center of mass
to a specific position, thus controlling an avatar’s jump performance (maximum length travelled) [cf., Fig. 5(B)]. In the
well-known Arkanoid (dynamic balance), seniors control the
horizontal position of a bar and attempt hitting a moving ball
(directed to destroy bricks) [cf., Fig. 5(C)]. In another dynamic
balance game, Apple Tree, seniors move to control a basket
picking apples from a tree [cf., Fig. 5(D)]. Likewise, in fishing
(dynamic balance too), seniors control the vertical position of a
boat, which attempts fishing the horizontally moving fishes [cf.,
Fig. 5(E)]. In mini golf, seniors move their center of mass and
attempt to put a ball into a hole by overcoming different barriers
[cf., Fig. 5(F)]. Finally, numerous exercise tasks increase upper
and lower limb strength by weightlifting and resistance gaming exercises, while stretching and warm-up exercises account
for flexibility training. Senior feedback and overall reward is
empowered by pictures of positive valence, which are revealed
gradually with increasing repetitions and upon completion in an
effort to engage seniors.

troller devices and its parameters in terms of auto connectivity
are configured by the FFA administration panel (see Fig. 3).
Upon system launching, the senior is guided by an intuitive
interface to connect the controller devices [cf., Fig. 6(A)]. Once
connection is established, the senior is able to choose either the
training session that FFA automatically recommends or one of
the available training sessions [cf., Fig. 6(B)]. Before the game
environment is launched, auxiliary interfaces offer instructions
about the game play and the physical task to be undertaken [cf.,
Fig. 6(D)]. After reading the instructions, the senior may press
the start button to continue. A short count-down prepares the
user before the game. Additionally, the senior is able to pause
or skip a game at any time by simply touching the screen [cf.,
Fig. 6(F)].

D. System Setup, Launching, and Game Navigation
Since connectivity and setup of the Wii devices, through the
Bluetooth stack provided tool, is a tricky task for inexperienced
senior users, FFA implements an auto connect functionality by
utilizing the Bluesoleil Bluetooth stack API. The default con-

by the FFA through Wiimote (attached on the arm or the leg)
to measure number of arm’s curls [cf., Fig. 4(A)], number of
stand ups from a chair [cf., Fig. 4(B)], time to cover predefined
distance [cf., Fig. 4(C)], and number of steps in a predefined
time allotment [cf., Fig. 4(D)]. The other two of the six tasks
are simply measured by the seniors and entered manually to the
system by an intuitive virtual keyboard on the screen. Following
the design guidelines, each task is accompanied by detailed and
illustrated instructions. Performance improvement in at least
three Fullerton tasks is required for promoting the seniors to the
next difficulty level, while deterioration to at least two tasks is
enough for a level decrease.

exercise intensity component (e.g., more repetitions per exercise), which is the dominant one and the gameplay difficulty
(e.g., avoid obstacles during the golf game). Apart from the
option of creating/modifying interventions, FFA incorporates
a default intervention protocol, tailored to elderly [3], which
consists of four difficulty levels. The first level promotes light
exercise, while the last one promotes more intensive physical
exercise. Periodically, a formative assessment [48], by means
of a short computerized subset of the Fullerton test (cf., Fig. 4),
is requested to be performed by the seniors prior to the intervention’s session. Four of the six Fullerton tasks are facilitated

The FFA platform was widely used and evaluated during the
trials of the Long Lasting Memories (LLM) project funded by
EU [49]–[51]. In compliance to the ACSM/AHA recommendations [3], an appropriate number of training sessions was
created. Each trainee had to accomplish 20-min aerobic exercises, 8–10 resistance exercises, 10-min flexibility exercise, and
a set of balance targeted exercises. The warm-up and cool-down
processes constituted the initial and final session’s components,
respectively. Exercise intensity was constant per session but
was gradually increased, based on the formative assessment,
throughout the whole intervention to meet fitness level improvements [3], [4], [52]. Exercises kick-off at the light intensity level
with a target to reach 50–60% maximum heart rate (HRmax)
and can proceed to the very hard level with a target set at 80–
90% of HRmax. The intervention was conducted on a series of
elderly user groups [cf., Fig. 7] and was supervised by formal

the application the users feel), learnability (how quickly users
feel they were able to master the application), and one overall scale (Global) (see Table III). Additionally, participants also
completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) [54], a “quick and
dirty” survey scale on usability. Finally, an ancillary set of questions, focusing on the platform’s impact on the elderly, ease of
use and its potential as a commercial product.
An attendance log was used for measuring the adherence to
schedule. Each participant was asked to accomplish five daily
sessions per week. While not all of the participants managed
to follow this intensive schedule, all managed to complete the
required total sessions (set at a minimum of 16). Adherence was
measured as the ratio of the number of participation sessions
over the number of planned sessions.
On the efficacy front, the senior fitness (Fullerton) test [41]
was chosen as an index of elderly fitness. Assessing upper
and lower body strength, upper and lower body flexibility,
agility/dynamic balance, and level of aerobic endurance, this test
was performed to both participant groups (FFA intervention and
control). Additionally, improvements in quality of life (QOL)
were assessed through the WHOQoL-BREF [55] questionnaire,
which addresses four QOL domains: physical/psychological
health, social relationships, and environment (4–20 range scale).
H. Participants and System Use

caregivers. For comparison, an (active) control group was used
which, instead of the FFA intervention, received cognitive training, identical in terms of total duration and session intensity as
well as grouping attributes. The whole study was ecologically
valid and was conducted in numerous settings in Thessaloniki
(Greece) within: day care centers of the Greek Association of
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders; municipal social
care centers as well as senior centers; and local parish community centers.
G. Evaluation Method
Both subjective and objective measures were used to evaluate the FFA platform. Evaluation was conducted mainly in two
fronts, the user level (usability, adherence) and the efficacy level
(fitness impact, Quality of Life Impact). User experience was
evaluated through the (standard) Software Usability Measurement Inventory (SUMI) questionnaire [53]. SUMI may report
results on efficiency (to which extent users feel that the software helps them), affect (user’s emotional reaction), helpfulness (intuitiveness and ease of use), control (how in-control of

FFA was the physical training component in the LLM project
[51]. Thus, a relatively large number (415) of European senior
citizens engaged with it for a minimum of 2–3 times per week
for a total duration of 7–8 weeks according to the LLM database
records [46]. The system was used for 6231 sessions between
2010–2012; each session lasted for approximately 60 min. For
the purposes of this paper, however, the rigorous evaluation procedure described earlier was trialed and successfully completed
only by 116 of those (28%) participants. Likewise, the control
group for the purposes of this study, which was conducted in
Thessaloniki (Greece) consisted of a demographically similar
group of 116 participants. Specifically, inclusion criteria for both
the intervention and the control group were: age ࣙ60, fluent language skills, normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing,
examination and formal permission from a cardiologist, and
time commitment followed by a signed informed consent (obtained prior to trial commencement). A dropout was considered
by means of not achieving the minimum number of sessions
(16) or five consecutive absences (FFA dropout rate was 21.2%
as opposed to 22.2% for the controls). No financial incentive
was provided to participants. The protocol was approved by the
Ethical Boards of the Greek Association of Alzheimer’s Disease
and Related Disorders and the Medical School of the Aristotle
University of Thessaloniki.
I. Statistical Analysis
Since standard usability tools were used, our analysis followed well-defined literature procedures. SUMI questionnaire
data were transformed so as to be comparable against the SUMISCO standard database average, fixed at “50” for each of the
scales. Mean and standard deviation (SD) values of the Global

and the five additional subscales were calculated. Likewise, the
SUS score was normalized and transformed to percentiles, allowing the usability of the developed system to be comparable
against a corpus of more than 5000 SUS observations [56]. This
provides an indicator of the overall usability of FFA as a system.
Efficacy data were analyzed using the statistical software
SPSS v.21 for Windows. Chi-square analysis was used to test
for gender and age differences between intervention and control groups. Nonparametric models were chosen for the physical fitness and QOL data analysis as the majority of variables
were not normally distributed. For continuous variables preand postintervention changes, within groups, were analyzed
with the Wilcoxon signed rank test, while the Mann–Whitney
U test was used for the differences (post–preintervention and
post–precontrol) between intervention and control groups, respectively. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables are
represented by mean±SD, while an effect was considered statistically significant if a p-value of less than 0.05 was obtained.
III. RESULTS
In both groups, female participants have been the majority
(see Table II) in agreement with what is widely reported in
relevant literature [9], [16], [18], [31], [36], [57]. Although participants of both groups were asked to use the system five days
per week, average FFA attendance was four days/week, achieving a total mean of some 25 sessions. No statistically significant
differences were observed between groups with respect to age
(p = 0.287) or gender (p = 0.331) (see Table II).
SUMI results appear in Table III. Values for efficiency, helpfulness, control, learnability, and global score are all above 60%.
This puts the FFA platform well above the mean scores of the
SUMISCO database when considering levels of user satisfaction.

Fig. 8. Intervention adherence as a histogram of the proportion of sessions
attended by FFA participants with respect to the planned sessions.

The mean raw SUS score was 76.36 with no participant rating below 50%, while the normalized score was 77.7% [56].
Training schedule adherence was found to be good enough, that
is, 82%, as shown in the histogram of Fig. 8.
Table IV contains efficacy results (post–preintervention differences). Concerning the physical assessment test, the intervention group showed statistically significant difference to all
the domains of the test in contrast with the control group. The
8-Foot-Up-And-Go refers to time, and thus, lower score is translated to better mobility and dynamic balance.
The within group comparisons show statistically significant
differences regarding pre- and postresults to all the domains of
the intervention group, while only lower body strength was improved in the control group (but in obviously lower levels than
the intervention group). Regarding QOL assessment, the intervention group, compared with the control group, showed statistically significant difference to the three first domains. However,
the differences post–preinterventions within the same group are
statistically significant in both the intervention and the control
group in domain 4 suggesting that improvement in this domain
was observed on both the intervention and the control group.
On the qualitative questionnaires, 96.6% reported that the
FFA intervention has improved their social life and helped them
meet new people and 85.4% perceived that the FFA platform
allows them to control their health better. Additionally, 87.1%
of the users reported that with a maximum of five days familiarization with the platform they were able to use it without
help, while another 92.2% reported that they considered this as
a commercial level quality ICT platform, worth paying for if it
was ever marketed.
IV. DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first elderly focused exergaming
platform evaluated on a daily basis through an eight-week intervention with more than 100 participants. On the usability front,
the results are very encouraging indeed: they enhance existing
literature, which lacks of exergames usability assessments in a

standardized way [16], [26]. This is of paramount importance
if exergaming/serious games platforms are supposed to be designed not only as prototype systems, but as products with an
aimed readiness level good enough to be introduced into the
healthy and active aging market [20].
The results obtained with FFA show that its market readiness
is good enough, as the global scores of SUMI and SUS indicate,
thereby interpreting the high levels of users’ perception on usability. As already mentioned before (cf., Table I), commonly
accepted design considerations for developing exergames for
elderly [11], [14], [21], [22], [25] are highly related to usability,
which seems to be a vulnerable point in commercial platforms
for general audiences [12], [21], [24], [28]. The high individual
scores of the SUMI scale imply that the FFA platform is tailored
to the elderly population. Controllability and learnability scores,
the lowest of the rest, while well above the average, are justified
since the user base consisted of elderly users with implicit issues
in acquiring new knowledge, and subsequently, utilizing novel
control schemes [16], [58].
Our findings are also consistent with conclusions of earlier
studies that exalted the role of exergames usability and enjoyment [15], [59] to that of motivation and adherence to the physical exercise protocol [8], [10], [12], [14], [25], [28], [30], [32].
While the achieved adherence level (82%) is in line with previous studies [19], our results should be considered within the general context of intensive schedules requiring a five day weekly
attendance.
A multidimensional, moderately intense activity program that
includes endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility training is
generally considered optimal for older adults [10], [52] con-

trary to vigorous activity [2]–[4], which affects adherence negatively [3]. Fullerton posttest improvements of FFA participants
along with the high schedule adherence levels demonstrate that
the FFA platform provided not only the aforementioned high
schedule adherence, but a high physical exercise adherence too.
Moreover, Fullerton results show statistically significant improvements for all domains of physical outcomes, in contrary
to the vast majority of literature, which reports either improvements simply in balance or merely some trends in physical
improvements [10], [18], [25], [27], [28], [30]. In our case,
the FFA group improves significantly with respect to the control group in all levels. It is interesting to note, however, that
there existed a statistically significant postintervention difference in lower body strength in the control group as well. This
could be attributed to controls’ engagement for routine walking activity (the majority of controls also had to walk from
home to pilot site where the study was conducted a few times
a week; thus there were performing some latent routine aerobic
exercise).
The greatest improvement of the WHOQoL-BREF score was
observed in overall living environment and psychology (including but not limited to evaluation of positive/negative feelings,
self-esteem, memory, and concentration) in consistency with
other findings [27]. This could possibly be attributed to the
positive effect of video game playing on participants’ mood
as reported in recent literature [13], [14]. Naturally and expectedly, the physical aspect of life quality was significantly
improved.
Finally, the social domain of the WHOQoL-BREF survey
revealed no statistically significant improvement during the

KONSTANTINIDIS et al.: DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, AND WIDE PILOT DEPLOYMENT OF FITFORALL

intervention. However, the between group difference was statistically significant, thereby probably indicating that FFA’s social
impact was significantly more relevant than the simple socialization experienced by the control group.
From the technical viewpoint, the architecture of this study
incorporated a computerized subset of Fullerton as a formative
assessment component (see Fig. 1 data layer, Fullerton assessment) for purposes of augmented adaptability and adjustable
difficulty. Contrary to other works which consider the difficulty
only on the gameplay axis (objects’ speed and size, controllers
sensitivity, etc.) [9], [21], [33], the realization of the FFA architecture perceived the difficulty in two axes: the gameplay
difficulty as well as the physical exercise load. In order for an appropriately validated set of physical challenges to be presented
in each elderly user, an equally formal, validated way needed to
be incorporated as a criterion for modifying the physical exercise load. In that context, it was essential that the introduction of
a formal assessment instrument, such as the Fullerton, needed to
be incorporated as a formative assessment tool in the platform’s
architecture.
Equally important is the fact that this is the first exergame,
to the best of the author’s knowledge, that incorporates in its
architecture design and implementation the standard physical
exercise component (see Fig. 1 semantic layer, physical exercise
objectives), which refers to planned, structured, and repetitive
movement to improve or maintain one or more components of
physical fitness, contrary to physical activity, which refers to
body movement that is produced by the contraction of skeletal
muscles and that increases energy expenditure [2]. This essentially opens up the way to the next generation of exergaming
platforms, which may be adaptive in a smart way. In fact, the
augmented effects of the standard physical exercise may be the
cause of the high adherence since the elders consider using a
system if it is useful, reliable, and provides obvious benefits
to their lifestyle [60]. Especially, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are considered as the main predictors of
technology acceptance [61]. With this in mind, the consideration of standard physical exercises during design and implementation could serve as an additional guideline for exergaming
design. This implies, as also suggested by our results regarding
perception of better health control, that incorporating standard
physical exercises to exergames augments the observable effect
to the physical state of the seniors. As a consequence, this would
increase elderly acceptance of exergaming as a legitimate intervention for maintaining a healthy and independent lifestyle, and
thus, perceived as useful for them. According to the literature
[60], such an effect could lead to increased adherence, and finally, to successful promotion of exercise to the elderly people.
This could be complementary to the initial motivation, which
stems from the joyful experience of the “gaming” component
of the exergames [7]–[12], and also could be the cause for sustaining this motivation.
A. Limitations
Despite the relatively large sample size of this paper and the
exploitation of a cohort of validated tests, some limitations must

197

be outlined too. As mentioned, comparisons were done against
a nonphysically active group that engaged merely in cognitive exercises. A comparison with a physically active control
(conventional physical exercises, like dancing) would further
empower our findings. Additionally, this study involved intervention groups with the added social factor possibly influencing
the elderly users’ perception regarding adherence and QOL. Furthermore, even though this study consists of one of the longest
durations in the field of exergaming studies, adherence would
be better supported by even longer trials (six months or more).
From the technical viewpoint, the partial implementation of the
assessment test (four out of six tasks) was a hard limitation
of the Wii devices, which is going to be alleviated as soon as
technology permits.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper reports on the design, implementation and thorough evaluation through a wide pilot deployment of the FFA
exergaming platform for senior users. Formal assessment was
carried out along two main axes, namely, on user and efficacy
levels. On the usability front, we provide strong evidence that
such interventions are feasible and may be implemented through
contemporary IT systems capable of motivating seniors to engage with a healthy physical activity program. On the efficacy
axis, quite expectedly, our study provides strong evidence of
physical improvement by means of clinical tests, but more surprisingly, an even more significant discovery, is the evidence
that the platform improved the general wellness and quality of
life of its user base. Furthermore, the FFA demonstrated a viable
architecture for incorporating a standard of physical exercises
as well as a computerized subset of Fullerton for accomplishing
the physical status formative assessment toward adjustability
and adaptability. On top of this, the mapping of the guidelines
and the architecture concept to the actual implementation of
FFA provides a concrete illustrative proof of application for the
aforementioned design paradigms.
The relatively large sample size used, in tandem with the exploited assessment battery, may serve as a reference/baseline
for assessing similar platforms in the future. Evolving and improving access to such a database by providing (semantic web)
ways to exploit the underlying big data structures offers an unprecedented opportunity certainly worth exploiting [62]. Likewise, the multimodal evaluation methodology could contribute
to the evolution of a gold standard for exergames evaluation
methodology and the results could probably serve as an initial
base for future exergames’ evaluation since this field gains great
importance nowadays. Future studies could also assess the neuropsychological and neuroscientific impact of the FFA approach
[39], [63], [64]. Last but not least, the obtained herein qualitative
feedback with regards to the likely marketability of the product
has not only been taken seriously into account, but already lead
to a series of business efforts in Greece and elsewhere. We deem
these achievements as key response elements of the biomedical
engineering and health informatics scientific communities to the
call for technologically supporting active and healthy aging and
the adoption of future mobile/e-health systems.
