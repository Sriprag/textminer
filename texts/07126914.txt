Abstract—A cross-sectional study on patients with early-stage
multiple sclerosis (MS) was conducted to examine the reliability
of manual and automatic mobility measures derived from shankmounted inertial sensors during the Timed Up and Go (TUG)
test, compared to control subjects. Furthermore, we aimed to determine if disease status [as measured by the Multiple Sclerosis
Impact Scale (MSIS-20) and the Expanded Disability Status Score
(EDSS)] can be explained by measurements obtained using inertial
sensors. We also aimed to determine if patients with early-stage MS
could be automatically distinguished from healthy controls subjects, using inertial parameters recorded during the TUG test. The
mobility of 38 patients (aged 25–65 years, 14 M, 24 F), diagnosed
with relapsing-remitting MS and 33 healthy controls (14 M, 19 F,
age 50–65), was assessed using the TUG test, while patients wore inertial sensors on each shank. Reliability analysis showed that 36 of
53 mobility parameters obtained during the TUG showed excellent
intrasession reliability, while nine of 53 showed moderate reliability. This compared favorably with the reliability of the mobility
parameters in healthy controls. Exploratory regression models of
the EDSS and MSIS-20 scales were derived, using mobility parameters and an elastic net procedure in order to determine which
mobility parameters influence disease state. A cross-validated elastic net regularized regression model for MSIS-20 yielded a mean
square error (MSE) of 1.1 with 10 degrees of freedom (DoF). Similarly, an elastic net regularized regression model for EDSS yielded a
cross-validated MSE of 1.3 with 10 DoF. Classification results show
that the mobility parameters of participants with early-stage MS
could be distinguished from controls with 96.90% accuracy. Results suggest that mobility parameters derived from MS patients
while completing the TUG test are reliable, are associated with disease state in MS, and may have utility in screening for early-stage
MS.

I. INTRODUCTION
ULTIPLE sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive neurological disorder affecting between 2 and 2.5 million
people globally [1]. Impaired mobility is a common symptom
of MS, even at lower levels of the disease, and has significant
negative effects on quality of life [2]. Current best practice for
clinical assessment of MS includes assessment of gait and mobility. Quantitative assessment of mobility using inertial sensors
has the potential to provide objective longitudinal monitoring of
patients with MS. The Expanded Disease Status Scale (EDSS)
[3] is a ten-point scale, zero indicates normal neurological exam,
while higher values indicating greater disability and eventual
death. It is one of the gold standard clinical measures of disability in MS with the higher end of the scales being very dependent on a patient’s mobility. Similarly, the Multiple Sclerosis
Impact Scale (MSIS) [4] is a 29-point clinical scale containing 20 physical items (MSIS-20) with higher values indicating
greater impairment (ranging from 20 to 100). The relationships
between quantitative measures of mobility and clinical status (as
measured by the MSIS and the EDSS) in patients with relapsing
remitting (RR) MS have not yet been explored.
The time taken to complete the Timed Up and Go (TUG)
test [5] has been shown to be a threshold test for independent
living and a predictor of frailty and falls [6], [7]. The TUG test
is commonly used for assessing risk of falls in older adults [8].
Recent research has investigated the use of inertial sensors for
quantitative evaluation of gait [9], [10] and to quantify movement in the TUG test [10], [11]. Spain et al. [12] used inertial
sensors and the TUG test to compare the balance and gait of
people with MS (with normal walking speeds), against healthy
controls. They found that inertial sensor parameters could distinguish between MS patients and controls, but did not attempt
to classify participants automatically into the two groups. Further research by Spain et al. [13] has reported on a sample of
27 patients with MS, inertial sensors capture variation between
trials but not was sensitive in identifying decline, of gait and balance measures over 18 months. Carpinella et al. [14] employed
a wrist-mounted inertial sensor to examine upper limb function movements in MS. They found significant differences in
movement patterns between patients and controls. Higashi et al.
[15] employed body-worn gyroscopes to evaluate movement in
hemiplegic patients with pathological gait while performing the
TUG test. Salarian et al. [10] showed that a TUG test quantified
with inertial sensors was both a reliable and sensitive method

for quantifying gait and mobility in Parkinson’s disease patients.
Similarly, Weiss et al. [11] used a waist-mounted body-worn accelerometers to quantify the gait of Parkinson’s disease patients
during the TUG test and found that accelerometer-derived parameters are sensitive to group differences between Parkinson’s
patients and controls.
This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the reliability
of a combination of manually timed and inertial sensor derived
mobility measures derived from inertial sensors mounted on the
lower limbs during the TUG test. Furthermore, we aimed to
determine if disease status for patients with relapsing remitting
MS can be estimated by assessment of gait and turning using inertial sensors. We also aimed to determine if inertial sensor data
obtained during a mobility assessment can be used to automatically distinguish between early-stage MS patients and healthy
controls.
II. PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS
The gait and mobility of 38 participants (24 female, aged
25–65 years, height: 168.9 ± 9.0 cm, weight: 76.5 ± 21.3 kg)
were assessed at the Neurology Outpatient Department in St
Vincent’s University hospital, Dublin, Ireland. All participants
were diagnosed as having relapsing remitting MS. Each participant received a comprehensive neurological examination which
included a full medical and MS history, the MSIS (MSIS-20),
the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Symbol Digit
Modalities Test (SDMT). Each participant’s MS disease state
was also assessed using the Expanded Disability Status Score
(EDSS).
Clinical information on the cohort is supplied in Table I. The
inclusion criteria were participants aged between 18 and 65,
diagnosed with clinically definite relapsing remitting MS and
not initially on disease modifying therapy (DMT). The exclusion
criteria were chronic diseases other than MS (e.g., Parkinson’s),
primary or secondary progressive MS or a participant on DMT.
Ethical approval was received from the St Vincent’s University
Hospital research ethics committee and all participants provided
written informed consent.
Mobility was assessed using inertial sensor data recorded during a standard mobility test (TUG); instrumented with inertial
sensors.
The MS data were compared against data from a cohort of
33 healthy control subjects “controls,” aged between 55 and
65 years old (19 female; age: 59.8 ± 2.7 years; height: 167.2 ±
7.5 cm; weight: 74.3 ± 13.4 kg).
Ethical approval was obtained from the University College
Dublin ethics committee. All participants provided informed
consent and were recruited through a university staff mailing list
and a local area information bulletin. Control participants did
not suffer from any neurological or musculoskeletal disorders.
III. METHODS
A. Test Protocol
Each participant was asked to perform three consecutive TUG
tests [5], “as fast as safely possible,” by getting up from a

standard chair (46-cm high seat, 65-cm arm-rests), walking three
meters, turning at a designated spot, returning to the seat, and
sitting down. The clinician started the timer the moment they
said “go,” stopping the timer the moment the participant sat back
on the chair. The task was demonstrated to each participant and
participants were allowed to use the chair arm-rests, were given
time to familiarize themselves with the test, and allowed to rest
between tests.
B. Sensor Data Acquisition
For each TUG test, participants were fitted with two wireless
inertial sensors that were attached by a clinician or research
assistant, using elasticized bandages, to the mid-point of each
anterior shank (shin) [16]. Inertial sensor data (see Fig. 1) were
synchronously acquired in real time via Bluetooth using dedicated software (QTUG, Kinesis; Dublin, Ireland). Each sensor
contained a triaxial accelerometer and a triaxial gyroscope and
sampled at 102.4 Hz and had a full-scale range of 500 °/s a

sensitivity of 2 mV/°/s. Sensors were calibrated using a standard
method [17]. The raw gyroscope signal was low pass filtered
with zero-phase second-order Butterworth filter with a 20-Hz
corner frequency. Data acquisition software automatically connected to the relevant sensors allowed the clinician/researcher to
start and stop the test recording manually as with a stopwatch.
Data were automatically saved to text format for subsequent
offline analysis.
C. Sensor Feature Extraction
The mobility of each participant performing the TUG test was
evaluated using a previously reported method for quantitative
assessment of mobility [7], [16]. Features were calculated from
the angular velocity signals obtained from the triaxial gyroscope
sensors mounted on each shank. The 53 included features can
be grouped into five categories: manually timed, temporal gait
parameters, spatial gait parameters, triaxial angular velocity parameters, and turn parameters.
D. Statistical Analysis
1) Reliability Analysis: Intraclass correlation coefficients
(ICCs), a measure of consistency [18], were calculated to assess the intrasession test–retest reliability for both MS patients
and controls; within session, reliability was calculated for each
variable using ICC(2,k), 95% confidence intervals. Reliability
results for MS patients and controls are provided in Table II.
2) Exploratory Data Analysis: The elastic net regularization
regression procedure [19] was used to derive explanatory regression models of the EDSS and MSIS-20 scores for all participants. This procedure was chosen due to the highly correlated
nature of the features, and the larger number of features (n =
53) than observations (n = 38). In order to reduce overfitting of

the explanatory model, the lambda value for regularization was
chosen through a randomized tenfold cross-validation procedure
as the minimum cross-validated mean squared error (MSE) that
provided a nonnull model. The outcome measure for each model
was log transformed to ensure a more normal distribution. The

GREENE et al.: ASSESSMENT AND CLASSIFICATION OF EARLY-STAGE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS WITH INERTIAL SENSORS

α value for the elastic net procedure was set to 0.5 prior to
analysis. The model fit provided by the elastic net procedure is
quantified using MSE and degrees of freedom (DoF). The coefficient of determination (R2 ) was also calculated for the dataset
when applied to the model estimates produced. All analysis was
performed offline in MATLAB version 7.11 (Natick, VA, USA).
3) Classification Analysis: As data were not normally distributed, a nonparametric hypothesis test (Wilcoxon rank-sum
test) was used to determine if there were significant (p < 0.05)
differences between the clinical variables, common to the MS
and control cohorts (differences are indicated in Table I).
A logistic regression model was used to classify patients as
“MS” (n = 38) or “Control” (n = 33). Features were selected
using a cross-validated sequential forward feature selection routine [20]. Generalized classifier performance estimates were
obtained through ten randomized repetitions of tenfold cross
validation. Using the variables listed in Table II, feature selection was carried out in the innermost (nested) cross-validation
loop to ensure an unbiased estimate of the classifier’s performance on unseen data. The “outer” loop used leave-one-out
cross validation to test the selected model and features, using
data independent of the training phase.
Classification accuracy is defined as the percentage of study
participants correctly classified as either “MS” or “Control.”
Sensitivity was defined as the percentage of MS patients correctly classified as “MS.” Similarly, specificity was defined
as the percentage of control subjects correctly classified as
“Control” subjects.

OF MSIS-20 AND EDSS

A. Inertial Sensor Parameter Reliability
The intrasession reliability of the inertial sensor parameters
derived from participants performing three consecutive TUG
tests was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients
(ICC(2, k)).
Per the reliability levels suggested by Shrout and Fleiss [18],
36 of 53 mobility parameters demonstrated excellent reliability
(ICC ࣙ 0.7), while nine of 53 parameters demonstrated moderate reliability (ICC ࣙ 0.4). Seven parameters exhibited poor
reliability (ICC < 0.4). The parameters exhibiting poor reliability were those based on gait variability or turn parameters,
suggesting patients employed different turn strategies between
iterations as well as more variable gait patterns.
For the control data, 42 of 53 parameters demonstrated goodto-excellent reliability, nine demonstrated moderate reliability,
while two demonstrated poor reliability.
B. Exploratory Analysis of MS Disease State
Using cross validation, an elastic net regularized regression
model for MSIS-20 yielded an MSE of 1.1 with 10 DoF. The
value of λ was chosen through tenfold cross validation [see
Fig. 2(a)]. When all data were applied to the model generated
through the elastic net procedure, the coefficient of determination R2 was 0.7 with a root MSE of 7.3 [see Fig. 3(a)].

Similarly, an elastic net regularized regression model for

V. DISCUSSION
This study sought to investigate the utility of inertial sensors
for assessing patients with early-stage relapsing remitting MS,
as measured using the EDSS and MSIS-20 scales. The intrasession reliability of manually timed and inertial sensor mobility
parameters from three consecutive TUG tests for each participant was examined using ICCs and compared against those
obtained from healthy controls. In order to obtain this measure of reliability, each participant completed three TUG tests.
While participants were given an opportunity to rest between
trials. The reliability of parameters obtained from MS patients
was found to compare favorably in terms of reliability to those
obtained from controls. However, there was a tendency toward
lower reliability in MS patients for some parameters (e.g., mean
stride velocity, turning time), though the reverse was also true
(time to first step). This discrepancy might indicate declining
performance in the MS patients due to fatigue. In order to obtain a measure of the reliability of the inertial sensors parameters
during the TUG in this population, each participant completed
three TUG tests. Although participants were given an opportunity to rest between trials, the fragile nature of this population
suggests fatigue across trials may have affected the reliability
data when compared to controls.
A preliminary version of this study [21] has been reported
elsewhere but is expanded here with a larger dataset. More
details on the explanatory models of disease state have been
added as well as a comparison against control subjects and
classification analysis. Furthermore, this is the first attempt to
classify patients as “MS” or “Control,” as well as attempting to
determine associations between MS disease state and inertial
sensor parameters.
The intrasession reliability of manually timed and inertial sensor parameters obtained during TUG have been reported elsewhere [22]. However, to our knowledge, this is the first attempt
to quantify the reliability of gait and turning parameters in patients with RR MS using inertial sensors. The parameters used in
this study were derived from triaxial inertial sensors attached to

both shanks, where difficulties related to sensor orientation were
minimal. The spatial temporal gait parameters and angular velocity parameters demonstrate overall high levels of reliability,
although some gait variability measures showed poor reliability
suggesting high variability between trials. Salarian et al. [10]
investigated the turn in their study and demonstrated good to
excellent intrasession reliability, whereas certain turn variables
in this study yielded much lower ICCs, e.g., turn magnitude,
turning time.
Explanatory regression models of the EDSS and MSIS-20
scores were derived from the inertial sensor parameters using
the elastic net regularization procedure. This automated analysis found that certain parameters were associated with disease
state in MS and regression models based on these parameters
might be used to generate explanatory models of disease state.
Parameters based on angular velocity and angular velocity ×
height (associated with foot speed and minimum ground clearance [23]) were associated with EDSS, while the MSIS-20 score
was associated with more standard gait measures such as number of steps and cadence as well as well as angular velocity
parameters.
Logistic regression classifier models were used to in classify
participants as either MS patients or control subjects based on
their mobility parameters while completing the TUG test. Excellent results were achieved (classification accuracy of 96.90%)
suggesting the potential utility of this method in screening for
early-stage MS.
A limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size
and the fact that the control population were not age and gender matched. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed that there were
significant differences in age (p < 0.05). To account for this,
all analysis controlled for age as well as height and weight.
Furthermore, the present results do not offer any insight into
how the present method would perform in distinguishing gait
patterns in other neurological conditions. Mobility parameters
obtained during the TUG test, in particular those calculating the
coefficient of variation, should not be compared against gait parameters obtained from steady-state walking trials and instead
should be looked as measures of variability over the course of
a TUG test. It should also be noted as an additional limitation
that gait symmetry measures were not considered independently
of the gait variability measures. Furthermore, in this study,
we focused on the gait and turning portions of the TUG test,
the overall time to complete (TUG test time), as well as the
time to first step and time from last step to end of recording are
also included, but are calculated using a combination of manual
and automatically derived measures. Manually timed recordings
could be considered less objective than automatic recordings.
This should also be considered as a limitation of the study.
The MS patient cohort had a mean EDSS score of 1.25,
indicating that all patients were at relatively early stages in their
disease progression. No patients were on DMT and so their gait
and mobility cannot be considered to have been affected by
medication.
Results suggest that quantitative assessment of mobility using
inertial sensors may have a role in characterizing mobility in
early-stage MS and may have a role in explaining disease state

GREENE et al.: ASSESSMENT AND CLASSIFICATION OF EARLY-STAGE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS WITH INERTIAL SENSORS

in MS patients. We have demonstrated that a combination of
manually timed and automatically derived mobility parameters
from a TUG test, instrumented on the lower limbs with inertial
sensors are associated with MS disease state as measured by
the MSIS-20 and EDSS scores. We have also demonstrated that
it may be possible to classify patients as early-stage “MS” or
“Control” based on parameters derived from inertial sensors and
manual timings.
Future work will examine longitudinal assessment of MS patients, monitoring response to DMT. We would also hope to
confirm the reported associations between inertial sensor parameters and disease state through replication in a larger trial.
Changes in the quantitative parameters obtained from the sensor data during a mobility assessment could be used to determine response to medication or mapped to clinical changes
observed from application of the EDSS and MSIS-20 scales.
Similarly, a cognitive function could be assessed using SDMT
or MoCA scales, with decline in the cognitive function measured by changes in these clinical scales. These changes could
be used to determine if the instrumented mobility assessment
can be used to quantify MS disease state and disease progression. In addition, automatic identification of postural transitions
using a sensor on the torso, to characterize trunk rotation, as well
as gait asymmetry, may add additional discriminatory power for
distinguishing MS patients from controls.
We have found that manually timed and inertial sensor mobility parameters obtained during the TUG test are reliable for
assessment of patients with MS. Furthermore, we examined the
relationship between the mobility parameters and MS disease
state in patient with early-stage MS. We also found that combined inertial sensor and manually timed mobility parameters
may be used to distinguish between patients with early-stage
MS and controls.
