The Effects of Cell Asynchrony on Gene Expression
Levels: Analysis and Application
to Plasmodium Falciparum
Wei Zhao, Student Member, IEEE, Justin Dauwels, Senior Member, IEEE, and Jianshu Cao

Abstract‚ÄîTo investigate the intraerythrocytic developmental
cycle of Plasmodium falciparum, time-series gene expression data
is commonly measured of infected red blood cells. However, the
observed data are usually blurred due to cell asynchrony during
experiments. In this paper, the effect of cell asynchrony is investigated by conducting numerical experiments. The simulation results
suggest that cell asynchrony has varying effects on different intrinsic expression patterns. Specifically, the intrinsic patterns with high
expression around the late life stage are more likely to be affected
by cell asynchrony. It is also investigated how the effect of cell
asynchrony depends on the experimental conditions. From this
analysis, the burst rate r% in infection period and the standard
deviation œÉ of growth rate are identified to have a strong impact on
the blurring due to cell asynchrony. Consequently, it is important
to measure these two parameters during biological experiments in
order to deblur time-series gene expression data.

I. INTRODUCTION
PPROXIMATELY 207 million people are infected by
malaria, and in 2012, about 627 000 people died from
this disease [1]. Malaria is transmitted when female Anopheles
mosquitoes bite humans, and inject sporozoites that invade the
liver, resulting in the production of merozoites. These merozoites are released into the blood, invading red blood cells
(RBCs). The infected red blood cells (iRBCs) undergo an intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) that is characterized
by three stages, namely: rings, trophozoites, and schizonts [2].
Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) is the most fatal Plasmodium species which causes human malaria. In many efforts
to understand the blood stages of the P. falciparum infection,
time-series gene expression data are measured over the 48-h
IDC [2]‚Äì[5]. To better investigate the underlying mechanisms,
the parasites are required to be at equivalent stages while the
gene expression data are being measured. Therefore, sorbitol
treatments are usually conducted to obtain iRBCs synchronized

at the schizont stage [6], [7]. Once these schizonts burst, merozoites are released, which further invade fresh RBCs. Therefore,
a complete IDC can be observed from the newly infected RBCs
over the next 48 h.
However, a perfect synchronization is difficult to achieve.
Although the experiment is initialized with synchronized schizonts, the parasite cultures gradually lose synchrony. Consequently, the intrinsic gene expression patterns remain blurred
in the observed gene expression data. In our earlier work, we
developed a linear system to model the superposition across
cells over the IDC [8]. In particular, the decay of cell synchrony
is described as a cell age distribution which changes over the
course of the experiment. The cell age distributions at different
time points constitute the observation matrix of the linear system. The cell asynchrony in other cells has been studied earlier,
such as yeast [9] and Caulobacter crescentus [10]. The decay
of cell synchrony strongly depends on the type of cell and the
treatments conducted on them to enhance the cell synchrony.
Therefore, dedicated effort is required to model the asynchrony
of different cell types. We model the cell asynchrony of P. falciparum over a 48-h IDC. To the best of our knowledge, no such
models have been proposed before for P. falciparum.
This paper is an extended version of an earlier conference
paper [11]. Additional figures, results, and discussions are included in this journal version. In this paper, we analyze the
linear model proposed in [8] to better understand the effects of
cell asynchrony. There are two questions that we are specifically
interested in:
1) Are there specific shapes of intrinsic expression patterns
that are more likely to be affected by cell asynchrony?
2) How do the effects of cell asynchrony on gene expression
levels depend on the experimental conditions?
We conduct simulations on synthetic intrinsic gene expression patterns to answer these two questions. We investigate the effect of cell asynchrony by assessing the difference between the intrinsic patterns and the observed expression data. From this analysis, we observe that cell asynchrony
depends on the shape of intrinsic expression patterns. Specifically, intrinsic patterns with high expression around the late
life stage are more likely to be affected. We also model different experimental conditions by changing the values of the
parameters in the linear system. We observe that the burst rate
r% during infection period, and the standard deviation œÉ of
the growth rate, have a strong effect on cell asynchrony. This
observation also highlights the importance of estimating the parameters r% and œÉ in order to deblur the observed time-series

data. With better estimates of the parameters that have a strong
effect on cell asynchrony, more accurate intrinsic gene expression patterns may be reconstructed [8].
In Section II, we review our linear model of cell asynchrony.
In Section III, we analyze the effect of different parameters,
within that model, on cell asynchrony, and in Section IV, we
discuss our results. In Section V, we discuss how the parameters
can be manipulated in experimental settings. Conclusions are
drawn at the end of the paper.
II. MODEL
Here we briefly review the model for cell asynchrony proposed in our earlier work [8]. This forms a guide to the rest of
this paper.
Although the IDC of P. falciparum lasts for about 48 h, it
slightly varies between different strains. For example, three microarray experiments were respectively conducted over 48, 50
and 53 h, respectively, to cover the IDC of three different P.
falciparum strains [4]. Therefore, the length of IDC is assumed
to be a variable L in our model. For simplification, the value of
L will be set to 48 in our numerical experiments.
Gene expression levels are measured at discrete time points
over L-hour IDC. The resulting observed expression data ei (t)
at time point t can be modeled as an integral over one life span
of iRBCs

where {N (t, 1), N (t, 2), . . . , N (t, L)}) denotes the cell

pattern of a specific gene i; the latter is a virtual expression
pattern measured from a perfectly-synchronized cell population
over the exact L-hour life span. From (2), a linear system can
be derived to model the relationship between intrinsic pattern

Fig. 2. Each of the functions S(t), R(t), and R f (t) corresponds to one of the three generations of iRBCs appearing in the experiment. These functions are
respectively described by the following key parameters: the burst rate in the infection period r%, the infection factors {a in , a af }, and the standard deviation of the
growth rate œÉ. The first data point is assumed to be at t = 1, and therefore, the infection period is the time range {t| ‚àí 1 < t < 1}.

for the late-stage iRBCs which are used to infect fresh RBCs
to initialize the experiment. The fresh RBCs infected at the
beginning of the experiment constitute the second generation.
Due to the diversity of growth rates, a few fast-growing iRBCs of
the second generation will burst and infect additional RBCs. As
a result, the third generation of iRBCs appears at the end of the
experiment. The three integrals that appear in (4) correspond
to the three generations of iRBCs. Specifically, S(t) denotes
the number of first generation iRBCs that have burst at time t;
R(t) stands for the number of second generation iRBCs infected
at time t; Rf (t) denotes the number of third generation iRBCs
infected at time t. These three functions are essential to calculate
the observation matrix N (t, re ), which describes the cell age
distribution of the three generations iRBCs over the L-hour IDC
as shown in Fig. 1(b). In the remainder of this section, we review
the key parameters involved in describing S(t), R(t), and Rf (t).
A. Burst Rate in Infection Period
The number of first generation iRBCs which burst at time t is
denoted as S(t). We derive the expression of S(t) based on the
percentage of first generation iRBCs which burst in the two-hour
infection period. According to the experimental specifications
[8], r% of the first generation iRBCs burst in the two-hour
infection period prior to the experiment. The remaining 1 ‚àí r%
iRBCs remain alive and continually infect fresh RBCs till around
h hours after the two-hour infection period. Therefore, S(t) is
approximated as a piecewise function

The number of second generation iRBCs infected at time t is
denoted as R(t). Since the second generation iRBCs are infected
by first generation iRBCs, R(t) is proportional to the number
of first generation iRBCs that burst at time t

respectively. Since the cell concentration is reduced by diluting
the culture after the infection period [2], [4], the value of aaf is
expected to be smaller than ain .

Overall, the three functions S(t), R(t), and Rf (t) are described by four key parameters {r%, ain , aaf , œÉ}, as shown in
Fig. 2. The elements of the observation matrix N (t, re ) can be
calculated by substituting the expressions of S(t), R(t), and
Rf (t) into (4).

pattern fi (re ) into the linear system denoted by N (t, re ). The difference between intrinsic pattern and observed data D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) is calculated to measure the effects
of cell asynchrony.

III. ANALYSIS
In this section, we conduct simulations on synthetic intrinsic
gene expression patterns. The observed expression pattern b is
obtained by substituting the intrinsic pattern fi (re ) into the linear system (3). The difference between the observed pattern b
and intrinsic pattern fi (re ) is calculated to investigate the effects of cell asynchrony. As discussed in the previous section,
the linear system is dominated by three groups of parameters:
the burst rate r% in the infection period, the infection factors
{ain , aaf }, and the standard deviation œÉ of the growth rate. We
also consider different values within the parameters of the linear
system {r%, ain , aaf , œÉ} to model different experimental conditions.
A. Synthetic Gene Expression Patterns
A ‚Äújust-in-time‚Äù principle has been proposed to describe the
gene expression of P. falciparum within the 48-h IDC [2], [12].
The transcript level of a gene involved in the key biological
processes of IDC is expected to peak, just before the encoded
protein is needed. Therefore, synthetic gene expression patterns
fi (re ) are generated by utilizing the bell curve of a normal
distribution. Each of them simulates a synthetic gene with high
expression level at different stages in its life span. The mean ŒºÃÇ
and standard deviation œÉÃÇ of a normal distribution correspond to
the position of the peak and width of the bell curve.
The gene expression patterns fi (re ) present the change of
gene expression levels over one life span. Once the iRBCs reach
the end of their life span, they will burst and start the next life
cycle. Hence, the expression level at the first data point fi (1) is

highly correlated with the expression level at the last data point
fi (L). Therefore, we simply assume that fi (re ) has the same
value at re = 1 and re = L. The synthetic gene expression
patterns are generated as follows:

B. Effects of Cell Asynchrony
We assess the difference between the synthetic intrinsic pattern fi (re )|ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ and observed expression data ei (t) by a measure
D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) defined as follows:

Since only the trend of the expression data is of interest here,
the values of fi (re )|ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ and ei (t) are normalized across the cell
life span. The observed expression data ei (t) are measured at
discrete data points. By substituting (3) into (11), the expression
of D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) can be written in discrete form as

chosen to model the experimental conditions, following which

the linear system is generated from these parameters. Specifically, the elements of the observation matrix A of the linear
system are calculated according to (4). Second, the bell-curved
synthetic intrinsic patterns fi (re )|ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ are generated with values
{ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ}, which respectively denote the position and the shape
of the bell curve respectively. Third, the observed patterns are
obtained by substituting the intrinsic pattern fi (re )|ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ into the
linear system. The effect of cell asynchrony is measured as the
difference between the observed pattern and intrinsic pattern
according to (12). The details of the experiments are described
in Algorithm 1. The experimental results will be discussed in
next section.

A. Effects on Different Expression Patterns
Algorithm 1 is executed to calculate the measure D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ)
for different synthetic intrinsic patterns fi (re )|ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ . The
values of the parameters {r%, ain , aaf , œÉ} are fixed as
{36%, 7.11, 1.82, 0.1}, estimated from experimental specifications in our earlier study [8]. The synthetic intrinsic patterns
fi (re )|ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ are generated with values of {ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ} in the range
of {ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ|4 < ŒºÃÇ < 44, 0.5 < œÉÃÇ < 5}. The difference D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) is
calculated between each synthetic intrinsic pattern x and its
corresponding observed pattern b, according to (12).
To have a better understanding, we interpret a row and column
vector of the 2-D plot of D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) separately, as depicted in Fig. 4.
The parameters {ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ} denote the position and the shape of the
bell curve used, respectively, to generate the synthetic intrinsic
pattern fi (re )|ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ , as demonstrated in Fig. 4(a) and (c).

but with a fixed shape (œÉÃÇ = 1). As shown in Fig. 4(b), the row

(smaller value of œÉÃÇ) around the late life stages (larger value
of ŒºÃÇ) are more likely to be affected by cell asynchrony [8]. In
the next section, we will further investigate how the effects of
cell asynchrony depend on the parameters {r%, ain , aaf , œÉ}, and
hence the experimental conditions.
B. Effects Under Various Experimental Conditions

Fig. 5. Average value of D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) which is obtained by executing Algorithm
1 one thousand times with the randomly selected values of {r%, a in , a af , œÉ}.

vector {D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ)|4 < ŒºÃÇ < 44, œÉÃÇ = 1} decreases when the value
of ŒºÃÇ changes from 4 to 10, after which the trend reverses after ŒºÃÇ
further increases toward 44. The highest value of the row vector
{D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ)|4 < ŒºÃÇ < 44, œÉÃÇ = 1} is obtained around ŒºÃÇ = 40. The
pattern of this row vector suggests that cell asynchrony has the
strongest effect on the intrinsic patterns fi (re )|ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ when the
expression level peaks at a late stage in the life cycle, and is
substantially weaker at the early stages of the life cycle. This
is a common observation for all row vectors in the 2-D plot of
D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) [see Fig. 4(e)].
Similarly, the column vector {D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ)|ŒºÃÇ = 30, 0.5 < œÉÃÇ <
5} shows how D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) varies with intrinsic patterns fi (re )|ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ
with a fixed position of the peak ŒºÃÇ = 30 but with varying shape
(0.5 < œÉÃÇ < 5). As shown in Fig. 4(d), values in the column
vector {D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ)|ŒºÃÇ = 30, 0.5 < œÉÃÇ < 5} continuously decrease
when œÉÃÇ changes from 0.5 to 5. This suggests that the cell asynchrony has a continuously decreasing effect on intrinsic patterns fi (re )|ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ , if its bell-shaped expression curve becomes
more dispersed. This is also the common conclusion that can be
drawn from all column vectors of the D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ).
As discussed earlier on in this paper, the experimental conditions are described by four parameters: the burst rate in infection
period r%, the infection factors {ain , aaf }, and the standard deviation of growth rate œÉ. Although their values were estimated
as {36%, 7.11, 1.82, 0.1} from the experimental specifications
[8], these values can vary across different runs of experiments
due to unavoidable uncertainty and variability in experimental
conditions. Therefore, to observe the effects of cell asynchrony
in a more realistic scenario, more simulations are conducted
where the values of {r%, ain , aaf , œÉ} are generated by multiplying {36%, 7.11, 1.82, 0.1} with a random sample from the
normal distribution N (1, 0.32 ). Specifically, Algorithm 1 is executed one thousand times with randomly selected values of
{r%, ain , aaf , œÉ}. Similar patterns can be observed in the average value of D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) (see Fig. 5) as in the deterministic case
discussed earlier in Fig. 4.
To summarize, the 2-D plots of D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) presented in Figs. 4
and 5 suggest that intrinsic patterns with high expression

In this section, we calculate D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) with different parameters
{r%, ain , aaf , œÉ} to simulate how the effects of cell asynchrony
depends on experimental conditions.
The parameters are first initialized as {36, 7.11, 1.82, 0.1},
the estimated values from our earlier study [8]. Then, one of the
four parameters is selected and changed to either half or twice
of its initial value, to simulate different experimental conditions.
For example, Fig. 6(a) and (b) shows D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) with parameter
r% changed to 18 and 72, respectively. By comparing these two
figures, we can observe how the difference D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) is influenced
by the value of r%. When the parameter r% decreases from 72
to 18, D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) increases considerably on all intrinsic patterns
fi (re )|ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ . The same phenomenon is also observed when the
parameter œÉ increases from 0.05 to 0.2, as shown in Fig. 6(g)
and (h), respectively. By contrast, as illustrated in Fig. 6(c) and
(d), D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) only increases slightly when ain decreases from
14.22 to 3.56, respectively. Similarly, from Fig. 6(e) and (h), it
can be seen that D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) does not vary much when aaf increases
from 0.91 to 3.64 except for small values of ŒºÃÇ.
From this analysis, it becomes clear that the parameters r%
and œÉ have a strong effect on cell asynchrony, whereas the parameters ain and aaf have far lesser influence on cell asynchrony.
Therefore, when measuring expression levels experimentally, it
is crucial to properly measure parameters r% and œÉ, either directly or indirectly.
V. DISCUSSIONS
Here, we discuss how the parameters {r%, ain , aaf , œÉ} can be
manipulated in experimental settings.
Sorbitol treatments are typically conducted in experiments to
synchronize the iRBCs at the schizont stage [2]. These schizonts
infect fresh RBCs and initialize the experiment. As mentioned
earlier on in this paper, r% of schizonts burst in the infection period, followed by the remaining 1 ‚àí r% of schizonts which burst
after the infection period. Therefore, the burst rate r% in the infection period is highly correlated with the degree of synchrony
of schizonts. In addition to the standard sorbitol treatments, new
protocols which combine Percoll and sorbitol treatments have
been proposed to achieve tight synchronization of P. falciparum
[13]. Therefore, higher values of r% can be achieved if a more
homogeneous population of schizonts is used to initialize the
experiment.
The infection factors ain and aaf respectively denote the average number of RBCs that can be infected by one schizont
during and after the infection period, respectively. One schizont
usually contains 12 to 16 merozoites, which can further infect
RBCs [14]. As mentioned earlier in the model section, cell culture is diluted to reduce the concentration of RBCs in order
to avoid further infection after the infection period. Hence, aaf

Fig. 6. 2-D plots of D(ŒºÃÇ, œÉÃÇ) calculated with different parameters {r%, a in , a af , œÉ}. The value of r% is 18 in (a) and 72 in (b), and 36 in the other figures.
Similarly, a in is equal to 3.56 in (c) and 14.22 in (d), and 7.11 in the other figures; a af is equal to 0.91 in (e) and 3.64 in (f), and 1.82 in the other figures; œÉ is
equal to 0.05 (g) and 0.2 (h), and 0.1 in the other figures.

is smaller than ain . This suggests that the infection factors ain
and aaf are proportional to the concentration of RBCs. Therefore, they can be manipulated by changing the concentration of
RBCs accordingly.
The standard deviation œÉ of the normalized life span indicates
the diversity of growth rate between individual iRBCs. So far,
no experimental technique has been shown to manipulate the
value of œÉ.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated the effects of cell asynchrony
on time-series gene expression data of P. falciparum by conducting numerical experiments. By analyzing a linear model
of cell asynchrony, we demonstrated how cell asynchrony has
varying effects on different intrinsic expression patterns, and
how these effects are influenced by the experimental conditions
(model parameters). The presented analysis may help to gain a
better understanding of the effects of cell asynchrony on expression data, and underlines the importance of measuring certain
variables, i.e., the burst rate r% in the infection period, and the
standard deviation œÉ of the growth rate, during experimental
measurements of expression levels.
