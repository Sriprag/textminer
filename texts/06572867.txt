Abstract—The impact of calcification on the carotid atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability remains controversial and unclear. This
study assesses the critical mechanical conditions induced by the calcium at the lumen surface, i.e., juxtaluminal calcification (JLCa),
within human carotid atherosclerotic plaque. Eleven patients with
evidence of JLCa were included for the analysis. The plaque geometry was reconstructed based on computed tomography and magnetic resonance images and 3-D fluid-structure interaction simulation was used for mechanical analysis. The presence of JLCa
increased local stresses compared to when calcification was artificially covered with a 0.2-mm-thick fibrous cap (107.87 kPa [76.99,
129.14] versus 63.17 kPa [34.55, 75.13]; Median, [interquartile
range]; p < 0.0001). Stretch ratio decreased from 1.18 [1.07, 1.27]
to 1.13 [1.10, 1.18] (p = 0.03). The presence of JLCa significantly
elevates local stress and stretch level. Further exploration of this
plaque feature is warranted as a possible risk factor causing plaque
vulnerability.

I. INTRODUCTION
OST studies investigating carotid plaque morphology
focus on three plaque components namely fibrous cap
(FC), lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC), and plaque hemorrhage
(PH). It is the extent of these components within a plaque, which

dictates if a plaque is stable or vulnerable; with stable plaques
having a thick FC and small lipid pool compared to a thin FC and
large lipid pool with or without hemorrhage in unstable plaques.
Calcification within the plaque is often overlooked. In a recent
systematic review of 24 studies, it has been reported that clinically symptomatic carotid plaques have less calcium content
than asymptomatic ones [1]. Of interest was this recent report
that carotid plaques not so rich in calcium had higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines [2]. These findings support
earlier observations that calcium may have a plaque stabilizing
role [3], [4]. But whether large overall calcium content in a
carotid plaque makes it vulnerable or not remains inconclusive.
Using an idealized 2-D model, we have reported that it is the location of calcium deposit within a plaque, which determines the
extent to which biomechanical stresses are influenced [5]; the
more superficial the calcium, the higher are associated structural
stresses. Results of a recent magnetic resonance (MR) study
show higher prevalence of PH with superficial calcification [6].
In this study, we assess how the presence of juxtaluminal calcium (JLCa) affects the critical mechanical conditions within
carotid plaques.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
In this study, 11 consecutive patients who had undergone
both computerized tomography (CT) and MR imaging of their
carotid arteries and had evidence of JLCa were included. The
imaging protocol has been approved by local ethics committee
(05/Q0108/441 and 03/176).
A. Imaging Protocols and Analysis
The MR protocol has been used previously by our group
for carotid plaque imaging [7]–[9]: Electrocardiograph-gated
fast spin echo pulse sequences with fat saturation were used to
delineate various plaque components: T1 -weighted (repetition
time/echo time: 1∗ RR/7.8 ms); proton density (PD)-weighted
(repetition time/echo time: 2∗ RR/7.8 ms); T2 -weighted (repetition time/echo time: 2∗ RR/85 ms); and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) (repetition time/echo time/inversion time:
2∗ RR/42 ms/150 ms); The field of view was 100 mm × 100 mm,
matrix size 256 × 256, and therefore, the in-plane resolution was
0.39 mm × 0.39 mm.
The CT protocol has also been described [10]. In brief, the
multidetector CT angiography acquisition was performed either on a 16- or 64-section multidetector CT scanner (Siemens

Somatom Sensation 16 or 64, Siemens Medical Solutions,
Erlangen, Germany). Scanning started after a 25-s delay following nonionic contrast administration of Iopamidol (Niopam
300; Bracco Diagnostics, Rome, Italy). The angiographic acquisition started from the aortic arch to the circle-of-Willis. CT
parameters settings included: tube voltage 120 kV; tube current 220–256 mA; rotation time 0.33 s (64 section) or 0.5 s
(16 section); 0.6/0.8-mm slice thickness with 0.3/0.4-mm increment; matrix 512 × 512; field of view 19–21 cm; and in-plane
resolution was 0.37 × 0.37–0.41 × 0.41 mm2 .
The coregistration of CT and MR images (see Fig. 1) was
referred to the carotid bifurcation considering the slice thickness (The slice thickness of MRI was 3 mm and 0.6–0.8 mm for
CT), the luminal shape and location of calcium nodules. Plaque
atherosclerotic components, including FC, LRNC, and PH, were
manually segmented using CMRTools (London, U.K.). Due to
the extremely short T2 , calcium is difficult to detect by traditional 2-D Turbo MR sequences. CT-angiography provides an
excellent compensation for the identification of calcium, and for
the confirmation of its presence on MR images. As shown in
Fig. 1(a) and (b), calcium has high signal intensity in CT and
hypointense in MR images. The presence of calcium within a
plaque was grouped in two categories: intraplaque—if calcification was present deep within the plaque and JLCa—if calcium
was in contact with bloodstream with no overlying component.
It was made according to the location and extension of calcium
using CT images [see Fig. 1(a)], the shape and smoothness of
the lumen surface in MR images [see Fig. 1(b)]. The histological validation was lacking due to the unavailability of plaque
sample as patients were not scheduled for surgery. The exis-

tence of JLCa was confirmed in ex vivo samples (see Fig. 2) in
a separated study.
B. 3-D Fluid-Structure Interaction Simulation
In vivo, an artery is axially stretched and pressurized, thus
preshrinking was applied to generate the start shape for the
computational simulation [11]. Stenotic vessels show an axial
prestretch with average value of 1.044 [12], [13]. In this study,
for simplicity, the axial stretch was set to be 5% for each patient. Circumferential shrinkage for lumen and outer wall was

TENG et al.: HOW DOES JUXTALUMINAL CALCIUM AFFECT CRITICAL MECHANICAL CONDITIONS

determined so that: 1) total mass volume was conserved and
2) plaque geometry after 5% axial stretch and pressurization
had the best match with the original in vivo geometry. Advanced plaques have complex irregular geometries with component inclusions that are challenging for mesh generation. A
component-fitting mesh generation technique was, therefore,
used to generate mesh. In brief, the 3-D plaque domain was
divided into hundreds of small “volumes” to curve-fit the irregular plaque geometry with plaque component inclusions. By
employing this technique, both structure and fluid domains can
be meshed using hexahedron elements.
Both the arterial wall and plaque components were assumed
to be hyperelastic, isotropic, incompressible, and piecewise homogeneous. The modified Mooney–Rivlin model was used to
describe the material property of each component in the plaque
W = c1 (I1 − 3) + D1 [exp (D2 (I1 − 3)) − 1]
where I1 is the first stretch invariant and c1 , D1 , and D2 are
material parameters derived from the previous experimental
work [14], [15]: vessel material, c1 = 36.8 kPa, D1 = 14.4 kPa,
D2 = 2; FC, c1 = 73.6 kPa, D1 = 28.8 kPa, D2 = 2.5; lipid
core, c1 = 2 kPa, D1 = 2 kPa, D2 = 1.5; calcification, c1 =
368 kPa, D1 = 144 kPa, D2 = 2.0. The material properties
of hemorrhage were derived from experiments done by Rubin
et al. [16]–[19]. For the fresh hemorrhage, the following parameters were used: c1 = 1 kPa, D1 = 1 kPa, D2 = 0.25; and recent
and old hemorrhage, the parameters were used: c1 = 9 kPa, D1
= 9 kPa, D2 = 0.25.
Blood flow was assumed to be laminar, Newtonian, viscous,
and incompressible. Incompressible Navier–Stokes equations
with arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation were used as
the governing equations

+ [((u − ug ) · ∇) u] = −∂p + μ∂ 2 u, ∇ · u = 0

with loading conditions
p|inlet = pin (t) ,

p|outlet = pout (t)

where u is the flow velocity, ug is the mesh velocity, p is the
pressure, and μ and ρb stand for the blood viscosity and density,
respectively. The motion of arterial wall was governed by,
ρw vi,tt = σij,j , i, j = 1, 2, 3; sum over j
with boundary condition
σij,j · nj |outer wall = 0
in which v is the displacement vector, σ is the stress tensor,
and t denotes time. No-slip condition between the flow-vessel
interfaces was set

where Γ represents the inner wall of the vessel and the superscripts, f and s, stand for fluid part and solid part, respectively. The full coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models
were solved in ADINA 8.6.1 (ADINA R&D, Inc.). It uses unstructured finite-element methods for both fluid and solid models. Nonlinear incremental iterative procedures were used to
handle FSIs. The governing finite-element equations for both
solid and fluid models are solved by the Newton–Raphson iteration method. Details of the models and methods are given by
Bathe [20].
To compare the biomechanical impact of JLCa with the presence of an FC over the calcium (i.e., intraplaque calcification),
a thin layer (0.2 mm) of FC was artificially generated to cover
the calcium and the FSI simulation was performed. Maximum
principal stress and stretch (stress-P1 and stretch-P1 ) and their
variations during one cardiac cycle around calcification in the
structure were extracted. Local fluid shear stress over lumen
surface was also investigated.
C. Statistical Analysis
Data normality was assessed by the Shapiro–Wilk test. For
nonnormal data, the two-tailed Wilcoxon matched pairs test and
for normal data, two-tailed paired t-test were used. Significant
difference was assumed if p < 0.05.
III. RESULTS
Patient demographics are tabulated in Table I. For each of
these 11 carotid plaques, 1645 ± 486 small volumes were used to
curve-fit plaque structure, which was further meshed by 33975 ±
4759 hexahedron elements with 43704 ± 6250 nodes, and the
corresponding fluid domain was meshed by 22783 ± 6267 hexahedron elements with 28158 ± 12881 nodes.
The presence of JLCa increased Stress-P1 compared to when
calcium was artificially covered with a 0.2-mm-thick FC [107.87
[76.99, 129.14] versus 63.17 [34.55, 75.13]; Median, [interquartile range]; p < 0.0001; unit: kPa; see Fig. 3(a)]. As shown in
Fig. 4, after the JLCa was covered by a thin FC, the stress
concentration around the calcium disappeared and stress-P1
dropped from 146.66 to 93.81 kPa (36.04%). Stress-P1 variation
during one cardiac cycle changed from 32.32 [20.65, 48.84] to
22.99 [8.40, 25.59] [p = 0.0002; unit: kPa; see Fig. 3(b)]. Stretch
ratio decreased from 1.18 [1.07, 1.27] to 1.13 [1.10, 1.18] [p =
0.0384; see Fig. 3(c)] and its variation from 0.07 [0.01, 0.12] to
0.05 [0.02, 0.07] [p = 0.0569; see Fig. 3(d)], respectively. The
peak axial fluid shear stress did not change when the JLCa was
covered by a thin FC (31.60 [13.08, 55.88] versus 30.90 [13.21,
55.49]; p = 0.2312; unit: dyne/cm2 ). Although the minimum
axial fluid shear stress was significantly higher in the case of
JLCa (5.28 [0.87, 9.41] versus 5.22 [0.85, 9.19]; p = 0.0212;
unit: dyne/cm2 ), the percentage change was small (5.2 ± 9.2%).

had a very limited impact on the local fluid shear stress conditions. The appearance of high stress concentration around the
region with JLCa (mostly around the interface between calcium
and FC) might be due to the mismatch of material properties
between calcium and adjacent soft tissues as calcium is a much
stronger constituent [21]. If a layer of thin FC (0.2 mm in thickness) is used to cover the calcium artificially, high stress concentrations disappear. Further analysis indicates that the impact
of JLCa on elevating stress level is similar with the case of lipid
core with a thin FC. If the calcium was replaced by lipid and
covered by a layer of FC (0.2 mm), the local stress level changed
to be 102.36 kPa [75.19, 131.40], which was comparable with
the case of JLCa (p = 0.4965).
Previously, Vengrenyuk et al. had reported that microcalcifications within a thin FC would doubled plaque stresses [22].
Using idealized 3-D FSI, Bluestein et al. observed that the
vulnerable plaque with the embedded calcification spot presented higher wall stress concentration region in the FC a
bit upstream to the calcified spot, with stress propagating to
the deformable parts of the structure around the calcified spot
[23]. Similarly using 3-D FSI, Wenk et al. reported that the
circumferential stress in the fibrous tissue phase increased as
the volume fraction of microcalcifications was increased, and
that the stress exceeds a critical threshold when the FC thickness was decreased [24]. Opposing observations were however
reported by Huang et al. using 2-D large-strain finite-element
analysis of 20 postmortem specimens of human coronary lesions [25]. Maximum stress was not correlated with percentage
of calcification, but it was positively correlated with the percentage of lipid. Noteworthy is the point that all the aforementioned
studies are on coronary arteries. Recently, using an idealized 3-D
FSI carotid model, Wong demonstrated that increase of calcium
content that was coupled with a decrease in lipid core volume
could stabilize plaque structurally [26]. A general description of
calcium may, therefore, be insufficient. Its risk nature is possible
that depending upon on their location within a plaque, some calcification may act as a marker for a stable lesion, whereas other
forms might identify an unstable vascular environment [27].
The mechanism of the formation of JLCa is unclear. The initiation of calcification is suspected to require apoptosis of intralesional smooth muscle cells to generate apoptotic bodies that act
as nucleating foci of calcification [28], inflammation, lipoprotein, and phospholipid accumulation, and finally, hydroxyapatite
deposition. Other cells, such as macrophages and endothelial
cells are also involved in the process. Macrophages synthesize
and deposit proteins such as alkaline phosphatase and osteopontin, which act as a template for hydroxyapatite deposition [29].
Endothelial cells exert a vasoprotective effect against calcification by expressing matrix GLA protein, a potent vitamin-Kdependent inhibitor of vascular calcification [30]. Therefore, it
is very unlikely that calcium deposits passively onto the luminal surface which subsequently develops into JLCa. Possibly,
it is a result of erosion; that is, the thin FC initially covering
superficial calcium erodes away and the subluminal calcium is
exposed, which forms JLCa. That has been proposed as a risk
factor in coronary atherosclerotic diseases albeit an infrequent
cause of thrombotic occlusion [31]. JLCa may be a feature of

39

vulnerable plaques as calcified cerebral embolus, which was
suspected to be from surface calcification, was observed in a
patient suffering from stroke [32]. Further studies are needed to
assess the clinical significance of JLCa.
Despite the interesting finding obtained in this study, some
limitations exist: 1) the patient-specific material properties of
components were not used in this study, as they are not measurable with current imaging technique and 2) for the same
reason, the residual stress was not taken into account in our
simulations [33]–[35].
