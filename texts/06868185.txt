Abstract—Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) remains an empirical, yet highly effective, surgical
treatment for advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD). DBS outcome
depends on accurate stimulation of the STN sensorimotor area
which is a trial-and-error procedure taking place during and after
surgery. Pathologically enhanced beta-band (13–35 Hz) oscillatory
activity across the cortico-basal ganglia pathways is a prominent
neurophysiological phenomenon associated with PD. We hypothesized that weighing together beta-band frequency peaks from simultaneous microelectrode recordings in “off-state” PD patients
could map the individual neuroanatomical variability and serve
as a biomarker for the location of the STN sensorimotor neurons. We validated our hypothesis with 9 and 11 patients that,
respectively, responded well and poorly to bilateral DBS, after at
least two years of follow up. We categorized “good” and “poor”
DBS responders based on their clinical assessment alongside a
> 40% and <30% change, respectively, in “off” unified PD rating
scale motor scores. Good (poor) DBS responders had, in average, 1 mm (3.5 mm) vertical distance between the maximum betapeak weighted across the parallel microelectrodes and the center
of the stimulation area. The distances were statistically different
in the two groups (p = 0.0025). Our biomarker could provide
personalized intra- and postoperative support in stimulating the
STN sensorimotor area associated with optimal long-term clinical
benefits.

I. INTRODUCTION
LTHOUGH deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is being used in Parkinson’s disease
(PD) for two decades [1], the theoretical knowledge of the underlying therapeutic mechanisms is still surpassed by its clinical results [2]. STN-DBS provides consistent clinical benefits,
such as alleviation of Parkinsonian resting tremor, rigidity, and
bradykinesia [3], and reduces dopamine replacement requirements by 50% to 60% [4]. Its major pitfall though is that good
clinical results and adverse side effects mainly depend on the
accurate implantation of the stimulation electrode within the
sensorimotor area of the STN [5], [6].
During DBS implantation, the precise placement of the stimulation electrode is macroscopically guided by microelectrode
mapping of the neuronal activity at different subcortical depths
inside and outside the STN [7]. An expert neurologist monitors
microelectrode recordings (MERs) to identify the characteristic
spontaneous discharge pattern of the STN and of surrounding
nuclei as well as the locations of the movement-related STN
neurons [8]. The microelectrode trajectory that is selected for
stimulation is the one exhibiting movement-related activity or
the largest amount of STN-specific discharge pattern. Once the
trajectory is selected, a “trial-and-error” macrostimulation determines the therapeutic window for the selected STN area by
identifying the best clinical response without intraoperative side
effects [9].
The STN target identification through microelectrode mapping does not always secure a good clinical outcome [7], [10].
The intraoperative functional tests that are conducted while the
patient lies down on the operating table, during “off-state”, can
give only a gross estimation of the target location and, therefore, of the clinical improvement. What is more, the substantial
amelioration of PD symptoms such as dyskinesias as well as
sensory and cognitive side effects occur in the further postoperative course [5], [11]. Nonetheless, there is no functional
biomarker that can currently relate, during the operation, the
stimulated STN area with the long-term DBS outcome.
Recording the neuronal activity as close to its generator as
possible allows maxima spatial resolution and accuracy for a
MER-based localization of the STN. High frequency components of MERs (mainly the background noise and spike count)
have been used by several studies to detect the borders of the
STN [12]–[14]. The low frequency component of MERs, named
as local field potential (LFP), is also an information-rich signal.

MICHMIZOS et al.: BETA-BAND FREQUENCY PEAKS INSIDE THE SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS AS A BIOMARKER FOR MOTOR IMPROVEMENT

We have developed LFP-driven models that simulate the STN
spike activity [15]–[18] and the effects of DBS, at the neuronal
level [19]. LFPs have also been used for the localization of the
STN and of adjacent regions such as the zona incerta [20], [21].
The STN detection became even more prominent when the focal
nature of certain band activities in the STN-LFP was revealed.
The interrelationship between the emergence of oscillations and
synchrony among STN neurons in “off-state” PD patients [22],
[23] further spurred studies on the increased power and coherence in the alpha and beta frequency bands, in these patients
[24], [25]. Specifically for beta-band frequencies, accumulated
evidence suggests a persistent relation between good clinical response to STN-DBS and a significant attenuation in beta-band
LFP power, at rest [26], [27].
In an effort to detect intraoperatively the STN borders, several online algorithms fuse multiple features from a single MER.
For example, Zaidel et al. combine the background noise level
with spectrum estimation to detect the oscillatory dorsolateral
region (seemingly the preferred location for STN-DBS [28])
and nonoscillatory subterritories within the STN [14]. Recently,
Cagman et al. introduced an automated algorithm that combines
knowledge of background noise level, compound firing rate, and
power spectral density (PSD) along each trajectory to detect the
dorsal and the ventral borders of the STN [29]. These studies
rely on features acquired from a single microelectrode to distinguish the STN from the neighboring structures. However, due
to different disease states or presence of artifacts, changes in the
MER features specific to the STN can show significant variation. Importantly, the anatomical localization of the dorsolateral
region of the STN and its stimulation does not always provide a
positive therapeutic long-term response for STN-DBS [30]. To
overcome the pitfalls, one potential approach, which is proposed
in this study, is to combine the information about the individual
neuroanatomical variability from adjacent microelectrodes.
In this paper, we hypothesized that beta-frequency amplitude
peaks corresponded to the richest, in beta oscillations, motor
territories of the STN; we further hypothesized that the distance
between the stimulation and the STN sensorimotor areas determined the long-term clinical efficacy of DBS. Although such an
assumption remains to be neurophysiologically verified, herein
we propose a weighted sum of spontaneous beta-band peaks
across the MERs as a functional biomarker of DBS efficacy. We
validated our marker by comparing the proposed stimulation
locations with the clinical decisions of a human expert in 20 PD
patients (9 that responded well to therapy and 11 that did not),
with at least two years of follow up after the DBS implantation. We found that the distance between the beta-band marker
and the center of the stimulation area could predict the DBS
efficacy. Our results build support for using beta-band peaks to
inform the optimal localization of the stimulation points inside
the STN, during DBS implantation.
II. METHODS
A. MERs and DBS Implantation
The patients underwent surgery during “off” state according
to the CAPSIT-PD protocol [31] and gave informed consent

175

according to the procedure approved by the Ethics and Institutional Review Board committee of Evaggelismos Hospital,
Athens, Greece. We identified target coordinates after fusing
CT and intraoperative imaging with 3-D MRI images using
the Radionics Stereoplan workstation. The five microelectrode
trajectories were positioned in a cross (ben gun) formation
(central, anterior, posterior, lateral, and medial) and recordings
lasted for 10 s. The central electrode had a 2 mm distance
from any electrode in the periphery. The MERs typically initiated at 5 mm above the STN target and sampled the neuronal
activity across the electrode descent. They were obtained at
0.5 mm steps through the STN to the substantia nigra reticulata using the Leadpoint Neural Activity Monitoring System
(Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). For each electrode depth,
an expert neurologist (coauthor of this study, P.S.) identified
the characteristic STN discharge pattern and the movement related activity during voluntary or passive movements of the
patient. Intraoperative clinical assessment of the patient was performed during current stimulation (0.5–5.0 V, 60-μs pulse width,
130 Hz).
Upon the frame-based stereotactic localization of the target,
we implanted the Navigus (Image-guided Neurologics, Melbourne, FL) cranial base and the cap lead-anchoring device
over the burr hole and secured it with two self-tapping screws.
After carefully inserting the stimulation lead to the target, we
verified proper lead positioning with intraoperative fluoroscopy
(lateral skull X-rays). We then removed the stylet of the lead and
secured the distal shaft of the implanted lead into the Navigus
device. The pulse generator was connected to the distal end of
the implanted lead and secured into the implanted ferrule. After
closing the scalp wound in anatomical layers, we removed the
supportive head frame and, under general anesthesia, we placed
the pulse generator. On the third day after surgery, the patient
underwent postoperative MRI for further verification of the lead
position [32]. This procedure secured that only downward displacement of the stimulation lead could be present that could
not exceed 1.5 mm [9], [33].
Stimulation parameters (contact, pulse amplitude, width, and
frequency) were setup one week after surgery according to a
standard protocol [34] for optimal clinical benefit. The quadripolar stimulation electrodes (Medtronic leads) were stereotactically implanted into the STN of both sides. Contact-to-contact
distance was 0.5 mm whereas the contact itself had a diameter
of 1.5 mm. Stimulation was either monopolar or bipolar (i.e.,
two contacts with the same negative polarity).
B. Data Processing and Analysis
The MERs were acquired from spontaneous STN activity, defined as the neuronal activity acquired during periods in which
the PD patient lied down immobile on the operating table. No
electrical stimulation was applied during recordings. Neither
active nor passive movements were executed during the analyzed MERs. Only signals with STN activity present were
included in this study. Signals were visually inspected by an
expert neurologist (P. S) using the Leadpoint Export Utility
software (Medtronic), after the follow-up period of at least two

a cut-off frequency of 6 kHz, order of 900 and peak to
peak (p-p) rippling equal to 1.6 × 10−5 dB and then downsampled to 12 kHz for computational convenience. PSD estimation for each frequency, k, was done using the Welch’s

To assess normality of data, we reinforced our visual inspection of the distributions with the D’Agostino-Pearson’s omnibus K 2 test [37], under the null hypothesis that normality is a
reasonable assumption regarding the population distribution of
a random sample that was not skewed or suffered from kurtosis.
After confirming that the null hypothesis could not be rejected at
the significance level of 0.05, we employed the t-test to compare
the means between the grouped samples.
C. Postoperative Follow up of DBS Patients
Twenty patients were recruited for this study. They were
grouped into two categories, namely the “good” responders and
the “poor” responders. We categorized the patients after clinical
assessment in accordance with follow up studies in PD patients
[38], [39] that are based on standard neurological evaluations
pre- and post operatively, namely the unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale (UPDRS), the daily dose of anti-Parkinsonian
medication in levodopa equivalents and the Hoehn and Yahr
PD scale for disease progression [40] (Tables I and II). In addition to following a common clinical practice, our selection
of “poor” and “good” DBS responders was consistent with a
< 30% and >40% change in the “off-state” UPDRS after the
DBS surgery. The “off-state” UPDRS change has been used successfully in prior studies to discriminate between “good” and
“poor” responders [41], [42].
During the follow up, the neurologist had no access to the
information acquired from the MER data (beta-band peaks).
Hence, the final contact selection was clinical in nature. In
one patient with poor clinical outcome (P8), a second contact
([−5.0, −3.5]) was added to the first one ([−3.0, −1.5]) during
a follow-up visit, that patient also developed dysarthria. One
patient who was allocated to “good” responders (G9) improved

significantly in tremor and dyskinesia but not in rigidity and
walking ability and further developed a partially stimulationdependent dysarthrophonia.
D. Weighted Summation of Aggregate Normalized Beta Peak
as a Neurophysiological Biomarker
The estimation of the proposed biomarker for a given electrode depth is shown in Fig. 1(a). Upon defining the STN
borders, di ∈ [LBi , UBi ] mm where LBi and UBi are, respectively, the lower and upper STN boundaries for each microelectrode trajectory, i ∈ [1, . . . , 5], we estimated the power spectrum
for each depth, PSDdi , and normalized the beta-band peaks, βid
by the microelectrode impedance, Zi :
β̄id =

We then added the normalized same-depth beta peaks across

where WDi = 1/L is the weight related to the distance between the√adjacent microelectrodes and microelectrode i, and
L ∈ {2, 2 2, 4}mm corresponds to the Euclidean distance between the two microelectrodes (see Section II-A for interelectrode distance). For beta frequencies, this is in agreement with
current models of low-pass filtering of LFPs in brain tissue (see
[43, Figs. 4 and 10]). We then estimated our proposed marker,
m, as follows:
m = max(max(Wid )).

Fig. 2. Typical examples for poor (top) and good (bottom) responses to DBS
treatment. The marker is shown on the left of each plot. In poor response
(P2), there is a 5.75 mm distance between the maximum aggregate β-peak
marker, m, and the center of the stimulation area. Note the prominent β-peaks
observed in all four microelectrodes that were inside the STN at a 2 mm depth.
In good response (G5), the maximum aggregate β-peak marker fell inside the
stimulation area; other prominent β-peaks in Central and Posterior electrodes
were at −3 mm and −4 mm depths, respectively; both depths were inside the
stimulation area at depths between [−4, −2.5] mm.

To validate our marker, we calculated its distance from the
center of the stimulation electrode [see Fig. 1(b)].
III. RESULTS
A comparison across the “good” and “poor” groups showed
that although they started from the same baseline (t-test on offstate, preoperative UPDRS; p = 0.66, tstat = 0.45, df = 18,
SD = 11.7), the clinical outcome after DBS differed significantly (t-test on off-state, postoperative UPDRS; p = 0.002,
tstat = –3.55, df = 18, SD = 11.9). For each hemisphere we
tested, there was at least one trajectory with at least one beta peak
inside the STN. The beta peak with the highest amplitude across
microelectrodes was found in the trajectory that was intraoperatively selected for stimulation, in 13 out of 18 STN of “good”
responders and 16 out of 22 STN of “poor” responders. Our
proposed marker was located inside (or at the tip of) the stimulation contact that gave optimal clinical result for 10 “good” response STN (see Fig. 2). The marker had a distance of no larger
than 2 mm in at least one hemisphere for all “good” responders, with subject G9 being an exception. Two equivalent beta
peaks in the weighted sum were usually related to bimonopolar stimulation. For “poor-response” patients, the marker had a
distance of at least 2 mm in at least one of their hemispheres,

functions for “poor” and “good” response metrics. Distances in the two groups
were found to be statistically significant (t-test, p = 0.0025). Best fit estimates

“good” response data: μ (se) = 1.02 (0.58), σ (se) = 2.47 (0.43).

with subject P8 being an exception. The mean (SEM) distance
was 3.5 (0.97) mm and 1.0 (1.14) mm for “poor” and “good”
responders, respectively (see Fig. 3). The visual comparison
of the empirical and the theoretical (best normal fit) distributions of the metrics (see Fig. 4) was reinforced by a student’s
t-test that proposed a statistically significant difference in the
distances between the center of the stimulation area and the
proposed marker in the two groups of patients (p = 0.0025).
Interestingly, no statistical difference was found in the amplitude of the weighted aggregate beta peak between the two
groups (p > 0.9).

The long-term clinical outcome of STN-DBS, at least in terms
of a clustering of “poor” and “good” responders based on the
change in the off-state UPDRS, seems to be predicted by the
distance between the aggregate normalized beta peaks acquired
during the DBS implantation surgery. In our dataset, we found
that there was always an area of beta-band oscillations inside
the STN that, depending on the patient, was a distinct area or
not. This finding seems consistent with the hypothesis of betaband islands that seem to exist, at least in some patients, in STN
areas other than the dorsolateral area that one expects to find
sensorimotor activity (see [44, Fig. 1]). This speculation could
be reinforced by a functional organization model of the STN
(see [23, Fig. 9]) and a recent study on the spatially distributed
synchronizations as a key feature of STN pathophysiology in
Parkinsonian tremor [45]. In these studies, STN neurons are also
found to be clustered in high- and tremor-frequency patches that
are interweaved with nonoscillatory neurons; an indication of
different local functional neuronal organizations inside the STN.
If this hypothesis is true, then the “poor” responders might benefit from placing a stimulation contact close to the other neuronal
areas exhibiting prominent beta oscillations (see Fig. 2).
Mounting evidence suggests that beta-band oscillations are
related to the sensorimotor neurons exhibiting pathophysiological synchronization inside the STN and other brain structures.
A recent focus on the exaggerated beta-band (13–35 Hz) oscillations located in the cortico-basal ganglia pathways in patients
with “off-state” PD [46] paved the way for this activity to be
related to slowness and stiffness in PD [47] which are dominant features in movement assessment clinical metrics such as
the UPDRS scale we estimated pre- and postoperatively (see
Tables I and II). We speculate that the amplitude of the beta
peak could be related to the level (or extent) of beta synchronization, either locally (within the STN) or in the long range.
In that sense, the similar preoperative UPDRS levels between
“good” and “poor” responders were consistent with our finding of similar amplitudes in the weighed aggregate beta peak
acquired intraoperatively, across groups. In addition, we found
no relationship between: 1) the oscillation frequency and the
electrode location; and 2) the electrode location and the DBS
outcome. These findings are consistent with a recent study suggesting that the topography of the low- (10–20 Hz), and high(20–35 Hz) beta band does not differ in the STN [48] and another
concluding that “coordinate-based lead location does not predict
Parkinson’s disease deep brain stimulation outcome” [30].
The beta-peak metric was not available to the expert neurologist during follow up; his only guidance was the clinical
symptoms of the patients. On one hand, our proposed beta-band
marker was, in average, 1 mm away from the stimulation center
in the “good” responders providing further evidence for DBS
clinical results being associated with inhibition of beta oscillations [26], [27]. On the other hand, “poor” DBS responses are
clinically associated with a narrow therapeutic window, i.e., a
small range of stimulation currents that can provide effective
therapy without causing side effects. To speculate further, the
large (3.5 mm in average) difference between the beta marker

MICHMIZOS et al.: BETA-BAND FREQUENCY PEAKS INSIDE THE SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS AS A BIOMARKER FOR MOTOR IMPROVEMENT

and the center of stimulation area in the “poor” responders might
have prohibited the increase of the stimulation current up to a
therapeutic level due to the side effects that arose from stimulating the STN areas between the DBS contact and the beta marker.
The failures of the beta-band marker to fully comply with the
clinical outcome for 3 out of 20 PD patients could have a neurophysiological explanation related to the asymmetry of PD and
the effective therapeutic window. Specifically, G8’s beta-band
metric for the left STN was 4.25 mm. In PD, the neurodegenerative process often alters asymmetrically the dopaminergic
innervation of the two striata; this leads to lateralized onset
of motor symptoms with persisting asymmetry as the disease
progresses [49]. We determined that in this patient, the mostaffected side was the left one, being controlled by the right
hemisphere. Hence, despite the DBS lead misplacement on the
left STN, the positive clinical result was most probably due
to the precise stimulation of the right STN, which is consistent with the small beta-band metric on that side. What is
more, G9 exhibited large metrics bilaterally. Despite the substantial improvement in UPDRS, this patient suffered from
a partial amelioration of PD symptoms and subsequent rise
of stimulation-induced side effects (see Section II-C). The
clinical picture and the large beta-band metrics are consistent with a narrow therapeutic window in which the side effects do not allow for a further increase of the stimulation
current. Concerning the “poor” responders, P8 was reported
to respond poorly in DBS as he developed dysarthrophonic
speech and walking difficulty despite the addition of a second stimulation contact in a follow-up study (see Section II-C).
Yet, his beta-band markers for the left (right) STN were −2.25
(0.75) mm, a metric that would be expected to found in “good”
responders. The dysarthrophonic speech and the walking difficulty of the patient could possibly be explained by the spread
of the stimulus to other, unrelated to movement, adjacent structures (i.e., cerebello-rubro-thalamic fibers); this might have put
a constraint on the length of the therapeutic window as the
stimulation current (and hence the brain tissue volume that this
covers) could not increase to a therapeutic level.
In addition, there seems to be no clear connection between
downward displacement of the stimulation lead and the poor
DBS response as any downward displacement would result to
a smaller, not larger, metric. Consider, for example, pointB in
Fig. 1 and a stimulation lead downward displaced by X mm, 0 <
X ≤ 1.5 [9]. The new distanceB = d2 – (d1 + X) < d2 – d1 .
In other words, if the lead displacement was the reason for the
“poor” response, one would expect to find smaller metrics in
poor response and, therefore, the difference in metrics between
“poor” and “good” responders would not be significant.
Not only the presence of the beta peak but also the span
of the beta oscillations, as estimated by our proposed marker,
could potentially be used to decide upon the stimulation area.
The maximum beta peak was found close to the stimulation
contact depth, in most “good” responders. Multiple prominent
beta-band peaks were also present in patients with two stimulation contacts. These results are supportive of testing our
method with the next generation of deep brain stimulators that
will no longer be a single stripe of four contacts but, instead,

179

will comprise of a 3-D array of contacts [50] that will adapt
based on neurofeedback [51] after assessing the effect of their
own stimulation in the surrounding tissue [52]. Localization
of the most prominent beta peaks inside the STN could guide
the selective stimulation of the areas that would be closest to
the prominent beta peaks. However, since the pool of patients
is small in this study, we need to extend it before we reach to
general conclusions.
V. CONCLUSION
Our proposed method provides evidence that the optimal
long-term motor-related DBS clinical results and the minimization of the side effects can be informed by the beta-band peaks
acquired intraoperatively. When the stimulation was applied
in close proximity to the spatial extent of the most prominent
beta-oscillatory region, believed to overlap with the motor territories of the STN, PD patients responded well on DBS, for
at least two years after surgery. This biophysical signature of
long-term improvement after STN-DBS could prove useful in
guiding clinical decisions on the best electrode trajectory intraoperatively and the best stimulation contact(s) during and after
surgery.
