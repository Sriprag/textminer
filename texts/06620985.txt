A Three-Step Multimodal Analysis Framework
for Modeling Corticomuscular Activity
With Application to Parkinson’s Disease
Xun Chen, Z. Jane Wang, Senior Member, IEEE, and Martin J. McKeown

Abstract—Corticomuscular coupling analysis based on multiple
datasets such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals provides a useful tool for understanding
human motor control systems. A popular conventional method to
assess corticomuscular coupling has been the pair-wise magnitudesquared coherence (MSC) between EEG and concomitant EMG
recordings. However, there are certain limitations associated with
the MSC, including the difficulty in robustly assessing group inference, only dealing with two types of datasets simultaneously and
the biologically implausible assumption of pair-wise interactions.
To overcome such limitations, in this paper, we propose assessing
corticomuscular coupling by combining multiset canonical correlation analysis (M-CCA) and joint independent component analysis
(jICA). The proposed method takes advantage of the M-CCA and
jICA to ensure that the extracted components are maximally correlated across multiple datasets and meanwhile statistically independent within each dataset. Simulations were performed to illustrate
the performance of the proposed method. We also applied the proposed method to concurrent EEG, EMG, and behavior data collected in a Parkinson’s disease (PD) study. The results reveal highly
correlated temporal patterns among the three types of signals and
corresponding spatial activation patterns. In addition to the expected motor areas, the corresponding spatial activation patterns
demonstrate enhanced occipital connectivity in the PD subjects,
consistent with previous medical findings.

I. INTRODUCTION
TUDYING simultaneous cortical and muscular activities
during a sustained isometric muscle contraction, corticomuscular coupling analysis provides a unique way for assessing
some of the functional interactions in the motor control system. Magnitude-squared coherence (MSC), a normalized measure of correlation between two waveforms or signals in the
frequency domain, has been successfully used to assess the in-

teractions between motor-related brain areas and the muscles.
For example, in monkeys, the MSC in the 20–30 Hz band can
be detected between cortical local field potentials and the rectified electromyography (EMG) from contralateral hand muscles that are modulated during different phases of a precision
grip task [1]. In humans, similar MSC findings have also been
demonstrated in the beta-band between magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG) recordings
from the primary motor cortex and the EMG during isometric
contractions [2].
MSC has proved useful in assessing diseases of the human
motor system, particularly Parkinson’s disease (PD). An inverse
relation exists between beta-band corticomuscular MSC and the
clinical sign of bradykinesia in PD [3]. Cerebro-muscular MSC
appears unaffected in early PD, yet beta-band oscillations of
bilateral primary sensori-motor cortices are already increased at
the earliest stages of PD [4]. Later on, cerebro-muscular MSC is
reduced in nonmedicated PD, and medication [5] or deep brain
stimulation [3] normalizes this deficiency. Finally, M1-muscular
MSC is strongly reduced in both the alpha and beta bands during
repetitive movement compared to static contraction, but this is
unaffected by the administration of levodopa [6].
Despite MSC’s popularity in corticomuscular coupling analysis, there are several implicit assumptions of MSC that potentially limit its usefulness in practical scenarios. First, since the
exact frequency of maximum coupling typically varies across
subjects due to inherent intersubject variability, making a robust
group MSC inference is not straightforward. Second, MSC emphasizes the role of individual loci in the brain in driving the
motor system, while motor activity is known to be more distributed [7]. Third, the original MSC is pair-wise, i.e., dealing
with only two types of datasets or signals, while in practice,
we may need to simultaneously analyze more than two types
of signals, for example, brain, muscle, and behavioral data. Finally, when brain electrical activity is measured by the EEG,
applying MSC directly to raw EEG and EMG signals normally
yields a low coherence value, because only a small fraction of
ongoing EEG activity is related to motor control [8]. Extensive
statistical testing with all the associated assumptions is required
to determine whether the EEG/EMG coherence is statistically
significant.
Recently, several data-driven multivariate methods have been
developed for analyzing joint biological data that are well
suited for assessing corticomuscular coupling. These methods include multiple linear regression, principal component regression, independent component analysis (ICA), partial least

squares (PLS), and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) [9].
Both the PLS and CCA rely on latent variables (LVs), with the
PLS maximizing covariance and the CCA maximizing correlation [10]. However, an advantage of the PLS over CCA is
that the PLS can handle high dimensional and collinear data—
frequently the case in real-world biological applications—which
can make the CCA ill-conditioned. The PLS and its variants
have been investigated in many medical applications, such as
determining the spatial patterns of brain activity in functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data associated with behavioral measures [11], and the common temporal components
between the EEG and fMRI signals [12]. In addition, the PLS
can be extended to perform group level analysis and even accommodate multiway (e.g., time, EEG channel, and frequency)
data [13]. However, in current existing PLS frameworks, only
two types of datasets can be processed simultaneously, which
hinders their applications to corticomuscular activity analysis
during dynamic contractions, where inclusion of behavioral data
is desirable. Also, the PLS extracts the LVs that are uncorrelated
(as opposed to statistically independent) that can sometimes
complicate interpretations in real medical applications [14].
Unlike PLS, the CCA can be easily extended to accommodate multimodal data [15]. More recently, a simple and effective scheme to achieve joint blind source separation of multiple
datasets using multiset canonical correlation analysis (M-CCA)
has been proposed [16]. Under certain assumptions, the group of
corresponding sources from each dataset can be jointly extracted
by the M-CCA through maximizing the correlations among the
extracted sources. These sources can be named as canonical
variants (CVs). However, the M-CCA requires a stringent assumption that the correlation coefficients of the corresponding
sources between multiple datasets should be sufficiently distinct [16], which will be specified in Section II-A2 by (15). This
assumption may not be satisfied in practice. In addition, similar
to the PLS, the M-CCA considers only up to the second-order
statistics and it could be insufficient to obtain a unique LV model
if the data are not strictly multivariate Gaussian [17]. The ICA
assumes that the multivariate data are composed of a linear superposition of mutually statistically independent signal sources.
In statistics, independence is a much stronger condition than
uncorrelatedness, and thus the ICA algorithms typically employ
criteria related to information theory and/or entropy. The ICA
has found many potential biomedical applications [18]–[20].
However, the ICA still has the following drawbacks, with implications for corticomuscular analysis. First, the ICA is typically
used in isolation on one dataset at a time and thus ignores the
relations between the current dataset and all other datasets. Second, unlike principal component analysis which yields unique
and ranked principal components (PCs) by best explaining the
variance in the data, independent components (ICs) obtained
from classical ICA methods are not unique due to permutation
and/or dilation of the components. Even repeated analysis on
the same datasets, since stochastic learning is often employed,
may result in different ordering and scaling of components. To
overcome these drawbacks, joint independent component analysis (jICA), was developed to maximize the independence of
joint sources of multiple datasets [21]. However, in the jICA

1233

framework, all modalities are assumed to share the same mixing matrix, which may not be true in practice [21].
Thus, for the multimodal corticomuscular activity analysis,
both the M-CCA and jICA have their individual advantages
and disadvantages, and fortunately, these two methods can be
considered complementary. In this paper, we propose combining the M-CCA and jICA to improve the overall performance
of the joint source extraction. More specifically, we first adopt
the M-CCA to obtain CVs across multiple datasets and then
perform the jICA on the extracted LVs. In contrast to prior
approaches [22], [23], we generate common components from
sources rather than the mixing matrices and concentrate on multimodal/multiset data fusion. We utilize a joint preprocessing
strategy prior to the M-CCA for preserving major relevant information across multiple datasets yet still preventing the matrices
from becoming ill-conditioned. In fact, we employ a three-step
modeling strategy. In the first step, multivariate LV extraction,
formulated as a simple optimization problem, is established
for preliminary LV preparation to prevent ill-conditioning that
might occur if the M-CCA were directly applied to the raw data.
In the second step, the M-CCA is applied to the extracted LVs
for obtaining multiple sets of CVs, which may still contain mixtures of real independent sources. In the third step, the jICA is
performed on the concatenated CVs to extract joint ICs.
We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in both
synthetic data and real data. We first validate it on simulated
data and illustrate its performance. We then apply the method to
concurrent EEG, EMG, and behavior data (BEH) collected from
normal subjects and patients with PD when performing a dynamic force tracking task. We utilize the proposed method to extract highly correlated temporal patterns among the three types
of signals and also report the EEG spatial activation patterns.
II. METHODS
A. The Multimodal Method
The main contributions of the proposed method lies in its
ability to: 1) model multiple datasets/signals simultaneously,
overcoming the traditional constraint of analyzing only two
types of datasets, and 2) extract maximally correlated components across multiple datasets while simultaneously keeping
components within each individual dataset maximally statistically independent. In the following subsections, the three-step
modeling strategy, illustrated in Fig. 1, is described in detail.
1) Multi-LV Extraction: Suppose we have M datasets X 1
(size N × P1 ), X 2 (size N × P2 ), . . ., and XM (size N ×
PM ). All columns of the M data matrices are assumed
to be zero-mean and normalized to unit variance in advance. We define the sublatent variables (subLVs) in each
dataset to be linear combinations of the original variables, i.e.,
X 1 w1 , X 2 w2 , . . . , XM wM . One super latent variable (supLV) tg is designed to relate the subLVs, and it can be obtained
by solving the following optimization problem

Diagram of the proposed joint multimodal analysis method.

The subLV Xi wi for the ith dataset carries its associated variation information and (tg T Xi wi )2 models the covariance information between the subLV Xi wi and the supLV tg . The supLV
tg relates all the subLVs simultaneously and actually plays a
role as a linkage. By solving the above optimization problem, it
is expected that the extracted subLVs should carry as much variance information as possible in each individual dataset and at
the same time be correlated to each other as highly as possible.
If we employ the method of the Lagrange multipliers, we
rewrite the initial cost function as

where λg and λi ’s are the Lagrange multipliers.
Taking the derivatives of Ltg ,wi with respect to tg and wi ’s
and setting them to be zero, we have

(3)

∂Ltg ,wi
= 2(tg T Xi wi )Xi T tg − 2λi wi = 0,
∂wi
∀ i = 1, 2, . . . , M.

By left multiplying (3) with tg T and (4) with wi T , we can
easily derive the following equations
(tg T Xi wi )2 = λg

(5)

i=1

(tg T Xi wi )2 = λi ,

∀i = 1, 2, . . . , M.

The above equations indicate that λg is the underlying optimization objective and the λi ’s are suboptimal objective parameters, with the following relationship

λi = λg .

According to (5) and (6), we can modify (3) and (4) as follows

(12)
Using (10), several supLVs tg ’s, denoted by the matrix Tg , can
be derived according to the descending λg ’s. For each dataset
Xi , the same number of subLVs, denoted by Ti , can be readily
calculated by (12), rewritten as
∀i = 1, 2, . . . , M
(13)


where Di is a diagonal matrix with elements
λi . In real
applications, a practical issue is to determine the number of
supLVs. In our study, we determine the number by setting a
threshold that corresponds to the ratio of explained variance
(e.g., 90%).
From the above derivation process, we can see that the supLVs
Tg are actually thePCs of the concatenated data space, as shown
in (10), and the subLVs Ti ’s are extracted by regressing each
dataset onto the supLVs, as shown in (13). Therefore, the supLVs
can represent the global systematic variance information for all
the datasets and the subLVs Ti ’s can explain the local systematic
variance of the ith dataset.
While conceptually straightforward, there are, however, some
limitations of the above procedure. The subLVs calculated
through the above procedure may exhibit substantial collinearity since each dataset is used repetitively (12). Also, despite
the fact that we are interested in identifying the most highly
correlated components across multiple datasets, the subLVs
Ti = Xi Xi T Tg Di ,

derived above are not sorted according to the average correlation coefficient
 (acc) between corresponding subLV pairs,
i.e., acc(l) = M
i , j = 1 cc(ti,l , tj,l )/(M (M − 1)/2). We, therei= j

fore, propose a modified algorithm, described in Algorithm 1,
which ensures that the modified subLVs (MsubLVs) are uncorrelated with each other within each dataset and are automatically
ordered according to descending acc.
2) Multiset Canonical Correlation Analysis (M-CCA): Although the corresponding subLVs for multiple datasets may
be similar, the correlation coefficients among the subLVs are
not ensured to be maximized. This can be achieved by the MCCA, an extension of the CCA, whereby the correlation structure among multiple random vectors is maximized by linear
transformations. Unlike the CCA where correlation between
two canonical variates is maximized, the M-CCA aims to optimize an objective function of the correlation matrix of the
canonical variates from multiple random vectors in order to
make the canonical variates achieve the maximum overall correlation [16]. The M-CCA can achieve excellent performance,
especially when the datasets are large [16].
Here, the inputs to the M-CCA are the extracted MsubLVs
from the first-step, i.e., V 1 , V 2 , . . . , VM , and the outputs are
the extracted canonical variates with maximum correlation, i.e.,
C 1 , C 2 , . . . , CM . The associated decomposition can be expressed as
Vi = Ci Ai ,

∀i = 1, 2, . . . , M

(14)

where Ai is the mixing matrix associated with the ith dataset.
For simplicity, we keep the number of the canonical variates in
each dataset the same as the number of the MsubLVs.

1235

As mentioned in Section I, the M-CCA may fail to separate sources whose correlation coefficients are equal or very
close, particularly in real biomedical applications. Specifically,
if K sources can be extracted from each of the M datasets
correspondingly, the following requirement must be met to successfully recover the sources by the M-CCA
(α )
(β )
|rm
,n | = |rm ,n |,

(1 ≤ α < β ≤ K, ∀m, n ∈ 1, 2, . . . , M )
(15)
(β )
where |rm ,n | represents the correlation coefficient between the
βth source from the mth dataset and the βth source from the
nth dataset. Therefore, Ci should be regarded as incompletely
decomposed sources, i.e., mixtures of the true underlying ICs.
3) Joint Independent Component Analysis (jICA): To extract the true independent, in Step 3, we perform jICA on the
concatenated CVs to minimize their higher order statistical dependencies [21]
[C 1 ; C 2 ; . . . ; CM ] = [S 1 ; S 2 ; . . . ; S M ]A

(16)

where A represents the common mixing matrix and Si is the
extracted ICs from the ith dataset. We employed the FastICA
implementation of the ICA [17]. After the jICA, the underlying
sources S 1 , S 2 , . . ., Sm have been extracted from datasets X 1 ,
X 2 , . . ., Xm , with each column of S representing an individual source for the corresponding dataset. However, since the
sources have not been sorted according to the average correlation coefficients (acc), we calculated the acc for each column
index and sorted them from high acc to low acc. Initially, the
number of the joint ICs in each dataset was kept as the same as
the number of CVs and then the permutation test (see Section
II-C3) was applied to identify significant components.

We emphasize that the jICA assumes that all modalities share
the same mixing matrix, A, a constraint that is not always easily
satisfied in practice if it is naively applied to raw data. However,
in the proposed method, the M-CCA first links multiple datasets
via correlation and specifies CVs across the datasets, which
ameliorates this concern. In turn, the jICA further decomposes
the incompletely-demixed CVs and thus combining the M-CCA
and jICA are complementary.
B. Synthetic Data
In this subsection, we applied the proposed method to synthetic data and also implemented separate ICA (sICA), M-CCA,
and joint ICA, respectively, for comparison. As an illustrative
example, without loss of generality, six sources were generated
and analyzed.
The following six source signals were considered
s1 = sin(0.015t) + cos(0.005t)
s2 = 2cos(0.08t)sin(0.006t)
s3 = ECG,

s4 = EMG

s5 = 1.5cos(0.01t)sin(0.5t)
s6 = 1.5sin(0.025(t + 63))sin(0.2t)

(17)

where t denotes the time index vector, valued from 1 to 1000,
and si ’s (i = 1, 2, . . . , 6) represent the six simulated sources,
as shown in Fig. 2. Note that here si ’s are column vectors.
The three mixed datasets X 1 , X 2 , and X 3 were generated
as follows, with each row denoting one observation in their
respective data space

The sources s1 , s2 , and s3 existed in all the datasets, representing common information. The source s4 only contributed to
X 1 , s5 only to X 2 , and s6 only to X 3 , representing their own
unique information. Random Gaussian noise with 5% power
were added to Si s before generating the mixed datasets.
C. Real Data
In many medical applications, extrapolating one subject’s
data to a wide population range is clearly problematic because of
substantial intersubject variability. Therefore, analysis methods
for medical research requires a means to meaningfully achieve
a group level consensus. Rather than computing the corticomuscular activity for each subject individually and applying a
posthoc method for combining the results, the current method
allows for a group consensus. This is demonstrated in the following section, where the proposed method was applied to concurrent EEG, EMG, and BEH signals collected from normal
subjects and patients with PD during a motor task.
1) Data Collection: The study was approved by the University of British Columbia (UBC) Ethics Board. Nine PD patients
(mean age: 66 yrs) were recruited from the Pacific Parkinson’s
Research Centre at the UBC. They all displayed mild to moderate level of PD and were treated only with L-dopa. Eight
age-matched healthy subjects were recruited as controls. For
the PD subjects, testing was conducted as off-medication, since
the measurement was taken after a minimum of 12-hr withdrawal of L-dopa medication [24]. During the experiment, the
subjects were seated 2 m away from a large computer screen.
The visual target was displayed on the screen as a vertical yellow bar oscillating in height at 0.4 Hz. The subjects were asked
to squeeze a pressure-responsive bulb with their right hand. The
visual feedback representing the force output of the subject was
displayed as a vertical green bar superimposed on the target
bar as shown in Fig. 3. The subjects were instructed to make
the height of the green bar match the height of target bar as
closely as possible. Each squeezing period lasted for 15 s and
was followed by a 15-s rest period. The squeezing task was performed twice. The force required was up to 10% of maximum

signals, and behavioral performance measurements, constituting X 1b , X 2b , and X 3b , respectively, for each subject b (for
b = 1, 2, . . . , B). Suppose we have a total of B subjects (B = 17
in this study) and m types of datasets for each subject (m = 3 in
this study). To achieve a group analysis, all the subjects’ datasets
are correspondingly concatenated as
X 1 = [X 11 , X 12 , . . . , X 1B ]
X 2 = [X 21 , X 22 , . . . , X 2B ]
X 3 = [X 31 , X 32 , . . . , X 3B ]

voluntary contraction, which was measured at the beginning of
each recording session.
The EEG data were collected using an EEG cap (QuickCap, Compumedics, Texas, USA) with 19 electrodes based
on the International 10–20 system. The EEG data were sampled at 1000 Hz using SynAmps2 amplifiers (NeuroScan, Compumedics, Texas, USA). The data was later p band-pass filtered
(1 to 70 Hz) with a fifth order Butterworth filter offline and
down-sampled to 250 Hz. The artifacts associated with eye blink
and muscle activity were removed using the automated artifact
removal tool in EEGLAB (Gomez-Herrero, 2007). To simplify
the analysis, the EEG signals were divided into five regions
as shown in Fig. 4, including Fronto-Central (FCentral)—FP1,
FP2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, and F8; Left Sensorimotor (LSM)—T7, C3,
P7, and P3; Right Sensorimotor (RSM)—T8, C4, P8, and P4;
Central—Cz and Pz; and Occipital—O1 and O2. The raw time
sequences of the electrodes within each region were averaged
to represent the overall activity of the region, and the averaged
time sequence were then normalized to have zero-mean and unit
variance. For subsequent analyses, the data collected during the
squeezing periods were concatenated in time into a single matrix for each individual subject. Data from the rest periods were
excluded from the analysis.
The EMG signals were recorded using self-adhesive, silver,
silver-chloride pellet surface electrodes with 7-mm diameter. A
bipolar montage was used with a fixed interelectrode distance of
30 mm. The surface EMG signals were simultaneously collected
together with the EEG signals and were amplified and sampled
at 1000 Hz. To be consistent with the EEG preprocessing, the
EMG signals were down-sampled offline to 250 Hz and only
the squeezing periods were used for subsequent analysis. The
BEH signals were recorded from the pressure-responsive bulb,
representing the force performed by the subjects. Similarly, the
BEH signal from each subject was resampled to ensure its proper
alignment with other signals.
2) Feature Extraction: In most existing studies, the analysis for corticomuscular coupling is performed directly on raw
EEG and EMG data, typically yielding small correlation values.
However, with appropriate preprocessing steps, highly correlated EEG and EMG feature(s) can be identified from the raw
signals. In this paper, we examine the coupling relationships
among time-varying EEG features, the amplitude of the EMG

(22)

with the assumption that all subjects share common group patterns in the temporal dimension [20].
EEG Features: Band-limited, pair-wise EEG coherences [25]
were considered in this study since this type of time-varying features include temporal, spatial, and spectrum information simultaneously. The EEG coherence examines the relation between
the two EEG signals, which includes both power and frequency
information
Coh(f ) = |S e ∗ e ◦ (f )|2 /(S e ∗ e ∗ (f )S e ◦ e ◦ (f ))

(23)

where |S e ∗ e ◦ | is the cross-spectrum between the signals e∗ and
e◦ ; S e ∗ e ∗ is the autospectrum of the signal e∗ , and S e ◦ e ◦ is the
autospectrum of the signal e◦ . In this paper, we calculated the
time-varying pair-wise coherences between the EEG channels,
using a Hamming window with length 300 and with a 95%
overlap. To be consistent with common EEG practice, we further divide the coherence into four frequency bands, i.e., theta
band (4–8 Hz), alpha band (8–13 Hz), beta band (13–30 Hz),
and gamma band (30–70 Hz). The time-varying energy signals
in each band were then used as the EEG features. Therefore,
the raw EEG information can be represented by a 2-D matrix
with size N × P1 , where the rows correspond to the samples
at different time points and the columns correspond to the features, i.e., the pair-wise band-limited coherences between the
EEG channels.
EMG and BEH Features: An individual EMG channel signal can be considered as a zero-mean, band-limited, and widesense stationary stochastic process modulated by amplitude.
The EMG amplitude, which represents the overall muscle activity of individual underlying muscle fibers [26], is probably
the most popular EMG feature, but other techniques have been
proposed for accurate amplitude estimation. Here, we employ
the root-mean-square approach to calculate the EMG amplitude
of short-duration EMG signals x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ):

A moving window with length 300 and a 95% overlap is applied
in our study. Note that the window size used here is the same
as in the EEG coherence calculation. This is to ensure that the
obtained EEG and EMG features are temporally aligned and
matched. Similarly, the BEH measurement sequence from each
subject is resampled to ensure the same temporal length as that
of the EEG and EMG features.
3) Significance Assessment: To determine the statistical
significance of the extracted components, we utilized the

1238

nonparametric permutation test [27]. The temporal correlations
among EEG, EMG, and BEH were removed by permuting the
temporal order of the EEG features X 1 and EMG features X 2
uniformly for all subjects while keeping the BEH features X 3
unchanged. One hundred random permutations were generated
and the proposed method described in Section II-A was applied
to each of these permutations. The average correlation coefficients among the extracted temporal patterns from the permuted
EEG and EMG features, as well as the unchanged BEH features
were then calculated to form an empirical null distribution. The
p-value of the original EEG/EMG/BEH average correlation was
then estimated from the null distribution as the probability of
observing a value at least as extreme as the original correlation in the null distribution. The components with p-value being
less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant, denoted
as U 1 , U 2 , and U 3 , all with size (N × K), where K is the
number of significant components.
4) Spatial Pattern Extraction: In order to aid in the biological interpretation of the results, we also derived connectivity patterns between the EEG channels representing functional connections between the brain regions. After the identification of significant temporal patterns, we regressed the EEGrelated components U 1 back onto the EEG features X 1b (for
b = 1, 2, . . . , B) for all subjects as follows

1
pbk =
X T uk , k = 1, 2, . . . , K. (25)
T
uk X 1b X T1b uk 1b
where uk is the kth column of U 1 and pbk is the connectivity pattern of the kth component for subject b. In addition, we
also want to determine which EEG features in the connectivity patterns have significant contributions to the corresponding
temporal patterns. This is done by identifying the EEG features
that have weights statistically significantly different from zero.
To determine the group-level connectivity pattern, for each significant component, we applied a two-tailed t-test to each connectivity feature across all subjects in each subject group.
III. RESULTS
A. Simulation Results
The extracted underlying components using separate ICA,
joint ICA, M-CCA, and the proposed method are shown in
Fig. 5(a)–(d), respectively. We also made a quantitative comparison between these methods by calculating average correlation coefficients for each method [see Fig. 5(e)]. The separate
ICA approach recovered the original sources accurately in all
datasets as expected, but was unable to meaningfully relate the
three datasets or rank the ICs appropriately. Although a subsequent source match via cross-correlation could be used to order
the sources, this may introduce ambiguity especially when the
estimated component number is high. By using joint ICA, the
first jointly extracted sources, although perhaps less accurate,
are at least highly relevant to each other. But the remaining extracted sources seem to be uninformative due to the stringent
assumption that all modalities share the same mixing matrix.
The LVs extracted by the M-CCA were at least automatically

and neatly ordered in terms of their average correlation coefficient values among the datasets. However, compared with the
original sources, the extracted LVs were distorted, suggesting
1) performance of the M-CCA may suffer when the condition
indicated by (15) is not satisfied, and 2) uncorrelatedness may
not be a sufficiently rigorous criterion to accurately recover the
underlying sources. When the proposed method was employed,
the dominant sources which made significant contributions to all
datasets were accurately identified and ordered, with the focus
entirely on sources common across multiple datasets. In summary, the proposed method mitigates the deficiencies of both
the M-CCA and joint ICA and can separate sources accurately
and link them correctly in a less-constrained condition.
B. Results From Real Data
The proposed method was applied to the EEG, EMG, and
BEH features generated using the procedure described in Section II-C2 from eight normal and nine PD subjects simultaneously. The joint modeling of the normal and the PD data allows
for the identification of common temporal patterns across the
groups, while the connectivity patterns may be different across
subjects. This allows for the identification of specific correlation
connections that are differentially recruited by the PD subjects
during the motor task.
Here, X 1b , X 2b , and X 3b (b = 1, 2, . . . , B) represent the
time-varying feature matrices of EEG, EMG, and BEH for the
bth subject, respectively. The length of the original raw EEG
and the simultaneously recorded EMG data for each subject
was 7485 associated with the sampling frequency 250 Hz. As
mentioned before, after using the 300-length moving window
and a 95% overlap, the length of time points (the matrix row)
here was 480. For the EEG coherences, there are five brain
regions and four frequency bands, indicating there are a total
of C25 × 4 = 40 variables. Thus, X 1b is of size 480 × 40. For
the EMG amplitude feature, since there are two surface EMG
channels, X 2b was 480 × 2, and the BEH dataset X 3b was size
480 × 1. The group analysis datasets X 1 , X 2 , and X 3 were
generated by (22).
Using the permutation test, one significant component (pvalue ≤ 0.05) was identified. The temporal and spatial patterns
for this component are shown in Fig. 6. The acc among the EEG,
EMG, and BEH scores was 0.7946 (with p-value = 0.0015).
Note that in the figure only connections whose weights were
statistically significantly different from zero are shown.
Although there were some similarities in the brain regions
and connections recruited by the PD and control groups, there
still existed significant differences (see Fig. 6). In theta and
alpha bands, normal subjects demonstrated fronto-parietal and
fronto-occipital connections which were completely missing in
PD subjects. In the beta band, the normal subjects had connections between the L sensorimotor cortex and the frontal and R
sensorimotor regions that were absent or reduced in PD subjects.
In the gamma band, the PD subjects had increased connectivity between the frontal regions and the central and sensorimotor cortices that were missing in controls. Finally, PD subjects
had a significant connection between the L sensorimotor and

occipital regions in the theta, alpha, and gamma bands that was
not present in controls.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this paper, we have proposed a three-step multimodal data
analysis method to assess corticomuscular coupling based on
combining the advantages of the M-CCA and jICA. The simulation results support the usefulness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, when applied to real data, promising results based
on detecting significant differences between the PD subjects and
age-matched controls were detected.
In most corticomuscular coupling studies, the EEG activity
at a specific locus (e.g., sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the
hand performing the task) is directly compared to the EMG signals during sustained contraction. However, we find that in this

study, the band-limited coherences between certain brain regions are closely associated with ongoing EMG/BEH features
during a dynamic motor task (see Fig. 6). This may be related to
the fact that during a dynamic motor task, the subjects may need
to recruit additional regions such as frontal regions for motor
selection [28], contralateral (i.e., ipsilateral to hand movement)
sensorimotor cortex for fine modulatory control [29], and occipital regions for posterror adaptations [30].
The observed results in the PD and control groups are in accord with previous medical findings. We found widespread connectivity between the frontal, central, and ipsilateral (right) sensorimotor regions and ongoing EMG/BEH activity from Fig. 6.
It is suggested that during visually guided tasks, the PD subjects may generate detectable widespread oscillatory disruption
in the EEG (e.g., [31]). This likely represents a compensatory
mechanism of cortical regions to overcome deficiencies in the

1240

It may seem paradoxical that the PD subjects have reduced
beta-band connectivity in the sensorimotor cortex compared
with controls, especially since the PD subjects may have enhanced beta-band EEG activity associated with the clinical signs
of bradykinesia and rigidity [37], [42]. We believe that this is
because the current method specifically looks at the common
sources among the EEG, EMG, and behavior signals. Because
a key aspect in PD is the inability to modulate the beta-band
oscillations [43], it is very likely that the fraction of beta-band
activity that varies with phasic EMG/BEH activity is reduced in
PD.
In this paper, we were able to find common temporal patterns
in both PD and controls assuming different connectivity origins
of the common signal. We have shown that the distributed EEG
connectivity patterns required to generate the common temporal pattern differ between PD and controls. One could envision
situations where the connectivity patterns are similar, but the
temporal profiles are significantly different. Nevertheless, usually behavioral tasks are specifically chosen so that the PD and
control subjects can still perform the task with roughly equal
accuracy. Otherwise, any differences in brain activation may
be dismissed as simply that the PD and control subjects were
performing different tasks.
Finally, we note that while the proposed framework was intentionally developed for corticomuscular coupling analysis, it
can be generally applied to other types of concurrent signals
and thus the proposed framework may be a promising tool for
multisubject and multimodal data analysis.

basal ganglia to perform motor tasks, as has been observed in
the fMRI studies [32]. The lack of fronto-central and frontooccipital activities in the theta and alpha bands seen in the PD
subjects compared to controls may reflect impaired spatial attention [33], as impairment of maintenance of attention has been
well described in the PD subjects (e.g., [34]). The weaker beta
band connection between the L and R sensorimotor regions in
PD may reflect the decreased ability for fine modulatory control [29]. The increased gamma connectivity in PD likely represents the extra effort that the PD subjects require for motor
task switching [35]–[37], a problem common in PD [38]. We
also found that connections with occipital regions are prominent
in the PD subjects. The enhanced occipital connectivity in the
theta, beta, and gamma bands may relate to the fact that the PD
subjects heavily rely on visual cues for the initiation [39] and
ongoing control of movement [40]. In addition, the increased
intra and interhemispheric connections we observed in the PD
subjects are consistent with the findings in previous MEG studies during the resting state [41].
