Abstract—Goal: The purpose of this study was to design a
method for extracting the volitional EMG from recorded surface
electromyography (EMG), contaminated by functional electrical
stimulation (FES) artifact. Methods: Considering that the FES artifact emerges periodically with rather large amplitude in nonstationary EMG, we designed an adaptive-matched filter (AMF) via
genetic algorithm (GA) optimization. Both the simulated and real
data from seven subjects were processed, using the GA-AMF filter
and comb filter, respectively. To test the filtering effect on the EMG,
contaminated with FES artifact of different current intensities, the
contaminated EMG was simulated by combining the simulation
artifact and clean EMG with various FES artifacts to clean EMG
ratios. Results: The results show that, in simulation test, compared
to the EMG filtered by comb filter, the simulated EMG (p < 0.05),
filtered by using GA-AMF, had significantly higher correlation coefficient, higher signal to noise ratio, and lower normalized root
mean square error, whereas the real EMG (p < 0.05), filtered by
using GA-AMF had higher power reduction than that filtered by
using comb filter. The results indicate that GA-AMF can effectively remove FES artifact from the EMG of the stimulated muscle
and its adjacent muscle, and the GA-AMF filter performed better
than did the comb filter. Conclusion: All these results demonstrate
that the GA-AMF filter is capable of extracting volitional EMG
from the stimulated muscle and adjacent muscles. Significance:
GA-AMF could provide technical support for improving EMG
feedback control of FES rehabilitation system.

contraction and corresponding joint movement has been popularly used to restore paralyzed motor functions caused by spinal
cord injury [3], [4]. It also has wide applications in cardiac and
diaphragmatic pacing [5], [6], pain management [7], truncal
stability [8], improvement of bone and muscle health [9], as
well as in restoring function or preventing loss of function [10].
With the stimulation patterns specifically adjusted depending
on the subjects’ muscle activities, the electrical stimulus pulses
needed to induce and control neural activations can be controlled for functional restoration [10] through surface or subcutaneous electrodes. At the same time, surface electromyography
(EMG), a noninvasive method to measure muscle activities, is
extensively used in investigating muscle function and fatigue
[11]–[14]. However, recorded EMG signals are easily contaminated by FES artifacts due to EMG amplifiers’ simultaneous
recording of stimulus current during electrically elicited contractions [15] and by artifacts induced by electrical pulse with
high amplitude. For a better understanding of FES-induced muscle activities measured with EMG, removing/eliminating the
artifacts caused by electrical stimulation is of vital importance.
An FES system usually generates constant low-frequency
stimulation pulses that will be mixed with the recorded EMG of
harmonic frequencies collected from the stimulated muscle. Removing such FES artifacts by using a frequency decomposition
method is difficult because of the overlapping of EMG and FES
artifact in the frequency domain. Using a blank window method
for artifact removal, several studies [16], [17] have attempted
to use the EMG signal as the feedback to predict and control
stimulation current. However, such blank window method could
not remove long-lasting artifact by extending the blanking time
only. FES artifact may last for milliseconds or even tens of
milliseconds because of the acquisition device, tissue properties, electrode properties, and other reasons [15]. Therefore, the
blank window method failed to extract the EMG from lower
limb muscles stimulated by surface FES. Some research groups
also tried to apply fixed comb filter and two-stage peak detection
algorithm, under the assumption that the FES artifact and the
M-wave generated by the stimulation are stationary [18]–[20].
However, those methods could not remove FES artifact under
high stimulation intensity, which could easily induce deformation of FES artifact due to capacitive characteristics of muscle.
Thus, the present study aims at removing the artifact evoked
by FES from the recorded EMG for a clean EMG signal, so
that we can understand more about muscle activities and the effect of stimulation, as also about the controlling of stimulation.

We proposed a novel technique using an adaptive-matched filter
algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA-AMF). Its performance, on both simulated data and real data, was compared
with that of comb filter (one of the most effective methods for
FES artifact removal [21], [22]).
II. EMG SIGNALS-EXPERIMENTAL RECORDINGS
AND METHODS
A. Subjects
Seven healthy subjects (three males and four females, age:
23.5 ± 1.5 years; body weight: 64.8 ± 19.2 kg; height: 1.722
± 0.102 m) participated in this study. None of the subjects
reported history of musculoskeletal disorder. To exclude the
impact of residual fatigue, the subjects were advised not to take
up any strenuous exercise 24 h prior to the commencement of the
experiment. The study was approved by the ethical committee
of Tianjin University.
B. Experimental Setup and Protocols
Parastep I NMES system by Sigmedics Inc. (USA) was used
to stimulate the quadriceps muscle for inducing effective muscle
contraction, with electrodes placed over the motor points of the
quadriceps muscle. The stimulation pulse width (300 μs) and
frequency (25 Hz) were preset and kept stable during the whole
experiment procedure [10]. The stimulation amplitudes ranged
from 0 to 150 mA (470 Ω), with an increment step of 10 mA.
An EMG system (Noraxon TELEMYO 2400T transmitter
and Noraxon MyoResearch Master Edition software, Noraxon
USA, Scottsdale AZ, USA) was used to record EMG signals
during knee joint movement. The skin was first wiped with alcohol, and then pregelled disposable surface electrodes were
placed (F55, Tianjin Zhuyou, Tianjin, China). Each electrode
had a dual silver/silver chloride recording surface with aggressive hydro-gel adhesive and can be repositioned on the same
patient. With a telemetric transmitter attached to the subject,
two pairs of surface electrodes (interelectrode distance of 2 cm)
were placed, one pair over the muscle belly of rectus femoris
(RF) and the other over gastrocnemius muscle (GM). The conductive area of each electrode was 1 cm in diameter. The EMG
signals were sampled at 1.5 kHz with a 12-b resolution and then
transmitted to a computer through Noraxon Wireless PC LAN
card. The signals were digitized online and stored in a computer
equipped with Noraxon Myoresearch XP software.
At the commencement of the experiment, the subjects were
seated with the shank free to swing. Each subject took voluntary movement session and FES induced movement session
separately.
In the voluntary movement session, the clean EMG data were
recorded during knee extension from a relaxed position (with
knee angle at approximately 90°) to full extension (with knee
angle at 180°). The subjects were asked to perform six cycles of
voluntary movement. Each cycle included knee extension and
flexion for a duration of 1 s and a relax interval of approximately
2 s. Thus, the total duration of each cycle is 3 s. The EMG
data collected in the middle cycles (the third and fourth cycles)
were further adopted in the simulation, because they were more

similar to the natural contraction than the cycles at the beginning
or the end of the session.
In the FES induced movement session, stimulation current
was delivered to the knee extensors (quadriceps muscle group)
of the right leg. Stimulation intensity was first increased in steps
of 10 mA from 0 level (0 mA) to the level that induced full knee
extension and then decreased in steps of 10 mA back to level 0.
Electrical stimulation at each level of intensity lasted 4 s. Upon
the stimulation current reaching the level of 60 mA, recording of
the EMG signals started. The recorded EMG was contaminated
by the FES artifact and would be used later for simulating FES
artifact. For healthy adults, 60 mA, based on Parastep I system,
was a modest level of stimulation which could generate slight
movement but was not high enough to induce contraction with
a large joint displacement.
C. Generating Contaminated EMG With Various FES
Artifacts to Clean EMG Ratios for Simulation
The experimental and filtering process is illustrated as a flow
chart (see Fig. 1). The EMG data from voluntary movement
with a cycle of 3 s were used as clean EMG s(t).
When recording EMG from a stimulated muscle or its adjacent muscles, it is impossible to separate muscle contraction
from FES artifact prior to filtering. The global average method
is the most basic average method that averages the signal over
all segments [18]. The simulated FES artifact n(t) was calculated through averaging the same subject’s EMG g(t) recorded
during FES using the global average method, as described below. Every FES waveform consisted of a pair of a positive pulse
and a negative pulse with equal charge (pulse amplitude 60 mA)

QIU et al.: STIMULUS ARTIFACT REMOVAL TECHNIQUE FOR SEMG SIGNAL PROCESSING DURING FES

1961

For the ith segment, the FES template was estimated as the
average signal of 2kw + 1 segments in its vicinity

for security (see Fig. 2). Since the FES frequency is 25 Hz, the
duration of each FES cycle is 0.08 s. Therefore, the EMG signal
recorded during FES was segmented with 0.08-s epochs based
on the cycle of FES system. FES artifact [n(t)] was extracted
from real contaminated EMG [g(t)] recorded during FES
n(t) =

N
1 
gi (t)
N i=1

(1)

where n(t) is the simulated FES artifact, and gi (t) is the ith
segment of the EMG recorded during FES; N represents the
total number of segments. The 3-s EMG recorded during each
movement cycle included 37 epochs of 0.08 s and a remainder
of 0.04 s which was discarded. Therefore, N is 37 in the above
equation. FES artifact [n(t)] would be mixed with clean voluntary EMG to simulate contaminated EMG in the simulation
test.
The simulated contaminated EMG x(t) was the sum of the
clean voluntary EMG s(t) and weighted FES artifact n(t).
x(t) = s(t) + α · n(t)

(2)

where α is the ratio between FES artifact and clean voluntary
EMG, i.e., 0.3, 0.5, 1, 1.3, 1.5, and 2 (see Section II-F). It
is to be noted that the recorded EMG in the FES system was
also contaminated by some nonadditive noise which was of low
amplitude [18] and could hence be ignored for the present study.
D. GA-AMF Filter for FES Artifact Removal
The adaptive-matched filter (AMF) via genetic algorithm
(GA) optimization was specifically designed to remove FES
artifact.
1) FES Artifact Estimation Using Dynamic Average: As an
initial step of the GA-AMF algorithm, a dynamic averaging
method was used to estimate the FES artifact template from
the contaminated EMG signal contained in the GA-AMF. Segments with similar shapes of FES artifact were averaged as
a good estimator for the artifact [18]. Such a dynamic averaging method [18] has the advantage of overcoming the dynamic changes of artifact characteristics. Additionally, several
continuous segments with temporal similarity can be averaged.

Xj (t)

j =i−k w

2kw + 1

(3)

where vi (t) is the ith segment of estimated FES template v(t),
and Xj (t) is the jth segment of the contaminated EMG signal,
which acts as the input signal of GA-AMF; kw is a positive
integer, which is selected as 3 for the present study. When the
number of segments before or after the ith segment was smaller
than kw , only the available segments were used for averaging
[18]. The template was calculated individually considering the
differences between the subjects’ muscle properties.
2) AMF: With the template of FES artifact [v(t)] identified
in the above step, GA-AMF filter was designed to detect and
remove FES artifact mixed with the input signal. With the input
of the contaminated EMG and the output of the extracted FES
artifact in the AMF filter, the difference between the input and
output signals gives the filtered EMG. The AMF filter can be
established using a finite impulse response digital filter with
an impulse response h(t) = n(t0 − t), where t0 is determined
specifically to maximize the ratio (r0 ) between the FES artifact
and the filtered EMG [23] according to the following equation:
r0 = 

|yn (t0 )|
E { ys (t)2 }

(4)

where t0 is the time when r0 reaches the maximum, E is the
mathematical expectation of ys (t)2 . ys (t) = s(t)∗ h(t) is the
convolution of the signal s(t) with the filter response h(t). Similarly, yn (t) = n(t)∗ h(t). Here, r0 with high values indicates
that more FES artifact can be detected and a clean EMG can be
obtained.
Before the matched filter detects the FES artifact, the original signal would first pass the whitening filter to remove the
correlated components in the signal [s(t)] with a linear adaptive
autoregressive (AR) model.
s(t) =

M


wi (t)s(t − i) + εt , 0 ≤ i ≤ M

i=0

where M is the order of the filter, s(t − i) is delay of s(t) by i, εt
is the modeling error that gradually approximates white noise
if the model is correct. The set of AR parameters is represented
as W (t) = [w1 (t), w2 (t), . . . , wM (t)]. By selecting the proper
order M, the whitening filter can be adjusted so that it does
not predict the stimulation artifact n(t). Therefore, when the
contaminated EMG is received by the whitening filter, its output
is as given below
y(t) = x(t) −

where nwhite (t) is the distorted signal after passing through the
whitening filter. When the observation window order M is small

1962

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015

enough, the high frequency components are no longer included
in the AR model, and the detection of nwhite (t) is equivalent
to the detection of n(t) [23]. The integral value of M ranging
from 2 to 5 was determined by the GA that will be explained
in the next section. The adaptive least mean square algorithm
[24] was used to compute W (t), with gradient search method
which updates the filter coefficients for each input signal V (t) =
K ∗ [v(t), v(t + 1), . . . , v(t + M − 1)] [24]. K is the multiple.
W (t + 1) = W (t) + 2μe(t)V (t)

(7)

where μ is the filter’s searching step size that can determine the
filtering speed, and e(t) represents the instantaneous error of the
filter based on the following equation:
e(t) = x(t) − W (t)H V (t)

(8)

where H is conjugate transpose operator. W (0) = {0}.
Before running the AMF algorithm, the three parameters (M,
μ, K) of AMF, which are critical to filtering performance, need
to be initialized based on experience, and GA was applied to
estimate these filter parameters.
3) Optimization of AMF by Using GA: GA, a global method
of searching by simulating the natural biological evolution [25],
was used to optimize the parameters (M, μ, K) of AMF following
the procedures given below:
1) Encoding: Since the three parameters (M, μ, K) are real
numbers, encoding the problem’s input data is real value
encoding. An individual represents a set of parameters for
AMF.
2) Fitness Value and Objective Function: Objective function
is used to calculate the fitness value (J) of each individual
in the population. An individual with higher fitness value
indicates a better solution for AMF than the one with
lower value. The objective function is defined as follows:
J=

∞


(q1 |eJ (i)| + q2 e2J (i)) + q3 P0

(9)

i=0

where eJ (i) is the removed FES artifact, calculated as the
difference between the contaminated EMG and the filtered
EMG after removal of FES artifact; P0 is the energy ratio
between the removed FES artifact and the EMG, filtered
by using GA-AMF; q1 , q2 and q3 are the corresponding
weights. This objective function is characterized by the
removed FES artifact signal, its energy, and the energy
ratio between removed part and remaining part. Higher
values of J indicate more effective removal of FES artifact
and much cleaner filtered EMG. Here, q1 + q2 = 1, q1 =
0.999, q2 = 0.001, q3 = 0.01. J value was used to select
the optimal individual by comparing individuals in the
population.
3) Genetic Operators: Populations are produced adopting
the following procedures [25], [26]. First, individuals (M,
μ, K) with high fitness values were selected directly for
the next population. The crossover operation was implemented by combining genetic information from two parent
individuals to produce a new individual. Then, to avoid
being trapped into locally optimal solution prematurely,
this updated individual was modified using mutation op-

eration implemented by adding a random value to the
parameters (M, μ, K) and limiting their values to the preselected ranges.
The output of AMF is the detected FES artifact. The output of
GA-AMF is defined as the difference between the contaminated
EMG (the filter input) and the detected FES artifact. In other
words, the output of GA-AMF is the clean EMG.
The initialization of GA-AMF was based on the following
parameters: population size = 30, crossover probability = 0.7,
mutation probability = 0.1, maximum generation = 100. q1 =
0.999, q2 = 0.00, q3 = 0.01. The value of M ranged from 2 to
5; μ was set at values between 0 and 1; for RF, 0 < K < 3,
and for GM, 1 < K < 10, and the parameters (M, μ, K) will be
randomly initialized in these ranges.
E. Simulation and Test
Experiments were conducted on simulated and real EMG signals of the seven subjects to show the effectiveness of GA-AMF.
For a comparison with the proposed method, the conventional
comb filter was involved as well. The comb filter is a commonly
used and well-performing filter; it accentuates or attenuates the
input signal at regularly spaced frequency intervals. In our experiment, the fixed comb filter was used to remove interference
at 12.5 Hz and its corresponding harmonics.
First, performances of the GA-AMF filter and comb filter
were evaluated using simulated contaminated EMG with FES
artifact to clean EMG ratio of 1.
Second, to test the filtering effect on EMG contaminated
by FES of various intensities, contaminated EMG were first
simulated by mixing FES artifact and clean EMG in various
ratios (six ratios: 0.3, 0.5, 1, 1.3, 1.5, and 2), and then comb
filter and GA-AMF filter were used separately to filter the FES
artifact from the simulated contaminated EMG.
Third, AMF needs to be set with optimized parameters to help
boost processing speed, and the optimized parameters (M, μ, K)
were obtained by filtering the contaminated EMG (in the ratio
level of 1) using GA-AMF filter. The optimized parameters were
then set as the fixed parameters of AMF to filter the contaminated
EMG (in the other ratio levels) to investigate the difference
between GA-AMF and fixed parameters AMF.
Fourth, the real contaminated EMG signals were separately
filtered by a comb filter and a GA-AMF filter.
F. Filter Performance Evaluation
Performance of the GA-AMF filtering on simulated contaminated EMG from the seven subjects was evaluated and compared
with that of comb filter. The following parameters, which could
evaluate the filtering effect and distortion, including correlation
coefficients [27], signal-noise-ratio (SNR) [28], normalized root
mean squared error (NRMSE), and frequency spectrum [29],
were calculated for each filtering method.
First, correlation coefficients between the clean EMG and
the filtered EMG provided a quantitative measure of filtering
performance in the time domain [27]. To make an objective
comparison of the two filters, correlation coefficients based on
Pearson correlation with significance level of 0.05 were used

filter; (d) EMG filtered using GA-AMF filter. Their corresponding spectral
distributions were displayed on the right column (e)–(h).

as an evaluation index. Higher correlation coefficients indicate
greater filtering performance.
Second, the SNR, defined as the ratio of the mean energy
of the clean EMG signal s(t) to the mean energy of the noise
[28], was used to evaluate the overall improvement of signal
quality. Higher SNR values signify better filtering performance.
SNR was calculated for both the input signal x(t) and the output
signal y(t) of the filter, following the artifact-removing procedure
summarized below

Third, the root mean square error (RMSE) was used to analyze
the average difference between clean EMG and filtered EMG.
To compare filtering performance among signals with different amplitude ranges, RMSE was normalized by the standard
deviation of clean EMG, resulting in NRMSE.

spectral distributions were displayed on the right column (e)–(h).

Fourth, to compare the clean and filtered EMG distributions
in frequency domain, spectra of the clean EMG and of the EMG
filtered using GA-AMF filter or comb filter were obtained by
using a sequential Fourier transform.
Lastly, since the real clean EMG cannot be measured separately in FES experiments, it is impossible to calculate SNR or
assess filter performance with real data. Therefore, power reduction (PR) was used as an alternative to SNR. It is defined as
the ratio between power of the input signal [contaminated EMG
g(t)] and power of the output signal [filtered EMG, yg (t)] [30].

It is to be noted that although PR is not a direct measurement
of filter performance when processing real data, it does, at least,
indicate the extent of FES artifact removal.
G. Statistical Analysis
Additional statistical analyses were applied to compare the
performances of removing FES artifact from the contaminated
EMG signal.
Two-tailed paired t-test was used to compare the differences
between GA-AMF filter and comb filter, and between GA-AMF
filter and fixed parameters AMF filter. Bonferroni correction was
applied to counteract the increased likelihood of type I error of
multiple comparisons. The significance level for each family of
the tests was set as 0.05. The p value of each t-test was adjusted
by multiplying the number of tests in the family. The reported
p value was the adjusted value.
The two-way repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with filter method (comb and GA-AMF) and ratio
of FES artifact to clean EMG (six ratios: 0.3, 0.5, 1, 1.3, 1.5, 2)
as factors was applied to assess their dependence the effect of
FES artifact removal. Significance level was set as 0.05.

III. RESULTS
A. Effect of FES Artifact Removal
Fig. 3 illustrates an example of filtering the simulated contaminated EMG of the right RF using comb filter and GA-AMF
filter, respectively. Signals were obtained in both the time and
frequency domains. Fig. 3(a) shows the clean EMG obtained
from the right RF during voluntary movement. Fig. 3(b) shows
the simulated contaminated EMG which was the sum of the
clean EMG and the FES artifact. The simulated contaminated

EMG was in the SNRx level of −16.32 dB. Fig. 3(c) shows
the EMG filtered using a comb filter, and Fig. 3(d) the EMG
filtered using GA-AMF filter with minimal observable residual
FES artifact. As can be seen in the right column of Fig. 3, the
filtered EMGs [see Fig. 3(c) and (d)] and the clean EMG [see
Fig. 3(a)] have similar spectra [see Fig. 3(e), (g) and (h)] in
the frequency domain. Similarly, Fig. 4 shows an example of
filtering the simulated contaminated EMG from the right GM of
the same subject. Although the spectrum graph contains some
distortions, it can be said that both the filters could effectively
eliminate FES artifact (see Figs. 3 and 4).
The performances of the comb filter and of the GA-AMF filter
were evaluated and compared using the following parameters: 1)
Correlation coefficient between the clean EMG and the filtered
EMG; 2) SNRy of the filtered EMG; 3) NRMSEy of the filtered
EMG. The signal to be filtered was the contaminated EMG with
FES artifact to clean EMG ratio of 1. The results of comparison
for both RF and GM are summarized in Tables I to III. For
both RF and GM, GA-AMF filter shows a higher correlation
coefficient (p < 0.01), a higher SNRy (p < 0.05), and a lower
NRMSEy (p < 0.01) than those shown by comb filter.
The optimal values of (M, μ, K) parameters in respect of the
seven subjects are presented in Table IV. Here, M is the order of
the filter, and μ is the filter’s step size that could determine the

filtering speed. The FES template signal was calculated using the
input signal of GA-AMF, V (t) = K ∗ [v(t), v(t + 1), . . . , v(t +
M − 1)], where K is the coefficient. Table IV shows great variability among different subjects, and the K values in the filters
for RF and VI are significantly different. From the pilot experiments, when the value of K was set at the same range to filter
the contaminated EMG of the two muscles, the values of K, obtained from GA-AMF, showed significant difference. Thus, to
make the solution space clear, different value ranges of K were
adopted for different subjects in the experiment.
B. Effect of Filter Type and Artifact to EMG Ratio on
Artifact Removal
Two types of filters (comb and GA-AMF) were applied separately on the contaminated EMGs from RF with six ratios
between artifact and EMG (0.3, 0.5, 1, 1.3, 1.5, and 2), and their
filtering performances were evaluated and compared.
First, the contaminated EMGs with the six FES artifact-toclean EMG ratios were analyzed before applying any filter.
The average results obtained in respect of the seven subjects
are presented in Fig. 5. It may be noted that, for the analysis
of contaminated EMG, correlation coefficient and NRMSEx

were calculated between clean EMG and contaminated EMG,
whereas SNRx was obtained by the ratio of clean EMG to
FES artifact, expressed using the logarithmic decibel scale. The
mean correlation coefficients ranged from 0.45 to 0.07, the mean
SNRx from −6.94 to −22.42 dB, and the mean NRMSEx from
2.02 to 13.44. With increase in the ratio between FES artifact and
EMG, the mean values of correlation coefficients and the mean
SNRx decreased, and the mean NRMSEx values increased.
After filtering contaminated EMG using comb filter or GAAMF filter, correlation coefficients, SNRy , and NRMSEy were
calculated to evaluate the performance of the filters. As can be
seen in Fig. 6, both the filters presented good performance with
different ratios of FES artifact and clean EMG. After filtering
the EMG signal using the comb filter, correlation coefficients
between clean EMG and filtered EMG ranged from 0.86 to 0.80,
SNRy of the filtered EMG from 5.78 to 4.55 dB, and NRMSEy
between clean EMG and filtered EMG from 0.51 to 0.59 for different artifact-to-EMG ratios. After filtering the EMG signal using GA-AMF filter, the ranges of correlation coefficients, SNRy ,
and NRMSEy were 0.89 to 0.83, 6.94 to −5.06 dB, and 0.45
to 0.56, respectively. Fig. 6 illustrates the comparatives performances of the two filters when the ratio of FES artifact to clean
EMG varies. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance

GA-AMF filter) and the stimulus artifact to clean EMG ratio
(six levels: 0.3, 0.5, 1, 1.3, 1.5, 2) was applied with dependent
variables of correlation coefficient, SNRy , and NRMSEy , respectively. The results revealed no interaction between the type
of filter and the FES artifact to clean EMG ratio. But, the type
of filter showed a significant effect on all the three dependent
variables that measure filter performance [correlation coefficient: F (1, 6) = 41.006, p < 0.005; SNRy : F (1, 6) = 39.157,
p < 0.005; NRMSEy : F (1, 6) = 40.026, p < 0.005]. The performance of GA-AMF filter was better than that of comb filter, as indicated by the above three dependent variables. The
effect of the ratio of FES artifact to clean EMG was also significant [correlation coefficient: F (1, 6) = 53.431, p < 0.001;
SNRy : F (1, 6) = 50.265, p < 0.001; NRMSEy : F (1, 6) =
52.944, p < 0.001]. Pairwise comparison showed significant
difference between all pairs of ratios, excepting the following
two pairs: 0.3 and 1, 0.5 and 1.

C. GA-AMF Versus Fixed Parameters AMF
The filtering method (i.e., GA-AMF) proposed here has the
advantage of fast convergence rate; approximately 50 iterations
need to be run until GA-AMF converges, which takes about 39 s
on a regular personal computer. To improve processing speed in
practical applications, the optimized parameters of AMF found
in contaminated EMG with ratio 1 through GA were assigned
to AMF, which are called fixed parameters AMF. We attempted
to assess the difference between the GA-AFM and fixed parameters AMF when the artifact to EMG ratio varied (see Fig. 7).
For the ratios of 0.3, 0.5, 1.3 and 1.5, the relative errors of the
three performance parameters (correlation coefficients, SNRy ,
and NRMSEy ) of the two filters did not show significant difference, but they showed significant differences when the ratio
reached 2. These results suggest that fixed parameters AMF
could be applied for removing FES artifact from contaminated
EMG, when the FES artifact to clean EMG ratio was below 2.

D. Application in Processing Real EMG
Taking one subject as an example, Figs. 8 and 9 show the
filtering performances when a constant stimulation of 60 mA
was applied to generate slight knee joint motion. For RF, it is
clear that GA-AMF eliminated more FES artifact than did the
comb filter. For GM, GA-AMF and comb filter showed a similar
filtering effect. PR values for the 3 s real contaminated EMG
of the seven subjects are summarized in Table V. PR values of
GA-AMF filter are significantly higher than those of comb filter

for both RF and GM, indicating that GA-AMF filter performed
better.
IV. DISCUSSION
The present study applied GA-AMF filter to remove FES artifact from the contaminated EMG and evaluated its performance
on both simulation and real data. The artifact was assumed to
have been caused by current conduction through muscle tissues, and its shape was similar in each stimulation level. With
the presence of FES artifact, the recorded EMG was assumed to
have become a linear combination of the voluntary EMG and the
FES artifact. The GA-AMF filter was designed to remove FES
artifact and preserve voluntary EMG. The filter was designed,
based on AMF and showed good performance.
Compared with the performance of previous methods of artifact removal, the performance of GA-AMF was found to be
superior. For FES artifact removal, a two stage peak-detection
algorithm was previously proposed, but it was effective only
when M-wave and the artifact spike did not overlap [31]. In
contrast, the GA-AMF, which is based on scaling estimated
artifact to match the artifact optimally, provided a better way
of extracting voluntary EMG. Sample-and-interpolate artifact
removal technique was also previously developed to minimize
distortion in the action potential waveform [15], but it requires
identification of duration and shape of the stimulation artifact.
Besides, the FES artifact duration always remained shorter than
the latency of the neural response under investigation [15]. However, such limitation does not apply to GA-AMF as it does not
have to identify the shape or duration of artifact.
The GA-AMF filter was tested with simulated contaminated
EMG and real contaminated EMG signals and demonstrated to
be capable of removing FES artifact. Even most of FES artifact
can be removed using either comb or GA-AMF filter (see Figs.
3 and 4). GA-AMF filter showed better filtering effect than did
comb filter, as indicated by correlation coefficients, SNRy , and
NRMSEy (see Tables I–III). More importantly, GA-AMF holds
promise in eliminating FES artifact from the EMGs of both RF
and GM (see Figs. 8 and 9). Although PR is not a direct measurement of filter performance in processing real data, it could
at least indicate and evaluate the extent of removing FES artifact. Also, it was found that GA-AMF filter removed more FES
artifact than did the comb filter (see Table V). Compared with
comb filter, which attenuates only the input signal at regularly
spaced frequency intervals, GA-AMF performs better than does
the comb filter in eliminating FES artifact, with the added advantage of applying estimated FES artifact templates to match
FES artifact in the input signal optimally to remove as much
FES artifact as possible from the contaminated EMG.

QIU et al.: STIMULUS ARTIFACT REMOVAL TECHNIQUE FOR SEMG SIGNAL PROCESSING DURING FES

The filtering effect of GA-AMF on contaminated EMG was
tested on six ratios of FES artifact-to-EMG. The filtering performance of both GA-AMF and comb filters decreased as the
artifact-to-EMG ratio increased (see Fig. 6). Hence, it follows
that the filtering performance depends on the degree of contamination of EMG by FES artifact. In other words, GA-AMF filter
performed better with less severely contaminated EMG. The
performance of GA-AMF filter did not differ significantly from
that of AMF filter with fixed parameters when the artifact-toEMG ratio was below 2 (see Fig. 7). This result supports the use
of AMF filter with fixed parameters to increase the processing
speed in removing FES artifact in real-time FES system. However, the fixed parameters are applicable to the fixed location of
the measuring EMG electrodes. If the electrodes or stimulation
electrodes are moved to a different location, the parameters will
have to be changed.
Our results show that GA-AMF was effective in removing
FES artifact for the stimulated muscle, as well as its adjacent
muscle (see Figs. 8 and 9). The contamination of EMG of GM
(an adjacent muscle of RF) was less severe than that of the
RF (the only muscle being stimulated for inducing knee joint
movement). EMG of the stimulated muscle, as also of its adjacent muscles, should be filtered to extract voluntary EMG
signals.
Indeed, the present study has several limitations: 1) GA-AMF
was designed with the assumption that the stimulation frequency
is constant, and it remains to be ascertained if the FES system can
be applied with varying frequencies; 2) we tested this method
only on healthy subjects, but it has to be tested on paralyzed
muscle, too.
V. CONCLUSION
The GA-AMF filter, with better performance than that of
comb filter, can effectively eliminate FES artifact, making the
filtered signal similar to volitional EMG. To conclude, it can be
said that the present study provided an optimal way to extract
weak volitional EMG, collected from a stimulated muscle and
its adjacent muscles. This would be of great help in investigating
muscle fatigue, controlling stimulation intensity, and removing
electrical stimulation artifact from electroencephalogram.
