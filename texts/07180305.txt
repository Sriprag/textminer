Abstract—The results of the isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusion (IIGI) study need to mimic the dynamic glucose profiles during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to accurately calculate
the incretin effect. The glucose infusion rates during IIGI studies
have historically been determined by experienced research personnel using the manual ad-hoc method. In this study, a computational
method was developed to automatically determine the infusion
rates for IIGI study based on a glucose-dynamics model. To evaluate the computational method, 18 subjects with normal glucose tolerance underwent a 75 g OGTT. One-week later, Group 1 (n = 9)
and Group 2 (n = 9) underwent IIGI studies using the ad-hoc
method and the computational method, respectively. Both methods
were evaluated using correlation coefficient, mean absolute relative difference (MARD), and root mean square error (RMSE) between the glucose profiles from the OGTT and the IIGI study. The
computational method exhibited significantly higher correlation
(0.95 ± 0.03 versus 0.86 ± 0.10, P = 0.019), lower MARD
(8.72 ± 1.83% versus 13.11 ± 3.66%, P = 0.002), and lower
RMSE (10.33 ± 1.99 mg/dL versus 16.84 ± 4.43 mg/dL, P =
0.002) than the ad-hoc method. The computational method can
facilitate IIGI study, and enhance its accuracy and stability. Using this computational method, a high-quality IIGI study can be
accomplished without the need for experienced personnel.
Index Terms—Computational method, intravenous glucose infusion, isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusion (IIGI) study, normal
glucose tolerance (NGT), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

incretin hormones [1], and these hormones are secreted through
the intestine in response to nutrient absorption, thereby inducing
insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucosedependent manner [2]–[4]. Incretin hormones are important regulators of glucose-insulin metabolism in subjects with normal
glucose tolerance (NGT), as well as in subjects with diabetes
mellitus [5]. The concept of the incretin effect can explain the
enigmatic observation that an oral glucose load elicits more insulin secretion than a corresponding isoglycemic intravenous
glucose infusion (IIGI) study that reproduces the oral glucose
tolerance test’s (OGTT’s) plasma glucose profile [6]–[8]. The
incretin effect has been reported to have different aspects, depending on the glucose tolerance status [6], [7], [9]. Therefore,
the incretin effect must be considered in order to develop a
comprehensive understanding of incretin physiology [10].
The incretin effect is generally calculated using the difference
in the amounts of insulin secretion between an OGTT and the
corresponding IIGI study [6]–[8], [11]. Interestingly, the results
of the OGTT exhibit dynamic glucose profiles for subjects with
NGT [12]–[14], and therefore IIGI study should use intravenous
glucose to accurately replicate the specific glucose profile that is
produced during the OGTT. During IIGI study, the glucose infusion rates are determined using the manual ad-hoc method [11],
[15]–[20] by regularly evaluating the difference between the
current and target glucose levels. However, as there is no standardized method to determine the glucose infusion rate, the imprecise nature of IIGI requires the experience of a highly trained
research personnel to obtain accurate isoglycemic profiles.
Mathematical models can be used to predict the physiological response to plasma glucose levels [21]–[24], and numerous
models have been developed to use incretin hormone-related
parameters to describe glucose dynamics during an OGTT [25],
[26]. One of these models evaluated the physiological response
of incretin hormones to 50 g and 100 g oral glucose loads, although it was only tested under normal conditions in healthy
subjects [27]. A modified version of this model evaluates the
response in terms of glucose absorption and insulin potentiation
[14], and another model has focused on describing gastric emptying and the transport and absorption of oral glucose (75 g)
from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract into the portal blood using
incretin kinetics among subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus
or NGT [26]. Although these models have described the relationships between incretin hormones, insulin, and the rate of
the gastric emptying, they have only focused on a physiological description of glucose dynamics after oral glucose load,

and have not evaluated intravenous glucose infusion. Therefore,
the application of these current models in IIGI study may be
limited. In this study, we present a computational method that
extends the previous mathematical model for IIGI simulation
(using OGTT) [28] to a computer program, and have used this
program to determine the intravenous glucose infusion rates for
IIGI study.
II. METHODS
A. Subjects and Ethical Statement
Eighteen subjects (14 males and 4 females) with NGT participated in this study. None of the participants were receiving
medication or had known health conditions (e.g., heart, liver, or
kidney disease). Subjects were excluded if they were <18 years
or >75 years and had a past history of systemic diseases including diabetes. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital
(H-1011-086-341 and C-1108-122-375) and was conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave their informed consent prior to any study-related
procedures.
B. Experimental Methods
The 18 subjects were divided into two equal groups (Group
1 and Group 2, both n = 9), according to the method that was
used to adjust the glucose infusion rate (computation or ad-hoc).
The subjects in both groups were tested in the morning after an
overnight fast (>10 h), and each subject was provided with a 3 h75 g oral dose of glucose (the OGTT). At least one week later, an
IIGI study was performed to duplicate the plasma glucose profile that was observed during the corresponding OGTT. Group
1 underwent the 75 g OGTT and IIGI study using the ad-hoc
method, which was conducted by a research nurse who was thoroughly trained in the ad-hoc method. Group 2 underwent the 75 g
OGTT and IIGI study using the computational method, which

GUI of the program that was used in the computational method. After the subject number (subject #17 corresponds to subject #6 in Group 2) is selected from
the previous OGTT results, the glucose profile from the OGTT is loaded into
the table on the left. Once the current time and blood glucose level is entered
into the white input fields, the calculated values are displayed in the green box
after clicking the CALCULATE button, and the calculated data are also transferred to the left table. The RESET button is used to restart the computational
method. The SAVE button then exports the table on the left into a Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet. The user can monitor the graph during the IIGI study, and

OGTT, respectively.

was performed by the same research nurse who conducted the
ad-hoc method. The schema for this study is presented in Fig. 1.
The detailed processes for determining the glucose infusion
rates in the two methods are illustrated in Fig. 2(a). For the IIGI
study using the computational method, a graphical user interface
(GUI) was developed to display the calculated glucose infusion
rates on a personal computer [see Fig. 2(b)]. After loading the
subject’s previous OGTT glucose profile, the program determines a personalized set of parameters for the IIGI study. The
user then monitors the current blood glucose levels and inputs
the values into the program every 5 min for the first 2 h and every
20 min for the final hour (3 h). Based on this mechanism, the
program immediately provides an updated intravenous glucose
infusion rate.
The 20% dextrose was intravenously infused via an infusion
pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) in accordance

with the computed intravenous glucose infusion rate in both
methods during the IIGI study. For both OGTT and the IIGI
study, an intravenous catheter was placed in the subject’s antecubital vein for blood sampling. For the IIGI study, another
intravenous catheter was placed in the basilar or antecubital vein
of the contralateral arm for the glucose infusion. To measure the
plasma glucose concentration, approximately 0.5 mL of blood
was drawn every 5 min during the first 2 h, and then every 20 min
for the final hour. Plasma glucose concentrations were determined using the standard glucose oxidase method (YSI 2300
STAT plus analyzer, YSI, Inc., Yellow Springs, OH, USA), and
the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value was measured using a
COBAS Integra 800 analyzer (Roche, Switzerland).
C. Mathematical Model
A mathematical model of glucose dynamics, including the
incretin concept, was proposed by Brubaker et al. [27], and this
model is used to simulate the response to a 50 or 100 g oral
glucose load. In our earlier study [28], that model was modified
to evaluate changes in plasma glucose, insulin, and incretin
hormones in response to a 75 g oral dose of glucose.
This modified mathematical model consists of three ordinary
differential equations that represent the changes in plasma glucose, insulin, and the incretin hormones during the OGTT, as
well as three additional equations that represent the absorption of glucose from the GI tract and the glucose balance in
the liver

These equations describe the delivery of glucose to the duodenum (DuodG ; mmol/min), which in turn determines the rate
of incretin hormone secretion and the rate of glucose absorption into the mesenteric circulation (RaGut G ; mmol/min), which
subsequently determines the changes in blood glucose kinetics.
For the IIGI study, (1)–(4) were set to zero, and the equations for
the GI tract [27] were modified in proportion to a 75 g glucose
load (1) and (3).

The hepatic glucose balance (HepbalG ; mmol/min) reflects
the sum of glucose production in the liver and glucose uptake
from the mesenteric circulation (5) as shown at the bottom of
the page. HepbalG B (mmol/min) is the basal hepatic glucose
balance in the fasting state [27], and M (L2 /mU/min) represents
the effects of the counter-regulatory factors on the hepatic glucose balance. GB (mmol/L) is the basal glucose level, according
to the measured fasting plasma glucose level for each subject,
and parameter α (mmol2 · mU/L/min) represents the hepatic
regulatory term for hyperinsulinemia. IB (mU/L) is the basal insulin level that was determined using the average fasting plasma
insulin levels from all subjects (5) as shown at the bottom of the
page

Parameter V (L) is 20% of each subject’s body weight, while
k1 (L0.3 /mmol0.3 /min) and k2 (mmol/min/mU) represent the
non-insulin-mediated and insulin-mediated glucose uptake, respectively. The derivative control of insulin on glucose is described by the parameter γ. GI V (mL/min) represents the intravenous glucose infusion rate for the IIGI study. The term with
GI V was added to represent the intravenous infused glucose
that was used in the simulation for the IIGI study, although it
was not used for the OGTT. GI V is calculated to minimize
the difference between the target glucose level (measured at
the OGTT) and the predicted glucose level. The range of the
infusion rate is assumed to be between 0 and 4.0 mL/min. Parameter k10 (mmol/mL) is the correction factor for describing
the plasma glucose response to the infused intravenous glucose,
and the initial value is set to 10. Parameters k3 (L/min) and k4
(mmol/min) represent the slope and intercept of renal glucose
clearance, respectively.

estimation in this study. Parameter k9 (min−1 ) is the insulin
clearance rate, and β (mU/L/min) is the effect of the additional
regulators. In the IIGI study, the insulin secretion that is induced
by incretin is simulated to be much lower than the secretion in
the simulated OGTT.

RaInc (ng/min) is the basal appearance rate of incretin, IncB
(ng/L) is the basal incretin concentration that was determined
using the average fasting total GIP for all study subjects, and k6
(min−1 ) is the degradation of Inc. Parameter k5 (ng/L/mmol) is
the appearance rate of incretin due to DuodG , which was determined using parameter estimation in the current study. In the
IIGI study, the appearance rate of Inc is essentially unchanged,
as the rate is mainly affected by DuodG .
The model was implemented using MATLAB R2012a (Mathworks, Inc., MA, USA), and the solutions to the differential
equations were obtained using the “ode45” function, which is
based on the 4–5th order Runge–Kutta methods.
D. Parameter Estimation
Among the 15 parameters in the model, the five patientspecific parameters (k5 , k7 , k8 , k10 , and M) were estimated
based on the measured OGTT data and the other parameters’
values were fixed and taken from Brubaker et al. [27]. The
estimation was conducted within a reasonable range to provide nonzero glucose and insulin levels, while also covering
the parameter distribution. The values of the parameters in the
OGTT model were estimated to minimize the weighted sum of
the squares of the residuals between the measurements and the
simulated results of the OGTT [26], [29], [30].
The k10 parameter (correction factor for describing the
plasma glucose response to the infused intravenous glucose)
was estimated using another method, which compares the difference between the predicted glucose level and the current
glucose value after the glucose infusion. The adjustment of k10
can be described as follows:

where k10,I is the ith k10 value. Before starting the IIGI study,
the initial k10 value was set to 10 and adjusted during the first
four repetitions (i.e., a time-variant model parameter). As the
plasma glucose response to intravenously infused glucose is
continually changing, the averaged k10 value from the previous
process and the newly calculated current value are reflected in
the model to determine the next glucose infusion rate. After repeating this process four times, the fifth k10 value is defined as
the fourth value and is maintained to be maintained throughout

7

the IIGI study. The results of the parameter estimation were obtained using the “patternsearch” function (a built-in MATLAB
function), which is based on the pattern search method that is
used for optimization techniques.
E. Performance Evaluation Analysis
The performance of the two methods was evaluated using
the correlation coefficient (r), root mean squared error (RMSE),
and the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) [31], [32].
The term “r” represents the degree of linear correlation between the glucose levels from the OGTT (GOGTT ) and the IIGI
study (GIIGI ). The accuracy of each method was measured using
RMSE and MARD, which were defined as follows:

(11)
RMSE =
N


1 N  GOGTT − GIIGI 
MARD =
 · 100 (12)
i=1 
N
GOGTT
where N represents the number of measured plasma glucose
data, and GOGTT and GIIGI represent the plasma glucose data
during the OGTT and the IIGI study, respectively. The RMSE
was used to evaluate the accuracy which gives more weight to
high glucose values because it involves squaring the difference
between GOGTT and GIIGI [31]. However, MARD was used to
provide a relative error because it gives an appropriate weight
to all magnitudes of GIIGI [32]. In this study, desired accuracy
of IIGI study was set to <10%.
F. Statistical Analysis
The statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism 5.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The Mann–Whitney test
was used to compare continuous variables. Spearman’s correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the association between
the measured glucose levels from the OGTT and the IIGI study.
Intergroup differences were considered significant at a P-value
of <0.05.
III. RESULTS
No technological or clinical problems were encountered during the testing of both groups. The clinical characteristics of the
study subjects are listed in Table I. No statistically significant
differences were observed between the two groups, except for
HbA1c. In addition, the plasma glucose levels during the 75 g
OGTT (e.g., fasting, peak, and 2 h postload plasma glucose)
were similar for both groups. Four patient-specific parameters
(k5 , k7 , k8 , and M) for each personalized model were estimated
using the subject’s glucose profile from the OGTT, and k10 was
estimated using the plasma glucose response to the intravenous
glucose. The parameter estimation results from Group 2 are
summarized in Table II.
The comparison between the computational and ad-hoc methods is shown in Figs. 3 and 4 and Table III. Fig. 3 represents
changes in glucose profiles during the OGTT and the IIGI study
and glucose infusion rate between Group 1 (IIGI study using the
ad-hoc method) and Group 2 (IIGI study using the computation

method). Although the amounts of total administered glucose
during the IIGI study were different (2.6 ± 0.8 g for Group 1
versus 3.9 ± 0.9 g for Group 2, P = 0.002), the areas under
the plasma glucose curve during IIGI study were not different between the two groups (23.1 ± 2.1 g·min/dL for Group 1
versus 22.1 ± 2.1 g·min/dL for Group 2, P = 0.251). During
IIGI study using the computational method, the plasma glucose
concentrations exhibited more similar to the profiles from the
OGTT, compared to those during IIGI study using the ad-hoc
method (see Fig. 3). In addition, the changes in Group 2’s glucose infusion rate were more stable, compared to those in Group
1 (see Fig. 3). However, the maximum infusion rates were not
significantly different (1.7 ± 0.7 mL/min for Group 1 versus 1.6
± 0.4 mL/min for Group 2, P = 0.930).

corresponding IIGI study (line with circles). The glucose infusion rates during
the IIGI study are indicated in the lower panels. Group 1 subjects underwent
the IIGI study using the ad-hoc method (a) with the smallest error (root mean
square error (RMSE) = 9.76 mg/dL), and (b) with the largest error (RMSE =
24.50 mg/dL). Group 2 subjects underwent the IIGI study using the computational method (c) with the smallest error (RMSE = 7.36 mg/dL), and (d) with
the largest error (RMSE = 13.74 mg/dL).

Table III shows performance outcomes of IIGI study using
the computational and ad-hoc methods. The correlation (r) with
Group 2 was higher than the correlation with Group 1. The
MARD of Group 2 was <10%, which satisfies our desired accuracy for the IIGI study, although the MARD of Group 1 was

IV. DISCUSSION
In our previous study [28], the glucose-insulin profiles during
IIGI study were successfully predicted using the parameters of
the personalized OGTT model. In addition, the simulation study
demonstrated that the mathematical model could predict glucose
and insulin levels in the acceptable range during OGTT and IIGI
study [28]. In the present study, we developed the computational
method to automatically calculate the glucose infusion rate for
IIGI study. The developed computational method generated a
higher correlation coefficient (versus the ad-hoc method) between the glucose levels from the OGTT and the IIGI study,
as well as lower MARD and RMSE (see Table III). These results indicate that the computational method is more suitable for
reproducing the isoglycemic profiles during IIGI study.
The mathematical model used in the computational method
was based on the glucose–insulin response to the OGTT, which
is reflected in the individual’s estimated parameter set. For
example, the estimated values of M (effects of the counterregulatory factors on the liver) in subjects #5 and #7 were 4.00
and 3.60 L2 /mU/min, respectively, which are higher than the
mean value (1.90 ± 1.14 L2 /mU/min, Table II). In contrast, the
ranges of the plasma glucose levels during the OGTT in subjects #5 and #7 were 70.0 and 80.6 mg/dL, respectively, which
are lower than the mean value (107.5 ± 28.1 mg/dL, Table I).
Furthermore, the estimated values of M were negatively correlated with the range of plasma glucose levels during the OGTT
(r = −0.86, P = 0.005) in total subjects. This indicates that
hepatic gluconeogenesis was physiologically suppressed when
plasma glucose excursion is increased.
To develop the mathematical model for IIGI study using
computational method, we integrated an equation that describes
intravenous glucose administration into the model for the OGTT.
Actually, the glucose levels in the real subjects increased or decreased after glucose infusion, whereas the glucose levels from
the model responded linearly in proportional to the change in
the glucose infusion rate. For example, if the glucose infusion
rate is 0.6 mL/min or less, the glucose levels in real subjects
did not change or gradually decreased. In contrast, the glucose
levels from the model were not decreased due to the effect of the
infused glucose. Therefore, k10 was adjusted to compensate for
the unique plasma glucose responses to the intravenous glucose.

9

The initial value of k10 was set to 10, which is acceptable because the estimated value of k10 was 9.25 ± 3.06 mmol/mL in
our previous study [28], where we used this model to examine
the effects of glucose infusion rate on the change of plasma
glucose concentration for individual subjects. In addition,
because the glucose response is affected by both the plasma
insulin concentration and the volume of intravenously infused
glucose [13], the k10 adjustment was performed at the beginning of the IIGI study, before the insulin secretion had increased above the basal level (due to the rapid increase in plasma
glucose).
Although all of the subjects in both groups had NGT, a wide
variety of glucose profile peaks and shapes were observed during the OGTT (see Fig. 4). For example, several subjects had
a bimodal response during the OGTT as shown in Fig. 4(a)–
(c). However, the OGTT model is used to determine the next
predicted glucose level, which in turn is used to determine the
glucose infusion rate. Therefore, the proposed computational
method can provide accurate IIGI study even if the glucose
profiles exhibit a bimodal response with low goodness of fit
between the simulated and clinical glucose profiles during the
OGTT. This fact has been confirmed in a previous study [28],
where simulated OGTT data exhibited low correlation with the
corresponding experimental OGTT data, although the simulated
glucose data reflected the actual glucose infusion rate and exhibited a relatively high correlation with the corresponding experimental IIGI data. However, previous studies have reported that
subjects with a bimodal response during OGTT exhibited higher
insulin sensitivity and preserved beta cell function [33], [34].
Therefore, the incorporation of additional parameters, which
characterize the pattern of the glucose curve (e.g., insulin sensitivity and beta cell function) is required, which might provide
a better prediction of the glucose profiles during IIGI study.
Our computational method is the first to accurately reproduce
isoglycemic profiles during IIGI study, and this method is more
accurate, with lower errors, than the manual ad-hoc method.
Therefore, this method can facilitate IIGI study, and enhance
its accuracy and stability. Using this method, any researcher
can perform high-quality IIGI study, without the need for an
experienced clinician or nurse. Further studies are needed for the
computational method to be applied to subjects with abnormal
glucose tolerance such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, impaired
glucose tolerance, and impaired fasting glucose.
