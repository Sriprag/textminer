Serdar Murat Öztaner, Tuğba Taşkaya Temizel, S. Remzi Erdem, and Mahmut Özer

Abstract—The incorporation of pharmacogenomics information
into the drug dosing estimation formulations has been shown to increase the accuracy in drug dosing and decrease the frequency of
adverse drug effects in many studies in the literature. In this paper,
an estimation framework based on the Bayesian structural equation modeling, which is driven by pharmacogenomics, is proposed.
The results show that the model compares favorably with the linear models in terms of prediction and explaining the variations in
warfarin dosing.
Index Terms—Bayesian structural equation modeling, data mining, personalized medicine, pharmacogenomics.

I. INTRODUCTION
N IMPORTANT research challenge for patient safety is to
minimize adverse drug reactions [1]. Warfarin is a commonly used anticoagulant drug having a narrow therapeutic
window. The underdosing and overdosing of warfarin can be
disastrous due to the thrombotic or hemorrhagic adverse reactions, respectively. Since the initiation of warfarin therapy based
on clinical procedures is risky and problematic, various studies
have suggested warfarin dosing algorithms [2]–[7].
There is considerable individual variation in warfarin response and 17–25% of the variability in the therapeutic warfarin dose can be accounted for the clinical factors alone [5],
[8]–[11]. It was stated that 52–54% [5], [6], [8], [11] or about
55% [2], [12] of the variability could be explained for some
ethnic groups by including the polymorphisms of genes coding
the enzymes CYP2C9 and VKORC1 and using various pharmacogenomics algorithms based on stepwise linear regression
[2]–[11]. Most of these pharmacogenomics algorithms made use
of both nongenetic factors [body surface area (BSA), age, race,
target-international normalized ratio (INR), amiodarone in-take,
smoking status, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)] [10], [13]–[20], and well-known warfarin related
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as CYP2C9∗ 2
(rs1799853), CYP2C∗ 3 (rs1057910), VKORC1:−1639G>A

(rs9923231) and VKORC1: 1173C>T (rs9934438) [10], [21]–
[33].
A recent study which was conducted by Özer et al. [3]
on a group of Turkish patients deduced a linear regression
model including CYP2C9∗ 2, CYP2C9∗ 3, VKORC1 −1639, and
CYP4F2 (rs2108622) variants, as well as age, which explained
39.3% of the overall interindividual differences in the warfarin
dose.
This study aims to improve the accuracy and efficacy of the
warfarin dosing by using advanced methods of data mining
and data estimation. A novel framework based on the Bayesian
structural equation modeling (SEM) is proposed for warfarin
dosing. The proposed framework performs better than the stateof-the-art methods, which make use of linear regression such
as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Additional genetic
(VKORC1:1173C>T, CYP4F2) and nongenetic factors (concomitant medication, comorbidities) are also incorporated into
the proposed model to improve the accuracy of pharmacogenomics driven prediction. Two independent datasets were used
in the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium
(IWPC [12]–[14], Turkish [3]) in this study.

II. GENETIC FACTORS OF WARFARIN DOSING
The polymorphisms of two genes that code the enzymes
CYP2C9 and VKORC1 account for ࣈ40% (ࣈ15% and 25%,
respectively) of the dose variations [32]. The most accountable
SNPs of CYP2C9 are the ∗ 2 and ∗ 3 polymorphisms, which are
associated with lower dose of warfarin [10], [13], [26], [27].
When compared to homozygous wild-type patients, 15–20%
and 30–40% lower daily maintenance doses are required by patients heterozygous for CYP2C9∗ 2 and .patients heterozygous
for CYP2C9∗ 3, respectively [13], [26].
The variations of VKORC1 are very effective for warfarin
dosing. Several studies have shown that VKORC1:−1639G>A
and VKORC1: 1173C>T are aligned with significantly lower
warfarin dose requirements [10], [13], [21], [29]–[33]. Two variants are almost equally predictive for warfarin dosing, since
VKORC1: 1173C>T is in near perfect linkage disequilibrium
with VKORC1:−1639G>A [33]. Individuals who carry the A
allele in VKORC1:−1639G>A require a 28% decrease in the
therapeutic warfarin dose per allele [29]–[33].
The variant of CYP4F2 (rs2108622) has also been indicated
to affect the warfarin related enzyme activity (4–12% increase
in the warfarin dose per T allele) [25], [31], [34]. A recent study

on Turkish population has also shown that CYP4F2 accounts
for 2.8% of the variation in warfarin dosing per T allele [3].
III. METHODS
A. Data
Two independent datasets were used for this study: 1) the
combined multiethnic dataset and 2) the Turkish dataset.
The Warfarin Consortium Combined Dataset provided by the
IWPC was used [14]. The IWPC dataset and the metadata are
available at the website of the Pharmacogenomics knowledge
base (PharmGKB) [14].
The IWPC dataset consists of 5700 subjects and 68 features
(due to preprocessing). The feature set was initially preprocessed and reduced to 24 features based on the properties of
the dataset, the suggestions of the domain experts, and the prior
knowledge extracted from the literature.
The Turkish dataset contains 107 Turkish patients who were
enrolled at the Department of Cardiology and Cardiovascular
Surgery of Kartal Koşuyolu Education and Research Hospital
between April 2009 and January 2010 [3]. The patients were
selected among 263 individuals who had been using warfarin
for at least 4 months and whose last three INR measurements
for the stable daily dose were within the therapeutic range (2
to 3). The mean daily warfarin dose was reported as 5.16 ±
1.95 mg (range 1.43–10.00 mg). The total set of 22 features were
processed and reduced to 8 features. The descriptive statistics
of the main features from IWPC and Turkish datasets that could
be used in the Bayesian SEM are provided in Table I.
B. Steps Followed
The proposed framework uses a Bayesian SEM approach to
improve the accuracy and efficacy of warfarin dosing while
using the proper subset of genetic and nongenetic features provided in IWPC and Turkish datasets [35], [36]. An iterative
method was applied until the best fitted model was obtained,
which involved several steps of data preprocessing, data analysis, model construction, Bayesian inference, testing, and validation (see Fig. 1).
C. Data Processing
Data analysis and processing methods were thoroughly applied for the IWPC dataset [37], [38]. The IWPC dataset originally contains 5700 subjects. Within the scope of this study, the
subjects who had been marked as patients that reached a stable
dose of warfarin (provided as a feature in the dataset) and had
an INR of 2 to 3 were selected.
Some genetic and nongenetic features such as VKORC1
1542, VKORC1 4451, and taking azoles were not utilized in the
model because of the high percentage of missing rows. Some
new features were derived from original features of the dataset.
For instance, the comorbidities features of the original dataset,
which had been expressed as a list of diseases, were converted
into a set of new binary features that correspond to cooccurring
diseases (cancer, diabetes, cardiac failures, valve replacement).
Similar processing was performed for the features related with

1725

indications. Some of the features related with medications and
herbal and nutritional intakes were left for future studies.
The type of the selected features is continuous, binary, or
categorical. The therapeutic dose of warfarin was also normalized using the log function. Since the nonsynonymous SNPs
in CYP2C9 (∗ 2 and ∗ 3) are both aligned with reduced enzyme
activity, they were treated as separate categorical factors. The
genotypes of CYP2C9∗ 2 (∗ 1/∗ 1, ∗ 1/∗ 2, ∗ 2/∗ 2) were coded as a
categorical factor having values 1 (wild), 2 (heterozygote), and
3 (mutant), respectively. Similarly, the genotypes of CYP2C9∗ 3
(∗ 1/∗ 1, ∗ 1/∗ 3, ∗ 3/∗ 3) were coded as 1 (wild), 2 (heterozygote),
and 3 (mutant). The individuals having both of the CYP2C9∗ 2
and CYP2C9∗ 3 mutations (∗ 2/∗ 3) were accepted as mutant.
The genotypes of VKORC1 −1639G>A (A/A, A/G, G/G)
were coded as a categorical factor having values 1 (mutant),
2 (heterozygote), and 3 (wild). Similarly, VKORC1 1173C>T
(T/T, T/C, C/C) were coded as a categorical factor having values
1 (mutant), 2 (heterozygote), and 3 (wild).
The summary of missing value analyses and corresponding
frequencies (see Table I) demonstrated that the percent missing
ranged from 0.4% to 94% with respect to the factor. Different approaches were followed according to the percent of data
missing [37]–[39]. Therefore, 17 rows of race and 33 rows of
age were listwise deleted, and eventually 4473 rows are left for
further data analyses and modeling. For factors having more
than 5% and less than 50% missing, the multiple imputation
technique was used accordingly. Factors (cancer 94,0%, fluvastatin 53,1%, rifampin 53,1%, fluconazole 53,0%, lovastatin
52,9%) having more than 50% missing values are excluded from
the study because multiple imputation performs very poorly in
these cases.
SPSS statistics makes use of a fully conditional specification
method based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for multiple imputation [39], [40]. The missing patterns
of the dataset were analyzed. The features such as cancer having a high percentage of missing values were excluded from the
study. For the rest of the independent features which were binary
variables, multiple imputation was performed using logistic regression on the recoded dataset. The number of imputations was
set to 5. The number of between-imputation iterations was assigned to 200 (a dataset was saved every 200th iteration). In order
to assess the accuracy of the imputations, some of the original
data were randomly deleted, multiple imputation was carried
out, and the imputed values were compared to the actual values.
The comparison was made for randomly selected 100 cases and
the proportion of the imputed categories that matched the true
categories was calculated. The comparison results showed that
the imputations were 96% accurate.
Factors were excluded from analysis for several reasons other
than being missing. For instance, race was discarded due to
two main reasons: 1) Multicollinearity: Race was shown to be
strongly correlated with the genetic factors in IWPC dataset.
2) Communization: Race was obviously not a factor in Turkish
dataset and two datasets needed to be communized for comparison purposes. Note that multicollinearity does not reduce the
reliability of the model or the overall predictive power but can
affect the results of the individual predictors. VKORC 1173C>T

was also extracted from the model because of multicollinearity.
The covariance analyses of VKORC1:−1639G>A and VKORC
1173C>T revealed that two genetic factors were highly correlated, which was also consistent with the fact that two mutations
were in near perfect linkage disequilibrium with each other.
Consequently, the feature selection was applied on the processed and imputed IWPC dataset to obtain the final set of features: Age, BSA, PE/DVT, Amiodarone, Smoking, CYP2C9∗ 2,

CYP2C9∗ 3, VKORC1 −1639G>A, Target-INR, and Warfarin
Dose (see Table II, Model 1). The data used in modeling consisted of 4473 rows and 10 features. 1491 subjects were randomly selected to form the validation cohort. The remaining
2982 rows were used as the training cohort for the IWPC dataset.
Turkish dataset had no missing values for the features that
were included in this study. Note that the similar features
used for IWPC were also utilized for the Turkish dataset: Age,

cohorts as well: Training cohort (72 patients) and validation
cohort (35 patients).
D. Bayesian SEM
SEM was used as the modeling and estimation framework,
since it covers a broad range of approaches from linear regression to Bayesian inference including the confirmatory factor
analysis [35]–[43]. Bayesian approach which allows nonlinearity, missing data, and various types of observed variables (mixed
categorical, binary, and continuous) was preferred to other approaches due to its flexibility and strength in estimation and
analysis for SEM frameworks [35], [36]. Bayesian SEM, therefore, was considered to be the most convenient approach for the
complex warfarin dosing problem that contains several types of
covariates and missing data [44]–[49].

The initial hypothetical structural equation model for warfarin dosing initially consisted of 24 observed variables—two
of them are dependent observed variables Y1 and Y2—is expressed in LISREL notation (see Fig. 2). However, the models
were constructed according to the factors existed in the corresponding dataset. For instance, while the model for Turkish
dataset included CYP4F2, the model for IWPC dataset did not
take CYP4F2 into account. Therefore, the final (recognized as
the best fitted model according to the goodness-of-fit tests for
a set of factors) model was named after the subset of factors
incorporated from the corresponding IWPC or Turkish datasets
(see Table II). Bayesian estimation and analysis were applied
separately for each of the models involving several steps: 1)
Creating the model, 2) specifying the data, 3) specifying the
model and drawing variables, 4) constraining parameters, 5) selecting prior distributions and the admissibility test, 6) defining
analysis properties (burn-in, bootstrap), 7) estimating explicit
means and intercepts, 8) testing for convergence, and 9) model
selection based on the model fit. The graphical representation

Structures (AMOS) is provided (see Fig. 3).
IV. RESULTS
IBM SPSS AMOS v21 software was utilized for the application of Bayesian SEM analysis and inference based on the
MCMC [50]. AMOS, by default, uses an uninformative (diffuse
or vague) prior, which is a uniform distribution having a lower
bound of −3.4 × 10−38 and a upper bound 3.4 × 1038 (Arbuckle, 2013). The uniform priors on wider scale are improper
and because of that the posteriors can be improper. AMOS provides an Admissibility test, which automatically sets the prior
density to 0 for any parameter values that are improper for
priors [50]. In this study, the constraints on prior distributions
were set for variables on a parameter-by-parameter basis by
taking into account the previous studies [2]–[7], and elicited
information from the domain experts. Also note that, since a
communized set of factors were used for both the IWPC and
Turkish dataset, the same type prior of distributions with similar settings were applied for the corresponding models. The
prior distributions of the means of the coefficients of the exogenous observed (manifest) variables were set to a bounded
uniform distribution indicating the influence of the factor on the
warfarin dosing. For instance, age is indicated to be a factor
associated with a reduced dose of warfarin because the risk of
warfarin triggered bleedings increases with advancing age [10],
[18]. Thus, the mean of the coefficient of age was assigned to
uniform distribution having a lower bound of −1 and upper
bound of 0. On the other hand, BSA is associated with a higher
dose of warfarin and, therefore, the means of corresponding coefficients of BSA variables in Models 1 and 3 were assigned
to a uniform prior distribution having 0 as the lower bound
and 1 as the upper bound. Genetic factors such as VKORC1
−1639G>A, CYP2C9∗ 2, and CYP2C9∗ 3 are associated with

1729

lower dose requirements and the prior distribution of their coefficient means were assigned to a uniform distribution having −1
as the lower bound and 0 as the upper bound [2]–[7], [10], [18].
The SNPs of CYP4F2, which included in the Turkish dataset
[3], are indicated with a higher dose requirement, and thus, the
prior distribution of the corresponding coefficient mean was assigned to a uniform distribution having 0 as the lower bound
and 1 as the upper bound. These bounded uniform distributions are regarded as proper weakly informative priors (WIPs)
[35], [36]. All of the prior distributions of the variances of the
observed exogenous variable were assigned to WIPs with a uniform distribution having 0 as the lower bound and 3.4 × 1038
(AMOS default) as the upper bound. The improper priors were
reorganized using the admissibility test so as to avoid improper
posteriors.
A burn-in value of 1000 (default 500) and a refreshing interval
(default 1000) of 2000 were selected. The number of MCMC
iterations was set to 200 000. The built-in Gelman-Rubin diagnostic for convergence was used [51]–[53]. The specified models were by default accepted to have been converged when the
diagnostic values were less than 1.002.
In this study, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation
(RMSEA) and the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) were used to
test for model fit of a single model. For instance, the RMSEA
was calculated as 0.057 (values about 0.05 or less are accepted
as good fit) and the CFI was reported as 0.92 (a value of CFI
ࣙ 0.95 is recognized as an indication of good fit) for the best
fitted candidate model of the Model 3 [54]. For comparing two
nonnested models, the Browne–Cudeck criterion (BCC) and the
Akaike information criterion (AIC) value were utilized. Among
the candidate fitted models for the Model 3, the model with
the rescaled BCC value of 1.642 and the rescaled AIC value of
1.723 was selected [50].
The Models 1 and 2 were provided for a complete eligible set
of variables. The results of the corresponding stepwise regressions for the Models 1 and 2 were consistent with the referenced
linear dosing algorithms [2], [4], [55].
On the other hand, the Models 3 and 4 were established
for comparison and validation purposes. Exactly the same set
of features from entirely different datasets was modeled in a
similar fashion and Bayesian inference was performed.
MLE explained 38.1% to 46.3% of the variation (R2 ) in warfarin dose for the IWPC dataset using five factors (Model 3)
and ten factors (Model 1), respectively. On the other hand, MLE
could explain 44.5% of the variation (R2 ) in warfarin dose for
Turkish dataset using five factors (Model 4). The performances
of the linear regression algorithms were calculated as 45.1% and
49.3% for Models 3 and 4. For the same five factors, the proportion of variation explained (R2 ) by the corresponding linear
model was higher for the small Turkish dataset than the large
IWPC dataset. In addition to that, the linear model applied on
Model 4 also performed better than Model 3 supposedly owing
to the diverse ethnic population of the IWPC dataset and the data
size. The Bayesian estimation was initially applied for both of
the training cohorts utilizing the five common factors and the
resultant posterior estimates (mean and standard error) of the
best-fitted models were recorded (see Table III).

The results of Bayesian estimation applied for both IWPC (Model-3) and Turkish (Model-4) datasets for five common factors (CYP2C9∗ 2, CYP2C9∗ 3, and VKORC1 –1639G> A
are recoded to binary variables beforehand).

Based on the same genetic and nongenetic factors, Bayesian
estimation was indicated to explain the 44.6% (38.1% by MLE)
and 51.2% (44.5% by MLE) of the variation (R2 ) in dosing for
IWPC and Turkish datasets, respectively. Note that although the
Bayesian estimation improved the portion of the variance explained for both datasets, it was more successful for the Turkish
dataset for five factors (Model 4). The prediction performances
were also improved for both the datasets (47.4% and 51.7%
respectively) compared to MLE (45.1% and 49.3%). Bayesian
estimations were repeated for the randomly formed test cohorts
of the two datasets as well. The results obtained for the best
fitted models of each dataset were compared to the results obtained from training cohorts. It was concluded that the results
were statistically consistent in the 95% confidence interval (p =
0.0023).
Keeping the five dominant factors in the model, new factors
were separately introduced into Bayesian SEMs for each dataset
incrementally.
For model that includes the complete set of factors from
Turkish dataset (Model 2), VKORC1:−1639G>A was the most
dominant genetic feature and explained 27.2% of the variance
in warfarin dosing (Mutant: 19.8%, Hetero: 7.4%). The second
significant gene was CYP2C9. CYP2C9∗ 3 explained 13.2% of
the variance in maintenance dose, while CYP2C9∗ 2 explained
10.4%. CYP4F2 was associated with 3.2% of the variance. Nongenetic factors were also associated with warfarin dose. The factors age, BSA, and indications (PE/DVT, Cardiac Indications)
were also accounted for warfarin dose (2.8%, 1.2%, 0.7%).
Thus, model including eight factors from the Turkish dataset
could explain 56.7% of the variance.
As a second task, the model for IWPC dataset was also enriched with the new factors available. For IWPC dataset, BSA,
PE/DVT, amiodarone, target-INR, and smoking were incorporated (Model 1). The total variance explained for IWPC dataset
using Bayesian estimation was found to be 53.9%. We studied
the case when the genetic varıables were treated as continuous

variables on the IWPC dataset. (For CYP2C9, wild, heterozygous, and mutant genotypes were accepted as 0, 1, and 2, respectıvely). The results have shown that the percentage of the
variance explained dropped from 53.9% to 50.6%.
The assessment of the influence imposed on the posterior estimates by prior distributions is crucial to ensure that a proper
solution is obtained. The sensitivity of the prior assumptions was
evaluated by repeating the analysis under different prior assumptions and comparing the posterior results for each unknown. As
the size of a dataset grows, the evidence from the data eventually disregards the priori information, and the influence of the
prior distribution decreases. To verify this assumption, Bayesian
inference was reperformed after the prior distributions for the
subjected parameter were reset to AMOS default. For instance,
the priors of the coefficient of age were set to default and almost
the same mean and standard error estimates (−0.026 and 0.002)
were obtained indicating the sensitivity posteriors to priors is
low for Model 3. The same sensitivity check was also applied for
Model 4, and a small discrepancy was observed in the posterior
mean and standard error of age (−0.024 and 0.013), meaning
that priori information had relatively higher influence on the
posterior estimate.
V. DISCUSSION
For several reasons, warfarin is an ideal drug to test the hypothesis that pharmacogenomics can reduce drug toxicity: it
is commonly prescribed, has a narrow therapeutic/toxic ratio,
and is affected by common genetic polymorphisms. The results
of the pharmacogenomics studies caused the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) to update the warfarin drug label
to include information about genetic polymorphisms affecting
dosing in August 2007 [54]. The FDA modified the warfarin label, stating that VKORC1 and CYP2C9, Age, BSA, interacting
drugs, and indication for warfarin therapy explained about 55%
of the variability in warfarin dose in Caucasian patients. These

results were supported by the IWPC’s rather complicated equation which had been provided in the supplementary appendix
of Klein et al. [2], [13]. IWPC provides a dosing algorithm in
excel format based on this equation [56].
The previous studies which proposed pharmacogenomics
driven formulations for the prediction of warfarin dosage used
a model based on the linear regression [2]–[7]. Roper et al.
[8] conducted a comparative study to validate and compare the
three published warfarin dosing algorithms by Sconce et al. [4],
Anderson et al. [7], Klein et al. [2], and the Warfarin Dosing website [57] based on the studies of Gage et al. [5], [6].
The predicted dose requirements were compared with the actual maintenance dose for each patient within the therapeutic
INR of 2.0 to 3.0 [2]–[7], [58]. It was concluded that all linear
regression-based methods produced similar results explaining
only 37.7% to 45.8% of the variance in warfarin dosage in the
IWPC training dataset as indicated in Table IV [8]. It was also
shown that when comparing the percentage of patients whose
predicted dosage were within 20% of actual, the IWPC algorithm performed the best (45.9%) [2], [8], [12]–[14].
Bayesian SEM was also utilized without pharmacogenomics
variables based on the IWPC dataset. The model that included
BSA, Age, Amiodarone, Target-INR, DVT/PE as the factors
converged and explained the 21.7% of the variability in dosing. The results were consistent with the literature information
indicating that 17–25% of the variability in the therapeutic warfarin dose can be explained by using clinical factors alone [5],
[8]–[11]. Thus, Bayesian SEM can also be effectively used for
clinical factors alone.
It has been indicated that Bayesian SEM is a robust and effective approach for the estimation of warfarin dosing since it facilitates the exploration and identification of hidden relationships
and provides the flexibility to utilize useful prior information for
achieving better prediction results. Besides, Bayesian sampling
does not rely on asymptotic theory and thus give more reliable
results for small datasets (e.g., Turkish dataset).
However, the prior information and data should be dealt with
carefully so as to achieve reliable unbiased predictions. If there
is reliable background information, it will be reasonable to center the prior distributions for the mean and standard deviation
of the variables. By this way, each version of a model does not
start from the scratch, but all the information extracted from the
previous studies can be incorporated. In the absence of reliable
background information, noninformative priors are used. WIPs,
on the other hand, are utilized which make use of prior infor-

1731

mation for regularization and stabilization, providing enough
prior information to prevent results that contradict our knowledge or problems such as negative variance. The findings on the
assessment of prior sensitivity are consistent with the theoretical
assertion which states that small datasets are more sensitive to
the usage of informative priors and as the size of the sample
increases the effect of the priors diminishes [35], [36].
VI. CONCLUSION
Bayesian SEM better explains the variations in warfarin dosing and improves prediction of stable therapeutic dose of warfarin (compared to the one-size-fits-all 5 mg/day dose). Some of
the features related with warfarin dosing such as medications,
and herbal and nutritional intakes (vitamin K) are planned to be
studied as a future work.
The results indicated that the proposed framework better explained the variation in warfarin dosing and improved the prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The
proportion of variation explained (R2 ) was higher (44.6–56.7%)
depending on the dataset and the features included in the model.
The predicted dose was compared to the actual dose for each
patient to assess the performance of the dosing algorithm. The
proposed framework including five dominant factors performed
better than the IWPC algorithm (47.4% versus 45.1%) given that
the predicted doses were within 20% of the actual. The recent
similar studies [44]–[49], [59]–[62] also suggest that Bayesian
modeling and estimation can be a further step in the direction of
personalized medicine. Nevertheless, the future of personalized
warfarin dosing depends on the availability of easily applicable
and in-expensive genotyping methods.
