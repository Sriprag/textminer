Abstract—Defibrillators often use an ac measurement to ensure safe electrode placement. Some defibrillators also utilize
impedance measurements for ventilation monitoring. This paper
investigates how such measurements can be optimized for high respiration sensitivity and finds that it is beneficial to add two extra
electrodes in addition to the two defibrillator electrodes. This four
electrode setup increases sensitivity and also allows respiration
measurements at lower frequencies than the two electrode setup.
Index Terms—Bioimpedance, defibrillator, respiration, sensitivity, ventilation.

I. INTRODUCTION
EFIBRILLATORS often use a small-signal ac measurement current in the range 10–100 kHz in order to ensure good electrode placement. In this frequency range, the
impedance between defibrillator pads on a human body is
predominantly resistive and normally matches the impedance
opposing the defibrillator current quite well.
Typical impedances of an Apex-Sternum placement of defibrillator pads are in the 25–200 Ω range, and defibrillation is
normally restricted to an impedance range close to this. Some
defibrillators have implemented extra functionality based on the
measured impedance; most common is ventilation monitoring
which is done by measuring the variation of the base impedance
caused by ventilation.
The modulation is normally below ±3 Ω and the signal can
be obscured by motion artifacts. It is believed that ventilation
detection/monitoring can be improved if the impedance measurement system was more optimized for this task.
It is the purpose of this study to find whether the respirational
plethysmographic signal amplitude can be increased by using a

four-electrode system [1], and to compare the admittance and
impedance parameters.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ten healthy male volunteers participated in this study. Average age was 30 years (21–40). They all gave informed consent
and the study was approved by the regional ethics committee.
All measurements were conducted in a controlled laboratory
with 22 ◦ C and 30% RH.
A. Impedance Measurements
All impedance measurements were done on healthy male
volunteers, using a Solartron 1260/1294 combination with a
controlled ac amplitude of 30 mV rms. At maximum inspiration
or maximum expiration, respectively, one complex spectrum
took about 45 s during which the test person held his breath.
(Note that this time could have been reduced, e.g., by utilizing time domain measurements with multisine or chirp signal
excitation [2].)
B. Defibrillator Measurements
A Philips HeartStart MRx, which has a controlled ac amplitude of 250 μA rms at 32 kHz for impedance measurement,
was used for the defibrillator measurements. The MRx is an
advanced monitor/defibrillator device with 12 lead ECG, blood
pressure, ETCO2, pulse-oximetry, networking capability, and
CPR feedback (QCPR) functionality.
C. Electrode Positioning
The Apex-Sternum electrode placement is shown in Fig. 1.
The defibrillator electrodes Philips Medical DP2/DP6 and the
small ECG electrodes are Ambu Blue Sensor Q00 A. The defibrillator electrodes were only used for the defibrillator measurements and for the Solatron two-electrode setup. The Blue
Sensor electrodes were used as voltage pick-up electrodes in the
four-electrode setup. The edge-to-edge distance between current
injecting and voltage pick-up electrodes is about 1 cm.
D. Forced Breathing and Generation of Motion Artifacts
For the time-series measurements, it was measured both during spontaneous breathing where the test subjects breathed
freely, and also during forced breathing where the subjects
respiration was controlled with an even rate. For the forced
breathing a manually operated calibration syringe with a volume of 750 mL, together with a valve system which allowed the

was used. The pump was fitted with a single use mouth piece
for each test subject.
Motion artifacts can be due to compression-induced changes
in either the electrode materials or in the measured tissue [3],
and different electrodes and electrode systems may be more or
less prone to producing motion artifacts [4]. In this study, motion
artifacts were generated by pushing on the electrodes; either by
hand on the lower electrode or using the MRx CPR sensor as an
interface between the hand and upper electrode.

III. RESULTS
A. Defibrillator Measurements
E. Protocol
The following protocol was followed for all the ten test subjects:
1) The person sat comfortably in a chair with no clothing on
the upper body. After a few minutes of acclimatization,
the electrodes were positioned.
2) The defibrillator was then connected to the two defibrillator electrodes and impedance measurements were done
continuously through the following sequence: 30 s of
spontaneous breathing, 60 s of forced breathing, a few
seconds of spontaneous breathing, and then 60 s of forced
breathing while repeatedly pressing on one of the defibrillator electrodes.
3) The person was then instead connected to the Solartron
1260/1294 system in a two-electrode setup, and the above
sequence was repeated, using a frequency of 32 kHz. The
person was then asked to breathe maximally in and keep
his breath during a frequency scan from 100 Hz to 1 MHz.
Subsequently, the person breathed maximally out and kept
his breath while a new frequency scan was conducted.
4) Lastly the same procedure, including the frequency scans,
was repeated with a four-electrode setup.

The results from the measured time-series with the defibrillator can be seen in Table I. The table shows the total number
of analyzed ventilations, the mean of all measured values in the
time series (mean baseline), the mean of the impedance change
for all ventilations (mean ventilation) with standard deviation,
and the relative ventilation amplitude. The mean relative ventilation amplitude was found to be 1.8%.
B. Solatron 1260/1294 Measurements
For the time series measurements, only the 60-s time period
with forced breathing was analyzed since during this period the
test subject has a fairly even and reproducible respiration rate.
1) Two-Electrode Setup: The results from the two-electrode
time series measurements are shown in Table II. Only
resistance values are analyzed. The mean relative ventilation
amplitude was found to be 2.5%.
A frequency scan with the two-electrode setup is shown as
mean values in Fig. 2, both at maximum inspiration and expiration. The relative difference between maximum expiration
and inspiration is shown in Figs. 3 and 4 as percent change
in impedance parameters (resistance and reactance) and admittance parameters (conductance and susceptance), respectively.

C. Four-Electrode Setup
The results from the four-electrode time series measurements
are shown in Table III. Only resistance values are analyzed. The
mean relative ventilation amplitude was found to be 4.0%.
The results from the frequency scans using a four-electrode
system [1] are shown as mean values in Figs. 5–7. Data from
one of the ten test subjects have been removed, since the lowfrequency reactance values for maximum expiration were more
than ten times higher than for any of the other subjects, and the
corresponding resistance about four times higher, hence indicating loose electrodes.
1) Noise Measurements: Fig. 8 shows a typical time course
of the measured resistance using the two-electrode system. The
last part of the time series shows noise caused by repeatedly
pressing one of the defibrillator electrodes. By visual inspection
of the curves, no significant difference in the noise contribution
between the two- and four-electrode measurements was found.
IV. DISCUSSION
Figs. 2 and 3 support the choice of 32 kHz for the impedance
measurements in the defibrillator. However, from the difference

in the mean relative ventilation amplitude between the twoand four-electrode setup using the Solartron 1260/1294 system,
there is an indication that the four-electrode setup is better suited
for picking up the small resistance changes due to respiration.
The differences between the two- and four-electrode setup will
now be further discussed.
In the two-electrode setup, the reactance increase diverges
to a very high value (359%) at 460 kHz. This is due to a very

1861

small phase angle as the phase is actually crossing zero in that
frequency range. At this frequency, the data did not meet the normality criterion and a one-sample Sign Test for the distribution
of relative reactance increase at 460 kHz revealed that the median increase was not significantly different from zero (p = 1.0).
Hence, what appears as very high sensitivity for the reactance
and susceptance at high frequencies is actually an artifact due
to small (random noise) changes in very small numbers.
The two-electrode results are clearly dominated by skin
impedance (2300 Ω at 100 Hz) [5] in the frequency range
100–1000 Hz, Fig. 2, which of course is not very dependent
on respiration, Figs. 3 and 4. At higher frequencies, the results
are determined by deeper tissue layers and the sensitivity to
respiration increases. The highest sensitivity can be attained by
measuring resistance (or equally well impedance since the phase
angle is very small) at frequencies around 100 kHz or higher
where a relative increase of around 18% can be achieved, or
alternatively by measuring susceptance in the frequency range
50–100 kHz where the decrease is 20%.
The same problem with low-phase angle as described with
the two-electrode system is present for low frequencies with
the four-electrode system. Extremely low (−122%) and high
(57%) average relative increases were found in the reactance at
the two lowest frequencies, respectively. At these frequencies,
the data did not meet the normality criterion and a one-sample
Sign Test for the distribution of relative reactance increase at
100 and 215 Hz revealed that the median increase was not
significantly different from zero (p = 0.51 for both). In fact the
reactance increase was not significantly different from zero for
any frequency below 100 kHz. For the susceptance, the extreme
value at 100 Hz (−110%) is not significantly different from zero
(p = 0.18) whereas values at 215 Hz (20%) and 464 Hz (−21%)
are marginally different from zero (p = 0.04).
The four-electrode method measures transfer impedance [6],
resulting in very low values around 40 Ω, which are clearly not
influenced by skin impedance. An appreciable respiration sensitivity of around 18% (see Figs. 6 and 7) is therefore possible
even at 100 Hz. As for the two-electrode measurements, it is also
found here that resistance or impedance measurements at high
frequencies (above 100 kHz) yield good sensitivity (30%–35%).
The highest sensitivity, however, is found for susceptance measurements between 20 and 100 kHz, where a relative increase
of 35% was achieved.
For the four-electrode measurements, using the impedance
modulus yields basically the same results as using resistance,
since the phase angle is very small. For the two-electrode measurements, the results for using only the impedance modulus
give a mean relative ventilation amplitude that is about 1%
lower than for the resistance throughout the frequency range.
Only male subjects were measured in this study. This may
possibly influence the conclusions about the sensitivity of the
monitoring of the respiration, since the thoracic impedance is
influenced by the female chest [7].
No significant difference in the noise contribution between
the two- and four-electrode measurements was found. However,
it should be noted that a four-electrode system in some cases

1862

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 6, JUNE 2014

may produce more noise than a two-electrode system, e.g., in
the case of drying voltage pick-up electrodes in combination
with a very high input impedance differential amplifier.
V. CONCLUSION
It has been shown that the addition of two extra electrodes
is beneficial for the measurement of respiration. With the two
electrode setup, the increase in resistance due to respiration is
only 1.38% at 100 Hz and increases to 18.18% at 1 MHz, while
for the four electrode setup the increase in resistance is 18.40%
at 100 Hz and increases to 34.16% at 1 MHz. It is furthermore
concluded that with the four-electrode setup, it is also possible to measure the respiration at low frequencies, whereas for
the two-electrode setup the measurements at low frequencies
are dominated by the skin impedance. No significant difference
was found between using impedance modulus and resistance
values, but a small improvement of sensitivity could be achieved
by using the susceptance.
