Strain Analysis From 4-D Cardiac CT Image Data
Yechiel Lamash∗ , Anath Fischer, Shemy Carasso, and Jonathan Lessick

Abstract—Strain is a discriminative parameter of regional myocardial dysfunction. Despite the large body of research on myocardial strain analysis in echocardiography and MR images, such
techniques have not often been applied to cardiac CT data. Reasons for this include the challenges of sparse image deformation
clues and the low temporal resolution. In the current study, we
propose an algorithm that uses cardiac CT data to evaluate the
mechanical function of the left ventricle. The algorithm is based
on a deformable LV model that contains both the myocardium
and the blood pool regions and that accounts for the elasticity and
incompressibility of the myocardium with the rapid contraction
of the blood pool. Our algorithm uses the image intensities of the
trabeculle and papillary muscles as well as the border edges in
an optical flow manner to extract the 3-D velocities. The resulting
strains and rotational values derived from a set of normal patients
correlate highly with values from the research literature. We validated our algorithm against 2-D speckle tracking analysis and
against visual scores obtained by an expert. Our study shows that
strain analysis using CT data can be used in clinical practice.
Index Terms—Cardiac CT, deformable model, left ventricle

I. INTRODUCTION
ARDIAC pathologies, the main cause of morbidity and
mortality in the western world, are generally associated
with regional ventricular dysfunction. Noninvasive techniques
such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) are currently used for clinical evaluation of left ventricle
(LV) function. MRI applied to the in vivo heart facilitates the
tagging of virtual dark lines on the tomographic image [1]. These
virtual lines are attached to the myocardium and deform with it,
facilitating visualization and measurement of the deformation.
Cine MR has also been proposed for LV function estimation [2].
Yet MRI is slow, not widely available, and cannot be used for
the rapidly growing population of patients with implanted pacemakers or defibrillators. Echocardiography is widely used in
clinics for cardiac function assessment. However, the variance
of repeated echocardiography measures is fairly high owing to
dependence on operator experience, machine setting, available
acoustic window, and angle of incidence effect [3].

Multidetector Computed tomography (MDCT) is becoming
increasingly more important in the diagnosis of cardiac diseases.
For example, the decision to perform coronary revascularization
is best informed by delineating objective evidence of inducible
myocardial ischemia. Cardiac CT is now an established technique for assessing coronary heart disease [4]. Nevertheless,
this anatomical visualization fails to provide the more important functional information about the myocardial tissue. Major
recent advancements in MDCT temporal resolution, scanning
coverage, and dose reduction algorithms have led to the possibility of a “one-stop-shop” for cardiovascular imaging that would
provide information on anatomy, function, perfusion, and viability [5]. Regional myocardial strains have direct or indirect
relationships with cardiac diseases [6] as they encapsulate the
basic mechanical function of the myocardium [2]. Despite the
large body of research on myocardial strain analysis in echocardiography and MR images [2], [6], [7] , such techniques have
not often been applied to cardiac CT data. The problem of tracking the LV from cardiac CT images is difficult for the following
reasons. First, the relatively low temporal resolution allows for
the reconstruction of only about ten independent phases. Second, while in echocardiography speckles are located all over the
myocardium, the only markers in CT are the edge of the endocardial border, the trabeculle, and the papillary muscles. Third,
in order to reduce the scan radiation dose, a dose modulation is
generally used, which reduces the X-ray tube current in phases
(frames) with large motion. This process significantly reduces
the SNR in a significant number of phases. The aim of the current study is to develop a method that overcomes these issues
and enables strain analysis from cardiac CT image data.
A. LV Regional Function Using Cardiac CT
Several studies have estimated regional myocardial function
from MDCT data using the motion and thickening of the heart’s
wall during contraction. Model-based methods [8] fit the heart
model to different phases, after which the velocity and the wall
thickening are calculated. Yet these methods, which were originally meant for segmentation, are incapable of extracting motion
components that are tangential to the model surface. Song et al.
[9] proposed an optical flow technique with divergence-free and
incompressibility constraints to construct the 3-D velocity field
from 4-D cardiac-CT data. Yet the technique was never validated
on CT patient data. Feature-matching methods [3], [10] aim at
finding a correspondence between local features. Simon et al.
[10] used a surface-volume matching process based on Markov
random fields to extract cardiac motion, although their method
has not been validated against ground truth. Another study [3]
proposed a new regional function measurement based on local changes in the triangular areas of a fitted surface mesh. This
study used nonrigid surface registration based on local curvature
of the endocardium to warp a surface mesh of one phase into
another. Yet, this research is at a very preliminary stage, and the

relationship between this new functional measurement and standard strain and twist parameters has not yet been established.
Recently, two clinical studies that use 2-D image registration
algorithms for calculating strain analysis from cardiac CT were
proposed [11], [12]. However, both methods are 2-D based and
do not utilize the unique 3-D isotropic resolution of cardiac CT
image data and thus ignore the velocity components outside the
image plane.
Biomechanical models have attracted much attention during
the last decade and have also been suggested for 4-D cardiac
image analysis [13]. In this framework, a biomechanical heart
model is initially registered into the first time frame of patientspecific data. Then, information concerning tissue deformation,
such as elastic properties and myocardial fiber orientation, is
used as prior knowledge. Papademetris et al. [14] suggested a
modality-independent method for estimating 3-D LV deformation from 3-D image sequences using a biomechanical model.
The method is initialized with a shape-based tracking algorithm that tries to follow points on successive surfaces using
a shape similarity metric. Thereafter, a biomechanical model
with a transversely isotropic, linear-elastic model that accounts
for the muscle fiber directions is used to achieve a probabilistic
estimate of the complete deformation field. This method was
applied to human cine-MR images, and canine cine-CT images
were validated against surgically implanted markers. Our approach is similar to that of Papademetris et al. [14] in that we
also register an LV mesh model to a reference phase and then
estimate the deforming forces to the rest of the phases. Nevertheless, our method differs in several ways. First, our mesh model
contains both the myocardium and the blood pool. The myocardium is represented as an isotropic incompressible elastic
material, while the blood pool elements have only smoothness
constraints to allow rapid motion of the endocardial surface.
The blood pool region with its trabeculle and papillary muscles
is used as important image clues for capturing the rotational
velocities. Second, the deformation forces are generated by the
image intensities only with respect to optical flow. Third, we use
data from dual source CT that has doubled temporal resolution.
Finally, our algorithm is dedicated to regular scans of cardiac
CT images with dose modulation from human patients.
B. Deformable Models Versus Image Registration
Imaging the LV requires a dedicated tracking algorithm that
can express the ventricle’s unique kinematics. The LV consists
of blood and muscle, which have different material properties
and exhibit two different mechanical behaviors. The endocardial surface moves rapidly, while the epicardial surface is nearly
static. Our algorithm uses a deformable LV mesh with defined
myocardium and blood pool regions and labeled endocardial and
epicardial surfaces to derive the deforming forces. The algorithm
can also be considered to be a parametric image registration (or
optical flow) algorithm as it uses the image intensities to extract
the dense velocities. However, while most image registration
algorithms work on a regular (rectilinear) grid, they cannot effectively separate blood and myocardium. In addition, the rapid
motion of the endocardial surface toward the center is difficult
to model using basis functions that are represented on a regular
grid. Radial basis functions such as thin plate spline [15], which
does not work on a regular grid, cannot model continuous mo-

tion with two separated regional properties. Variational image
registration for a domain with spatial varying properties was also
proposed [16]. Nevertheless, variational methods generally use a
multiresolution scheme. The regular pixel grid of the coarse
level images cannot effectively split materials, and convergence
may not be guaranteed for objects with narrow thickness (such
as the myocardium). Linear basis functions, commonly used in
finite element (FE) analysis, can model continuous motion of
freeform shapes with their material properties. These functions
that are not represented on a regular grid can be used as parametric image registration. Image registration using the linear basis
function has previously been used for registering brain images
[17]. Our method performs parametric image registration with
geometrical separation to account for different material properties of the domain.
C. Contributions
The main contribution of our research is a 3-D tracking
method for performing strain analysis on regular dosemodulated cardiac CT image data. To the best of our knowledge,
our approach is the first to show regional strains with rotational
velocities from such image data.
Another contribution is the introduction of a parametric image registration method with geometrical separation, which accounts for the different material properties of the domain.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the method, including the motivation and mathematical formalism of the registration functional. It also details the
optimization, including an inverse compositional approach for
faster runtime. Sections III and IV describe the validation experiments and results, respectively. Section V provides the discussion and conclusions.
II. METHOD
A. LV Mesh Model for the Myocardium and Blood Pool
The current section describes our LV mesh model for the myocardium and blood pool and its registration to the first phase before the tracking is initiated. We initialize the algorithm by first
segmenting the LV blood pool, performing triangular meshing
of the endocardial and epicardial surfaces, and then generating a
tetrahedral volume mesh of the blood pool and myocardium. The
papillary muscles and trabeculle are included in the blood pool
region and serve as important clues (together with the curved
endocardial border) for capturing the endocardial rotational velocities. In order to fine tune the mesh nodes at the epicardial
surface, we construct a volumetric template with representative intensities on the myocardium and blood HU values and
perform registration to align the volumetric template to the first
3-D frame. Finally, we allow interactive user modification of the
mesh nodal points for optimal accuracy of the nodal positions.
Despite the major interest in modeling LV deformation using
fiber orientation, the effective improvement in terms of modeling
cardiac electromechanics is still unclear. Geerts et al. [18] conducted a sensitivity study by evaluating changes in predicted
mechanics in a model of the LV. They concluded that the benefit of accounting for patient-specific geometry is questionable
when using experimental data on fiber orientation. Carapella
et al. 2013 [19] evaluated the improvement in predictive power

gained by introducing subject-specific fiber models within an
electromechanical model of left ventricular contraction in rats.
They compared both global rule-based fiber models with a locally optimized image-based fiber model. Their results showed
large differences between predicted and measured values. They
concluded that further study of the constitutive behavior and
architecture of cardiac tissue is required before electromechanical models can fully benefit from the introduction of subjectspecific fibers. In addition, subject-specific fiber models are
currently based on atlases derived from normal patients, and
their benefit for quantification of regional pathology of the
myocardium compared to regular methods has not been reported. Moreover, models that include the fiber orientation require meshes with tens of thousands elements [20]. Because the
dose-modulated CT data has low SNR and sparse image clues
and because the effective improvement of the fiber orientation
is unclear, our model contains 413 nodes and 1680 tetrahedral elements, where the myocardial elements have isotropic
elastic properties that account for myocardium elasticity and
incompressibility.

F. Inverse Update
Baker and Mathews [22] realized that for transformations that
form a group, a significant amount of computation time can be
saved when switching the role of the image and the template in
the objective function and using an inverse compositional update scheme. In this case, the Jacobian and Hessian matrices are
constant and therefore can be precomputed. Later, Mathews and
Baker [23] used first-order approximation of the inverse compositional update using the backward update for AAM. Here,
by implementing the backward update using the linear functions, we also obtained good convergences with precomputed
Jacobian and Hessian matrices. The backward updating term:

G. Implementation Issues
We implement the image warping as follows. For each tetrahedron, we find the barycentric coordinates (α, β, γ) of its inner
pixels that reside on the image grid. We then find the respective
value in the reference image and insert it in the warped image.
To find the grid pixels of each tetrahedron, we took the grid pixels of the minimal box that bounds the tetrahedron and looked
up the pixels whose barycentric coordinates apply: α, β, γ ≥ 0
and α + β + γ ≤ 1.
We perform phase-to-phase registration, starting from phase
0% toward the end systolic phase forward and from phase 0%
backward to the first diastolic phase.
The current runtime of the algorithms is about 5 min in the
MATLAB workspace on a standard computer with five cores.
We expect that by implementing the algorithm in C + +, and by
running each frame-to-frame registration on different cores in
parallel, the overall runtime will be in the order of seconds and
will thus be highly attractive to physicians in clinical practice.

Mathematical phantom of a dynamic cardiac CT short-axis slice.

H. Experiments
1) Mathematical Phantom of Cardiac CT: In order to test
our approach on cardiac CT image data, with reference to common image registration algorithms, we have generated a dynamic mathematical phantom of a cardiac CT short-axis slice.
We measured the distances of a set of landmark points transformed by the registration method to their true locations. The
contraction was set to simulate normal circumferential and radial strains with endocardial and epicardial rotations of 10◦ and
5◦ , respectively. A forward projection of the attenuation image
was used to create a realistic image with motion artifacts and
typical Poissonic noise, by simulating cardiac motion and taking into account the systems temporal resolution. We assumed a
heart rate of 60 beat per minute. The virtual scan parameters are
shown in Table I. Nine phases of the virtual phantom are shown
in Fig. 2. We compared the results of the proposed algorithm
to the B-spline registration [24] and to the variational-based
elastic image registration [25] that was performed between images of subsequent phases. For the proposed method, the elastic
regularization potential was operated on the myocardial region.
The B-spline registration was performed with a grid of 8 × 8.
The elastic image registration was performed in a multiresolution framework. The comparison was performed on the LV
pixels only.
2) Cardiac CT Dataset: To validate our algorithm on real
world data, we used retrospective cardiac CT datasets from 27
patients, of whom 15 and 12 patients were diagnosed as normal
and abnormal, respectively. The studies were imaged by a dual-

516

source Siemens SOMATOM definition flash scanner with dose
modulation. For each study, ten phases were reconstructed and
used for analysis. Of the described group, ten patients also had
echocardiography speckle tracking (EST) analysis within one
month. The CT and EST examinations were performed under
similar conditions and without any intervention or clinical event
between them. We performed three types of analyses. In the
first analysis, we compared the results of 15 normal patients to
respective normal values from the literature. In the second analysis, we compared individual CT and EST results. In the third
analysis, we compared the strain results of the entire group to
visual scores obtained by an expert (experienced cardiologist).
The scores, 1 normal, 2-hypokinetic, 3-dyskinetic or akinetic,
were mapped using standard AHA 17 segments [26]. For the
EST analysis, we used the velocity vector imaging (VVI) software (Siemens Medical Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA)
because it is the only software which is able to analyze data
from different vendors and because it is the only software to provide subendocardial and subepicardial strains. For calculating
the various strain and rotation parameters, we used conventional
definitions from the literature [27], [28].
The parameter values were 75 kPa and 0.45 for Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio, respectively. Since a fully incompressible material has a Poisson ratio of 0.5, an acceptable Poisson
ratio for the myocardium by many studies is 0.45 [29]. Literature values of Young’s modulus for the myocardium range from
20 kPa to 500 kPa. The myocardiums stiffness varies among patients and during the heart cycle. In the current study, we used
the data of two normal patients for tuning the Young’s modulus
and epicardial traction force that will produce acceptable strains
and rotation values. Thereafter, the total set of normal and abnormal patients was used for validation. The traction t was 15 k.
Both ω and λ had a value of 1, and μ had a value of 10 k.
As a postprocessing step, the contribution and effect of each
of the functional ingredients on the measured strains and twist
were evaluated. We interchangeably eliminated and reweighted
the different terms in the registration functional and measured
the effect on the measured strains and twist.
III. RESULTS
Exemplar results of strains and rotations of a normal patient
are shown in Fig. 3.

ison, ten values at 0%, 10%, . . . , 90% were sampled along the
heart cycle for each territory. By setting thresholds on the EST
strain data, normal and abnormal territories were set, and the
algorithm-resulted strain’s ability to classify the territories was
evaluated. The thresholds for endocardial circumferential strain,
radial strain, epicardial circumferential strain, and circumferential strain rate were −20, 25, −8, and −1.15, respectively. The
results are summarized in Table IV.

The contribution and effect of each of the different ingredients in the registration functional on the measured strains and
twist were analyzed. We univariately changed the λ, μ, and ω
parameters and measured the effect on the mean values of the
main strains and twist parameters (Changing λ or ω is equivalent
to changing E or t, respectively). Eliminating the Laplacian term
of the blood pool region (by setting μ = 0) reduced the mesh
stability and caused the blood pool vertices to fluctuate outside
the LV mesh. However, as the strain and twist parameters are
calculated in the myocardial region, changes in μ values had a
negligible effect on the measured strains and twist. The change
in the lambda parameter, which regulates the stiffness of the
myocardium, had the strongest effect on the strains and twist
(see Fig. 7, left). Reduction in either μ or λ results in larger
strain values whereas an increase in either parameter results in
decreased strains. Changes are relatively small within a range of
−40% to +100% for all parameters. The ω parameter, that controls the motion of the epicardial surface, had an opposite effect
on the radial strain with respect to the rest of the parameters.
As ω increases, the radial strain increases, whereas the absolute
values of the circumferential strain, long strain, and twist decrease (see Fig. 7, Fig. 8 right). The analysis is summarized in
Table VII.

first analysis, we compared the results of 15 normal patients
to respective normal values from the literature. In the second
analysis, we compared individual CT and EST results. In the

The LV consists of two types of tissue, blood and muscle,
each having different material properties and different mechanical behaviors. For example, the myocardium is nearly incompressible while the blood pool region is highly compressible. In
order to enable these two distinct behaviors, the myocardium
and blood pool must be separated and be assigned with appropriate material properties. The proposed method results show
24% and 8% lower L2 errors and 39% and 11% lower L∞ errors compared to the B-spline [24] and elastic registration [25]
algorithms, respectively. The main reason is that image registration algorithms with a motion field that is modeled using a
regular grid of control points cannot effectively differentiate between these two mechanical behaviors. On the other hand, linear
basis functions with control points (mesh vertices) positioned
on the boundaries can model motion field with several different
mechanical behaviors.
B. Comparison to Literature Values
The ability to capture the complex kinematics of the LV is an
important major step toward quantification of a patients LV mechanical function. The results of strains and rotations correlate

proposed algorithm to those obtained by EST (see Table IV).
The territories (rather than segments) were compared to minimize the optional misalignment between the compared regions
of the 3-D CT results and the 2-D EST results. Reasonable
correlations were obtained between the twist and apical rotation of the algorithm results on CT data and the respective
EST values.

well with respective values obtained by other imaging modalities (see Table II). Our algorithm captures the clockwise and
counterclockwise basal and apical rotational velocities. Modelbased methods [8] that segment the LV phases separately are
incapable of extracting motion components that are tangential
to the models surface. Unlike other approaches [14], our LV
model contains the blood pool region wherein the trabeculle
and papillary muscles are used as important image clues in capturing the rotational velocities.
C. Validation Against EST
Good correlations (see Fig. 5) and excellent sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive

The ability of the current algorithm to classify the segments into a diagnostically meaningful group was tested. Good
sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV) were
obtained by comparing the algorithm results to visual scores
obtained by cardiologists (see Tables V and VI). The relative
low PPV is due to the small ratio of impaired segments. The
better agreement obtained in the comparison to EST suggests
that the proposed algorithm has added value over visual assessment with respect to diagnosis. The superior agreement of
radial strain to visual score and the superior agreement of circumferential strain to EST strains suggest that it is easier to
diagnose the myocardial thickening visually, while the circumferential shortening is better estimated by the algorithm. The
large variance of radial strains obtained by different EST vendors [31] and the superior agreement between the radial strains
obtained by the proposed algorithm on CT data suggest that
the better contrast-to-noise ratio in CT data (due to the contrast media) leads to better estimation of radial strain compared
to EST.
E. Effect of the Regularization on the Measured Strains
and Twist
The contribution and effect of each of the different ingredients in the registration functional on the measured strains and
twist were analyzed. We univariately changed the λ, μ, and ω
parameters and measured the effect on the mean values of the
main strains and twist parameters. The center of the blood pool
is generally a homogenous region without meaningful motion
clues. The Laplacian operator prevents fluctuations of vertices
located in the center of the blood pool. In general, the Laplacian puts a quadratic penalty on both the curl and divergence
of a vector field. However, here the Laplacian is operated on
the blood pool mesh region that undergoes a global rotation
and contraction. As the Laplacian operator approximates the
second-order derivative, linear transformations including con-

traction and rotation are not penalized by it. This enables the
endocardial vertices to rotate around the central axis while suppressing the relative motion of vertices in the center of the blood
pool.
The edge between the myocardium and fat is less pronounced
than the edge between the myocardium and blood. The epicardial traction force prevents pulling of the epicardial vertices by
the endocardial vertices and together with the data term keeps
them within the epicardial boundary.
Selection of Youngs modulus as 75 kPa with λ = 1 turned
out to be a good choice in term of stability: Within the range
of [−40%, +80%], all mean strains and twist change by less
than 20% with a maximal standard deviation of 6% while also
having good agreement to literature values [27]. Lowering the
stiffness parameter λ increases the difference between values of
normal and abnormal segments (i.e., the between group variability) while increasing the within group variability and vice
versa, so that the overall statistical difference between normal
and abnormal segments is preserved.

V. CONCLUSION
In the current study, we propose analyzing LV strain and
rotational analysis using cardiac CT image data. The current
study is novel and quite applicable in clinical practice, where
it can have a major impact. Typically, echocardiography or MR
imaging techniques are used to compute mechanical cardiac parameters such as strain, rotation, or twist. The current study is
the first to show that strain analysis can be obtained by regular
MDCT data. Cardiac CT is the only noninvasive modality able
to image the coronary arteries. The addition of strain analysis
to the existing capabilities may decrease unnecessary examinations, promote cardiac CT as a “one-stop shop” method [5], and
facilitate cardiac patient workflow.
