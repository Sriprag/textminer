in Terahertz Regime

Abstract—The double Debye model has been used to understand
the dielectric response of different types of biological tissues at terahertz (THz) frequencies but fails in accurately simulating human
breast tissue. This leads to limited knowledge about the structure,
dynamics, and macroscopic behavior of breast tissue, and hence,
constrains the potential of THz imaging in breast cancer detection.
The first goal of this paper is to propose a new dielectric model
capable of mimicking the spectra of human breast tissue’s complex permittivity in THz regime. Namely, a non-Debye relaxation
model is combined with a single Debye model to produce a mixture
model of human breast tissue. A sampling gradient algorithm of
nonsmooth optimization is applied to locate the optimal fitting solution. Samples of healthy breast tissue and breast tumor are used in
the simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
Our simulation demonstrates exceptional fitting quality in all cases.
The second goal is to confirm the potential of using the parameters
of the proposed dielectric model to distinguish breast tumor from
healthy breast tissue, especially fibrous tissue. Statistical measures
are employed to analyze the discrimination capability of the model
parameters while support vector machines are applied to assess
the possibility of using the combinations of these parameters for
higher classification accuracy. The obtained analysis confirms the
classification potential of these features.

I. INTRODUCTION
ECENT developments in broadband-pulse generation of
terahertz (THz) radiation and its detection has accelerated
biomedical applications in this frequency range. The THz imaging has now emerged as a potential medical imaging technique
to identify contrast between various types of tissue [1]–[3]. Its
advances are based on the nature of THz radiation. Having
longer wavelengths than those in visible/near-infrared domain,
THz waves propagate inside biological tissues with less scattering. Significantly low power levels of THz radiation in typical
time-domain systems satisfy the recommended safety threshold

for the human body [4]. Another distinct asset is the high sensitivity of THz to water/high water-content materials, making
THz imaging a feasible tool for cancer detection [5]. The high
absorption of THz radiation by water is considered as a dominant agent producing visible contrast features in THz images
between normal and cancerous tissues due to the higher water
content of tumor in comparison to normal tissue [6]. Protein,
RNA, and DNA content are postulated to affect the interaction of
THz radiation with tissue, along with water, and hence, present
themselves as potential sources of contrast [2], [7].
The THz images showing contrast between healthy breast
tissues and tumors in previous studies show the potential of
the imaging technique for accurately detecting the margins of
cancer in breast conserving surgery (BCS) [2], [3]. While the
increase in absorption and refractive index of breast tumor compared with healthy tissue can explain the contrast in THz images,
their root causes still require more thorough studies to be explicated [8]. Apart from this, a solid understanding of the contrast
mechanism also has a positive impact on determining essential features for more accurate classification, and hence, more
precise cancer-margin detection in BCS. In fact, modeling dielectric properties plays a vital role not only in explaining the
distinct features between healthy tissue and tumor in THz images, but also in providing potential parameters for tissue pathology diagnosis and cancer detection and improved diagnostic
instrumentation.
The dielectric model can offer a theoretical framework characterizing the complex permittivity of tissue, which reflects
interactions between molecules and the THz radiation [7].
For instance, the complex permittivity of human skin in the
THz regime can be described by the double-Debye model,
which combines the slow and fast relaxation processes of water
molecules [9]. This dielectric function was initially used for polar liquid, especially water, and its application for human skin
is supported by the fact that skin contains a large proportion
of water. However, the free water content of other human body
parts may be considerably less than that of skin, which means
that the dielectric responses of those tissues may not comply
with the simple Debye relaxations. Alternatively, the so-called
biological water, or hydration water, which is constructed by
chains of protein and their surrounding water molecules, with
its increasing content is likely to cause non-Debye responses
in dielectric spectra of tissue [10]. Indeed, the double-Debye
model fails to obtain a requisite fit for complex permittivity of
breast tissue due to an increase observed in the real part of complex permittivity spectra of human breast in the range below
1 THz [8]. The heterogeneity of breast tissue may form more

complex molecular chains affecting the dielectric response.
A suitable permittivity model for breast in THz regime is yet to
be achieved in the literature. The first aim of our study is to propose a new mixture dielectric model, which not only provides
an excellent fit to the complex permittivity of both healthy and
cancerous breast tissue but also facilitate a deeper insight into
the contrast mechanism at a molecular level. Second, the model
parameters are investigated in terms of their physical relevance
to breast tissue pathology information as well as their potential
of breast cancer classification. The obtained results shows that
our proposed dielectric model can excellently fit experimental
data in most cases, while the extracted parameters of this model
have a Pearson correlation of about 75% with fat and tumor
percentages of examined tissue samples. The potential parameters of the dielectric model for breast cancer classification are
confirmed through positive outcomes of the statistical analysis including independent two-tailed t-test and receiver operator
characteristics (ROC) analysis. Leave-one-out cross-validation
(LOOCV) values with support vector machines (SVM) classifiers support combining the model parameters to improve the
classification accuracy in THz imaging of breast cancer.
This paper has the following structure. Section II is to introduce the mixture model of breast tissue, propose the fitting algorithm to extract the parameters of the proposed models, describe the tested data and discuss on simulation results.
Section III provides the statistical and classification analysis of
the extracted model parameters. Eventually, we summarize our
contributions in Section IV.
II. DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES MODELING
A. Dielectric Model of Human Breast Tissue
Human tissue is commonly considered as a dispersive material whose dielectric properties including relative permittivity
and conductivity depend on frequency. The increase of frequency leads to a remarkable decrease in the relative permittivity but conversely causes an upturn in conductivity. Complex
permittivity of human tissue in a very low frequency range is
well-described by the single-Debye relaxation model, while its
responses in higher frequencies above 0.1 THz require extra
Debye relaxation processes [11]

where Δn indicates the permittivity dispersion of the nthDebye relaxation process. The underlined fact of the multipleDebye model is the higher water content of various human
tissues [12], [13]. The double-Debye model was initially used
as a dielectric function of water, and then, has inspired a significant number of applications for highly hydrated mixtures [7],
[9], [14], [15]. For instance, the complex permittivity of human
skin, which contains around 70% of water, has been accurately
predicted by the two Debye relaxation processes [16], [17]. Muscle with higher water content than skin employs the summation
of five Debye dispersions in addition to a frequency-dependent

conductivity term [18]

However, dielectric properties of biological tissues with low
water content and more complicated structure and composition exhibit broader dispersion that may involve superposition
of several relaxation processes or non-first-order kinematics of
molecular structure. The broadening of the dispersion could be
resolved by adding a distribution parameter, and thus, the Cole–
Cole (CC) equation has been introduced as an alternative of the
Debye equation [13]. Eventually, the experimental dielectric
spectra of various human tissues may be effectively described
by multiple CC relaxation model [13], [19], [20] as

where αn is the distribution parameter measuring the broadening of the dispersion nth. The nonexponential relaxation
processes described by the CC equation constitute a special
case of non-Debye dielectric relaxation. The Havriliak–Negami

In this regard, human breast is also composed of inhomogeneous structures of fat cells and proteins. The fatty (adipose)
tissues have a low water content, and therefore, play a substantial role in regulating the dielectric responses of breast tissue.
Indeed, the spectra of real permittivity of breast tissue increase
at the low frequencies and pose quite a flat response over the
higher frequency range, which is similar to that of pure adipose tissue. Particularly, Fig. 1 presents the average measured
complex permittivities versus the frequencies for breast tumor,
healthy fibrous breast tissue (fibrous), and healthy adipose tissue (fat), which were published by [8]. The error bars show
the standard errors of the mean values with 95% confidence
interval. Further details of the data are thoroughly described in
Section II-C. Accordingly, while the most noticeable feature in
dielectric properties of the breast tissues is the peak at around
0.32 THz, a similar increase is also spotted at 0.5 THz in dielectric spectrum of fat tissue. The physical origin of this dielectric
response is yet to be understood [8], [22]. Therefore, we consider the increase of permittivity of breast tissue in the low range
of THz regime as a non-Debye response. Apart from this, breast
tissue still contains a relative-high proportion of water, which
is the most prevalent source of absorption in THz frequencies,
and thus, its complex permittivity like that of human skin may
be also contributed by dielectric properties of water. In fact,
the increase of THz frequency results in greater contribution
of water absorption, thus the Debye relaxation process may be
more transparent in the range above 1 THz. Considering the two
aforementioned factors driving the dielectric spectra of breast
tissue, we propose the following empirical mixture model based

Here, the term (ωτ 1 Δ1 + Δ2 ) produces the peak in the real
part of the complex permittivity of breast tissue at frequencies
below 1 THz. Δ1 and Δ2 underline the existence of two
dielectric dispersions occurring in the slow relaxation process
characterized by time constant τ 1 . However, it is important to
emphasize that proposing these two parameters is more empirical rather than underlying any physical process, and thus, they
should be simply regarded as necessary parameters to provide
accurate fits. The dispersive amplitude of fast relaxation mode
with the time constant τ 2 is 3 corresponding to high frequency.
∞ is the limiting permittivity constant at very high frequency.
σ/jω represents the impact of dc-conductivity on dielectric loss
of tissue.
As the real and imaginary part of the complex permittivity
have different impacts on the values of the introduced parameters in (5), the significance of the difference in these two features
between healthy breast tissues and tumor can suggest the cancer discrimination potential of the model parameters. Therefore,
the normalized differences in the real and imaginary part of the
average complex permittivities between tumor and healthy tissues, both fibrous and fat, were calculated and plotted over the
examined frequency range in Fig. 2. Accordingly, the variation
of the imaginary part of the complex permittivity between the
healthy and cancerous tissues is more significant than that of
the real part in most of the spectral range. The fact that only σ
is fully driven by the dielectric loss marks this parameter as the
most prevalent indicator of breast cancer among the parameters
of the model (5). The theoretical assessment will be statistically
investigated in depth in Section III-A.
B. Fitting Algorithm
In order to fit the data and extract the proper parameters of (5), we employ the sum of squared error functions
(SSE), which calculate the differences between the measured
frequency-dependent complex permittivities and their predicted
values by one of these models over a range of consecutive THz
frequencies.

Set y = (∞ , Δ1 , Δ2 , Δ3 , σ)T = (y 1 , y 2 , y 3 , y 4 ,

where ˜(ωi ) defined by (5) is a highly nonlinear function of 8-D
variable (y, τ 1 , τ 2 , α), while ˜m (ωi ) stands for the measured
complex permittivity at a frequency ωi . M is the number of
sampling frequencies. The constraints of the model parameters
in (6) are chosen to maintain the necessary physics properties
of the complex dielectric model.
The problem (6) is seen as a very challenging optimization
problem, for which the standard optimization tools and software
are hardly suitable. Our first step is to analyze partially convex
structures of (6) that are useful for computational purpose. It
is seen from (5) that the objective function in (6) is convex
quadratic in y when the three variables τ 1 , τ 2 , α are held fixed.
Thus, by setting x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (τ 1 , τ 2 , α), we reexpress

For solution of (8), we will employ the robust gradient sampling algorithm [24]. The beforehand selected parameters are as
follows.
1) Backtracking reduction factor 0 < γ < 1. We choose γ =
0.5.
2) Armijo parameter in line search 0 < β < 1. However, we
choose a very small value of the Armijo parameter, which
is practically equivalent to its nonstandard choice of 0.
3) Sampling size m > dim(x) = 3. Thus, we set this parameter to m = 7.
4) Optimality tolerance reduction factor θ = 1.
5) Sampling radius reduction factor μ = 0.5.
Initial parameters that will be iteratively updated are
1) Sampling radius ratio 0 = 0.1.

Refractive indices and absorption coefficients of 74 breast
samples are used to test the validity of the proposed model (5).
The data were presented with group average values and error
bars in [8]. Measurement procedures using THz spectroscopy
in transmission geometry were also fully described by [8]. In
brief, breast specimens were excised from 20 nonconsecutive female patients and preserved in refrigerated and humid condition.
A THz time-domain spectrometer (TPIspectra1000, TeraView
Ltd, Cambridge, U.K.) was used to measure the transmitted THz
pulses through the tissue samples prepared from the patient specimens. The THz properties of the samples were calculated by
averaging the measured refractive indices and absorption coefficients. The percentage content of fat (healthy adipose tissue),
fibrous (healthy fibrous tissue), and cancer/tumor for each sample was determined by a Consultant Breast Pathologist and this
served as a true reference to evaluate the THz data. Then, each
of these samples was categorized according to its predominant
constituent, which occupied more than 50% of the whole tissue.

Complex permittivities calculated from these spectra represent
the standard dielectric response of fat, fibrous tissue, and tumor
of human breast to THz radiation. More details of the calculations to obtain the data were thoroughly provided in [8].
D. Fitting Results
In this section, the capability of the model (5) to simulate
the complex permittivity of human breast tissue is investigated
through fitting this model to the data of pure adipose tissue,
fibrous tissue, and tumor. We employ the adjusted R-square
value (aR2 ), which is the square of the correlation between the
response values and the predicted response values, to analyze
the fitting quality [25]. It can be seen in Table I that the adjust
R-squares in all three cases achieve the overall value from 0.99.
Figs. 3, 4 and 5 demonstrate the comparison between complex
permittivity simulated by (5) and the measured data for healthy
breast tissue and breast tumor, respectively. The proposed dielectric model (5) mimics very well the dielectric properties of
breast tissue not only at the high range of frequency beyond
1 THz but also at the lower frequencies. It is worth emphasizing that the non-Debye response of the real part of the breast
tissue complex permittivity can be characterized well by (5).
This advance of the model (5) is practically essential for breast
cancer detection as the maximum difference between healthy
and cancerous tissue in optical properties was found at the low
spectral range, especially 0.32 THz [8]. The fitting parameters
of (5) and aR2 s for healthy tissue and tumor are recorded in
Table II. Accordingly, the contrast values in the model parameters of (5) between healthy and cancerous tissue suggest the

potential of treating these parameters as indicators to classify
the breast tumors.
The fitting parameters of (5) and aR2 s for all samples are
recorded in groups of fat, fibrous, and tumor with their average
values (AVR) and corresponding standard errors (SE) in Table II.
According to the statistical values of aR2 , the model (5) can
simulate the measured complex permittivities of fibrous tissue
and tumor better than those of fat tissue. This may be explained
by the higher water content of the former, especially tumor. In
fact, since THz radiation is very sensitive to water, the dielectric
properties of tumor and fiber possess less nonsmooth responses
and noise both of which can negative impact on the predictability

of the model (5). In general, the AVRs of ∞ , Δ1 , Δ3 , τ 1 , τ 2 ,
α are not apparently different between breast tissue types, while
the large SEs of these parameters reveal the high possibility of
overlaps of their values between tissue groups. On the contrary,
Δ2 and σ have obvious different AVRs between dominantly
fat, fibrous, and tumor tissues, while their SE are rather small
in comparison to these differences. This suggests Δ2 and σ to
be essential signatures of breast cancer applications, especially
the cancer margin detection in THz imaging. An analysis in
terms of the classification potential of the model parameters is
exposed in the next section.
III. PARAMETERS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
All 74 human breast samples are fitted by the model (5) using
the described gradient sampling algorithm. The average value
of each model parameter and its standard error in each breast
tissue group is tabulated in Table II. The contrast values in these
parameters between tissue groups suggest their possible application for breast cancer classification. In the following sections,
we shall employ essential statistical measures to analyze the
differences offered by these model parameters, and accordingly
select potential parameters for breast cancer classification.
A. Statistics Analysis
Pearson correlations between the model parameters and tissue histopathology are presented in Table III. The parameter σ
of the mixture model (5) provide the highest correlation −0.75
with the fat percentage of tissue. This negative value of correlation implies that the reduction in the value of σ is proportional
to the increase of fat percentage in the examined samples. Alternately, the correlation 0.75 of σ with tumor content explains
the contribution of increasing neoplasm to the rise of this parameter. In fact, the similarity between fat and tumor in terms of
high correlation with σ represents the nature that tumor has less
adipose tissue and a more homogeneous structure in that respect
as compared to fibrous tissue. One of the recent challenges in
breast cancer detection with THz imaging is that the dielectric properties/optical properties of fibrous tissue and tumor are
similar [8]. In fact, fibrous tissue together with glands and connective duct have a high water content and hence respond to
THz radiation as comparably as cancerous tissue does [26]. As
a result, it is clinically more apparent to detect tumors buried

in fatty tissues rather than those in fibrous tissues. However,
tumor is still expected to contain more water (up to 20% higher)
than fibrous tissue, which could be essential for distinguishing
between these two types of tissues. In addition, the similarity
between fat and tumor in terms of high correlation with σ represents the nature that tumor has less adipose tissue and a more
homogeneous structure in that respect as compared to fibrous
tissue. Indeed, the significantly higher average value 7.89 of σ
for tumors than the value 4.41 of fibrous tissue can be found
in Table II. In short, σ marks itself a highly prominent feature
for differentiating tumor from fibrous tissue. Despite that we
could not find the correlation between fibrous percentage and
the parameters of model (5), it is worth reminding that Pearson correlation only measures the linear relationship between
two variables. Therefore, the relationship between the model
parameters and fibrous content may be nonlinear and Pearson
correlation is probably not a suitable statistical measure for such
a case.
As the Pearson correlation is to reveal the physical meaning
behind the values of model parameters rather than to directly
analyze the contrast between tissue group, we employ the independent two-tailed t-test with eight parameters of the mixture
model. The specific p-values of the test corresponding to each
pair of healthy tissue and tumor were provided in Table IV.
The parameter σ demonstrates the statistically significant difference between fibrous tissue and tumor with the p-value of
approximately 0, which is considerably lower than the critical
value 0.05 of the t-test. Similar statistical results are also seen
between fat and tumor. While ∞ , Δ2 , Δ3 , σ, τ 1 , τ 2 can
demonstrate significant differences between healthy breast tissue and tumor, only ∞ , σ is capable of specifying the difference
between fibrous tissue and tumor.
B. Classification Potential
Both the Pearson correlation analysis and independent twotailed sample t-test introduce the two parameters Δ3 and σ of
(5) as an advantageous indicator, which is highly sensitive to
histopathology of breast samples. Therefore, an analysis from
the perspective of classification is essential to accurately select
rich features as well as confirm the potential of our modelparameter approach in breast cancer margin detection with THz
imaging. A common technique to explore the sensitivity and
specificity of classifiers in medical community is the ROC plot
[27]. The ROC plots present the tradeoffs between the true
positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR), which is
determined by one minus the specificity. Each operating point
of the plot is identified by a pair of TPR and FPR corresponding
to a threshold of the examined classifier. Fig. 6 demonstrates the
ROC plot for σ as a classifier with its threshold values chosen
by averaging two consecutive test values of σ. For the purpose
of evaluating σ regarding its merit of classification, another
critical index from ROC plots is the area under the ROC curve
(AUROC), which is independent from any specific threshold
and the most useful to generally assess the performance of a
classifier. A value of AUROC close to 1 illustrates that its corresponding diagnosis system has higher sensitivity and specificity. The AUROC values of all eight model parameters were

calculated and recorded in Table V. Particularly, the AUROC of
σ is the highest with the value of 0.93. To the best of our knowledge, this outcome is remarkably higher than the best AUROC
value of up to 0.78 in the literature [28]. Therefore, σ is selected
to be the principal classification feature. The remaining parameters of the model (5) can be considered as supporting features
to improve the classification capability. However, combination
of well-correlated parameters do not facilitate improvement of
classification capability, thus it is necessary to find the independence parameters for the combination. As a result, linear correlations between all eight model parameters were calculated to
determine the independent parameters for classification.
In order to analyze the true classification power of σ and its
combinations, internal or training error rates of these features

with SVM classifiers are employed. One way to estimate the true
error rate is cross validation (CV), which is based on the idea
of repeatedly training a model with a preselected proportion of
data and testing the error rate of the model on the rest of the data
[29]. For the well-known k-fold CV, the data are divided into
k disjoint sets of which each consecutive set is used for testing
the model trained by the remaining partition [30]. The k-CV
value is calculated by averaging the correct classification accuracy over k training-testing times. Due to the small sample size
in this study, LOOCV, the most complicated form of the k-fold
CV, is applied to estimate the true error rate. Indeed, LOOCV
allows using the most of data for training and can provide an
unbiased error rate [31]. The SVM classifiers are applied for
the model parameters and their combinations to determine the
LOOCV values of all these features. The SVM algorithm aims
to detect the decision boundaries between classes in the reduced
dimension feature spaces. This method finds the optimal separating hyperplane with maximal margin between the classes
by iteratively minimizing the objective function of the distance
between support vectors of the classes. In this study, we employ
the SVM classifiers with the MATLAB implementation developed by [32]. The kernel function, radial basic function used
in our classification requires selecting the kernel parameter γ
appropriately. In addition, the penalty parameter C of the error
term in the objective function is also necessary for optimizing the classification. These two parameters are chosen by grid
search to obtain the best LOOCV value. The LOOCV values
of totally eight model parameters and their noticeable combinations are presented in Table VI. As expected, σ has the highest
LOOCV accuracy of 86.49% among eight model parameters.
Based on grouping the parameters, which are not statistically
correlated, the best combination of these parameters is formed
by ∞ , Δ3 , σ with the LOOCV accuracy of up to 93.24%. In
this respect, the significantly higher LOOCV accuracies of the
combinations ∞ , Δ3 , σ, and ∞ , σ reveal their superior classification capability as compared to σ. In short, the outcomes of
LOOCV analysis with the SVM classifier not only confirm the
classification potential of σ but also explore the high feasibility
of improving the accuracy with the combinations of the model
parameters in (5) in THz imaging of breast cancer.

IV. CONCLUSION
The mixed model for complex permittivity of breast tissue at
THz frequencies as given in (5) is proposed for the first time.
The dielectric model (5) is developed based on combining the
non-Debye relaxation theory and the Debye relaxation process
due to the nonexponential dielectric response of breast tissue at
low THz frequencies and the impact of a considerable proportion of water in breast tissue. Our fitting procedure employed
the gradient sampling algorithm for nonoptimization to extract
optimal parameters of the model (5). Simulations prove that our
proposed models can accurately mimic the measured data of
fat/adipose tissue, healthy fibrous, and cancerous breast tissue. A
variety of statistical measures were used to investigate the potential of the parameters of model (5) in terms of unveiling the tissue
histopathology and cancer classification. Our analysis demonstrates two encouraging results: the parameter σ of (5) highly
correlates with fat tissue and tumor percentage of examined
breast tissue samples, which marks this parameter as an indicator for pathology diagnosis; the ROC analysis confirms the more
remarkable discrimination ability of σ to classify breast cancer
as compared to previous studies. In addition, LOOCV values
of the combinations of the model parameters, namely (∞ , σ)
and (∞ , Δ3 , σ), with the SVM classifier suggest these features as the best indicators for discriminating breast tumor from
healthy breast tissue. To recapitulate, these outcomes support
a further step toward understanding the dielectric responses of
breast tissue to THz radiation as well as applying the parameters
of model (5) into THz imaging for breast cancer detection.
Future study will consider direct classification on more THz
images in order to confirm the accuracy of breast cancer margin detection. Moreover, the empirical model (5) also requires
more specific elaboration on physical process underlying the
non-Debye dielectric response of breast tissue in the future.
Knowing the best way to describe the dielectric properties, we
will be able to apply the finite-difference time-domain techniques using the proposed model to simulate the interaction of
THz radiation with breast tissue. Therefore, we can recognize
the theoretical differences in pulse shape between normal and
tumor tissue as well as improve our understanding of how normal tissue changes its response due to tumorigenesis. This will
be beneficial to deal with heterogeneous tissue, which includes
both characteristics of tumor and normal. A THz intraoperative
probe has been developed that can perform measurements in reflection geometry during breast cancer surgery; the outcomes of
this study will facilitate choosing classification features in the
pulse shape of the reflected signal collected using this probe.
Furthermore, successfully modeling the dielectric response of
breast tissue with the model (5) implies that the low THz frequency range is the most accountable for producing the data to
classify breast cancer. Applying the low frequencies for a prac-

tical THz imaging system, mainly THz pulse imaging or single
frequency THz Imaging, leads to a sacrifice in spatial resolution
since the minimum size of tumor identifiable by THz needs to be
larger. For instance, 1 THz generally has a spatial resolution of
around 300 micrometer. Consequently, the application of THz
imaging is limited to sampled areas larger than this size.
