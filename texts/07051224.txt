Performance Analysis of Network Model to Identify
Healthy and Cancerous Colon Genes
Tanusree Roy, Student Member, IEEE, and Soma Barman, Member, IEEE

Abstract—Modeling of cancerous and healthy Homo Sapiens
colon gene using electrical network is proposed to study their behavior. In this paper, the individual amino acid models are designed
using hydropathy index of amino acid side chain. The phase and
magnitude responses of genes are examined to screen out cancer
from healthy genes. The performance of proposed modeling technique is judged using various performance measurement metrics
such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, etc. The network model
performance is increased with frequency, which is analyzed using
the receiver operating characteristic curve. The accuracy of the
model is tested on colon genes and achieved maximum 97% at
10-MHz frequency.
Index Terms—Colon cancer, electrical network, genomics, modeling, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, simulation.

I. INTRODUCTION
HE high throughput technological advances such as microarray and mass spectrum technology are used to study
the cancer associated genes and proteins, which eventually lead
to breakthroughs in cancer research [1]. For the classification of
normal versus cancer samples, various data-driven methods are
proposed by researchers. But using these methods, it is difficult
to describe the biological system without model. Therefore, accurately prediction of cancer associated gene is still a significant
challenge for oncologists as well as computational biologists.
Colon cancer is one of the uncontrolled genetic diseases,
which cause half of the million deaths in every year [2]. It
results from the accumulation of mutations in genes and affects
growth-controlling genes [3], [4]. Many types of cancer are
accompanied by significant changes in amino acid metabolism
due to the demands of tumors [5], [6]. The role of amino acid in
cancer disease is investigated using electrical model of amino
acid string [7]. In [8], a comparative analysis based on hexamers
in promoter region is studied to differentiate skin cancer and
normal genes.
In recent years, researchers are interested in developing network model for the biological system. For example, passive
electrical circuits are developed to study protein structure [9].
The PSpice model is implemented to examine the electrical
conductivity of the DNA [10]. Impedance network is realized
to study conformational change in protein structure [11], and it
is also proven from various literature surveys that the property

and structure of the DNA is very important for the VLSI chip
and nanobiosensor design [12]. But these model-driven methods are mostly nucleotide based [13], which becomes incredibly
complex with high computational load. Whereas, realizations of
network models based on amino acid, i.e., group of three nucleotides become more sensitive and less complex in predicting
genetic abnormalities [14].
The authors in this paper have realized electrical network for
effective prediction of Homo Sapiens colon genes (long amino
acid chain), which will be more appropriate in the present era
of nanotechnology considering complexity and computational
load. The objective of the paper is twofold.
1) Realization of network model for Homo Sapiens colon
genes [15], downloaded from the National Institutes of
Health Government web site [16] and GeneCards website
[17] and investigation of the model response to study the
gene behavior.
2) Judgment of network model performance and robustness
using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and
measurement parameters, i.e., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity on 33 colon gene samples.
II. METHODS
The proposed technique can be applied on colon genes, which
are collected from biological samples, e.g., purified DNA, cell
line, and blood sample [18] available as soft databases in public
domain. The technique is described in steps as following:
1) first, the whole genome sequence sample is collected from
the National Institutes of Health Government web site
[16];
2) the individual amino acids are converted into electrical circuit model and cascaded in series to design gene network,
i.e., amino acid chain network;
3) the transfer function model of gene network is obtained
and analyzed to study the gene behavior;
4) the simulated frequency responses are studied to identify the sample databases associated with cancerous and
noncancerous gene.
The procedure is illustrated in detail in the following sections.
A. Electrical Circuit Modeling of Amino Acid
The model of gene is used to reveal the molecular changes
in genome that are associated with disease. The gene model
based on amino acid is very significant to predict human genetic
diseases. There are 20 amino acids [19] composed of amine
(NH2 ) and carboxylic acid (COOH) functional groups (together known as a backbone structure), along with a side-chain

group (r); which are attached with central alpha carbon atom
specific to each amino acid shown in Fig. 1(a).
The central alpha carbon atom is common for all amino acids;
whereas, the amino acid structure varies with backbone (only
for amino acid Proline) and side chain (for all 20 amino acids).
Therefore, the circuit modeling concept is emphasized on backbone and side chain only. The generalized electrical circuit
model for a single amino acid composed of two distinct circuits,
i.e., backbone circuit and side chain circuit, which are connected
in parallel to each other. The impedance of the backbone is Zb
and side chain (r) is ZSC [see Fig. 1(b)].
In present network model, the backbone is represented by
resistor R (7 Ω) as it is comprised of total seven atoms, i.e.,
four atoms from carboxyl group (COOH) and three atoms from
amino group (NH2 ). The backbone of Proline is represented by
R of 6 Ω as amino group (NH) has two atoms. Depending on
the polarity of side chain, amino acids vary in their hydrophilic
or hydrophobic character. The side chains of hydrophobic and
hydrophilic amino acids are represented by inductor L and capacitor C, respectively. The values of L and C are selected based
on the hydropathy index value [20] of individual amino acid
[see Fig. 1(c) and (d)].
B. Electrical Network Modeling of Gene (Amino Acid Chain)
The n numbers of amino acids are joined together in series
to model gene (see Fig. 2). The gene network consists of distributed and lumped elements (RC and RL), which are arranged
using Foster-type topology [21]. The electrical circuit for amino
acid chain of length three is obtained by attaching three amino

acid models to each other. The cascading process of the circuit
elements is carried out to obtain the generalized expressions
for electrical impedance of amino acid chain of any length.
The equivalent impedance for amino acids length of one to any
arbitrary length n is given by

According to [22], any linear electrical network with any
combination of single frequency sinusoidal ac sources and
impedances can be replaced by single voltage source, i.e.,
Thevenin or equivalent voltage and a single series impedance,
i.e., Thevenin or equivalent impedance. In this paper, the
gene structure is converted into an equivalent single electrical network, where the impedances are replaced by equivalent

The present modeling concept is tested on 33 known gene
sample databases (17 cancerous and 16 healthy Homo Sapiens
colon samples) from Cancer Genome Anatomy Project [15],
NCBI site, i.e., National Institutes of Health government web
site [16] and GeneCards website [17]. The network model phase
and magnitude responses at different frequencies are considered
to study and identify the behavior of cancerous and healthy genes
(see Tables I and II). The MATLAB (R2009b type) environment
is used for network realization and simulation.

hydrophobic amino acids are realized by RL parallel circuit [see
Fig. 1(d)]. Therefore, our network realization is truly matched
with the biological features of cancer and healthy genes at higher
frequency.

The normalized phase values (i.e., phase values / 360 )
of gene network are measured using Bode analyzer within
100-Hz–10-MHz frequency range. The simulated results (see
Fig. 5) for most of the cancer genes exhibit negative phase (see
Table I), which indicates dominance of hydrophilic amino acids
in cancer genes [23] and we model hydrophilic amino acid by
RC parallel circuit [see Fig. 1(c)]. Whereas most of the healthy
genes exhibit positive phase (see Table II), indicates healthy
genes are mostly made up of hydrophobic amino acids and the

Bode analyzer is used to simulate the magnitude response
of the gene model. The normalized magnitude responses (i.e.,
magnitude values/max magnitude value) are categorized into
four different classes by setting different threshold values (in
decibel) as all the values are positive in nature, depicted in
Table III. It is observed from the simulated magnitude response,
most of the class D genes, i.e., possibly cancer genes and most
of the class A genes, i.e., possibly healthy genes are truly be
predicted at higher frequency as in Fig. 6. Therefore, from the

C. Colon Gene Prediction by Performance Evaluation Metric
and ROC analysis
Therobustness of the model is measured in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, etc. In phase analysis, the negative
and positive phase values for genes are denoted by “T” and
“F,” respectively. For magnitude, the classifier is categorized as
class “A,” “B,” “C,” and “D.” The decisions of the genes to be
predicted are made using decision matrix (see Table IV), and
manifested in Tables V and VI.
Since ROC analysis occupies an increasingly important role
in disease diagnosis [24], we consider ROC to judge network
model performance. Only the true positive rate (TPR) or sensitivity and false positive rate (FPR) or (1-specificity) are required
to draw the ROC curve [25], [26].

The gene model performance for predicting genes can be
quantified by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC)
as in (10). The ideal value of AUC is 1, whereas a random guess
value of AUC is 0.5. When the value of AUC is less than 0.5,
indicates wrong prediction [27], [28].
The performance evaluation metrics at different frequencies
are reported in Table VII and manifested in Fig. 7. The results
in Fig. 7(a) and (b) reveal that maximum numbers of colon
genes are correctly identified as cancer or healthy at frequency
10 MHz, which is the optimum frequency for all genes. The
ROC curves in Fig. 7(c), demonstrate that the model has AUC
of 0.97 for 10-MHz frequency.

10-MHz frequency for prediction of normal and malignant colon
genes.

In [13], the DNA structure is designed using a nucleotidebased network model, which increases complexity with high
computational time and less accuracy. But in this study, aminoacid-based network modeling is proposed, which is new, simple,
straightforward, and improves accuracy as well as reduces computational load.
The performance and computational time of the proposed
technique is compared with the previously published nucleotidebased network modeling technique in Table VIII. In this context, the technique [13] is implemented in MATLAB and evaluated on the same public gene sample databases at 10-MHz
frequency. The results reveal that the proposed, i.e., amino-acidbased network modeling technique yields better classification
results compared to nucleotide-based modeling techniques. The
proposed technique achieved the accuracy of 97% for classification of the genes, which is 48.52% better compared to the
accuracy achieved by the previous technique [13]. In case of
the computational load, the proposed method requires 90.19%
lesser time (10.2 times faster) than the nucleotide-based method.
Therefore, we can conclude that the proposed technique is better
for accurate identification of normal and malignant colon gene
sample databases compared to previous techniques.
IV. CONCLUSION

D. Cancer Diagnosis Using Electrical Responses
The frequency responses, i.e., bode phase and magnitude responses within [100 Hz–10 MHz] frequency range are used as
measurement metrics to identify the gene samples associated
with cancerous and healthy tissue. The genes associated with
cancerous activity are identified based on the key feature, i.e.,
“dominance of hydrophilic amino acid composition in cancerous genes” [23], which is shown by the phase response (see
Fig. 5) of gene model (negative phase for cancer and positive
phase for healthy genes). The observed magnitude responses
(see Fig. 6) are also used for accurate prediction of the genes as
cancerous and noncancerous genes. The classifier is designed
based on magnitude response, where larger magnitude (class
D > 2.7 dB) indicates cancer and smaller magnitude (class
A < 2.3 dB) indicates healthy genes. Finally, both the phase

The authors have realized an amino-acid-based electrical
model of gene to identify the characteristics of Homo Sapiens
healthy and cancerous genes associated with colon. A putative
connection between biological features and electrical responses
is established through network modeling of genes. The proposed model is proved better than the nucleotide-based electrical
model in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and computational time. The phase and magnitude at different frequencies are
used as measurement metrics to study the behavior of genes. According to medical research reports, the amino acids Arginine,
Glutamine, Aspartate, Glutamate, and Serine are hydrophilic in
nature and identified as signature candidate for cancer disease.
The simulated phases manifest the dominance of hydrophilic
amino acids in cancer genes compare to healthy genes, which is
taken as key feature in this study, and truly reflect the medical

research report. The network model performance achieved high
accuracy of 97% at 10-MHz frequency. The proposed modeling
concept is used here as prediction tool to identify normal or abnormal colon genes. This concept can be extended in future for
investigation of other kinds of cancerous genes such as prostate,
breast, lung, ovarian, etc.
