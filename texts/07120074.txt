Representing Variability and Transmural Differences
in a Model of Human Heart Failure
Mohamed M. Elshrif, Member, IEEE, Pengcheng Shi, and Elizabeth M. Cherry

Abstract—During heart failure (HF) at the cellular level, the
electrophysiological properties of single myocytes get remodeled,
which can trigger the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias that
could be manifested in many forms such as early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and alternans (ALTs). In this paper, based on experimentally observed human HF data, specific ionic and exchanger
current strengths are modified from a recently developed human
ventricular cell model: the O’Hara–Virág–Varró–Rudy (OVVR)
model. A new transmural HF-OVVR model is developed that incorporates HF changes and variability of the observed remodeling.
This new heterogeneous HF-OVVR model is able to replicate many
of the failing action potential (AP) properties and the dynamics of
both [Ca2 + ]i and [Na+ ]i in accordance with experimental data.
Moreover, it is able to generate EADs for different cell types and
exhibits ALTs at modest pacing rate for transmural cell types. We
have assessed the HF-OVVR model through the examination of the
AP duration and the major ionic currents’ rate dependence in single myocytes. The evaluation of the model comes from utilizing the
steady-state (S-S) and S1-S2 restitution curves and from probing
the accommodation of the HF-OVVR model to an abrupt change in
cycle length. In addition, we have investigated the effect of chosen
currents on the AP properties, such as blocking the slow sodium
current to shorten the AP duration and suppress the EADs, and
have found good agreement with experimental observations. This
study should help elucidate arrhythmogenic mechanisms at the
cellular level and predict unseen properties under HF conditions.
In addition, this AP cell model might be useful for modeling and
simulating HF at the tissue and organ levels.

ORE than 15 million Americans suffer from coronary
heart disease in the U.S. One-third of them suffer from
heart failure (HF) and ∼280 000 die yearly [1]. HF is characterized by decreased contractility and an inability of the ventricles

to pump enough blood to the body. At the cellular level, HF
is accompanied by remodeling of the ion channels that govern
the electrical activity of the heart. During HF, the electrophysiology and the associated arrhythmogenesis mechanisms are
altered and this alteration depends on the etiology that led to HF
[2]. Therefore, HF cannot be represented by a fixed set of electrophysiological changes. However, there are a number of consistent findings thought to be important for arrhythmogenesis.
These include ion channel remodeling, altered calcium homeostasis, and increased accumulated sodium concentration [2],
[3]. Many experimental studies observed altered ionic currents
and exchangers in failing human ventricular myocytes [4]–[14].
Moreover, noninvasive measurements have confirmed differences in membrane potential and calcium dynamics between
failing and nonfailing human hearts [4], [5], with potentially
proarrhythmic implications [6], [7].
Recently, O’Hara et al. [15] developed a new ventricular AP
cell model [O’Hara–Virág–Varró–Rudy (OVVR)] under normal
conditions and were able to reproduce many important physiological properties, such as action potential duration (APD) restitution curves. However, the model was not extended to pathological conditions, e.g., HF. Therefore, Mathematical modeling
of disease-specific electrical activity of human ventricular cells
is a powerful tool that complements the fundamental physiological understanding of remodeling of ionic channels under
specific diseases, such as HF, which is observed by experimentalists and can be used to predict complicated situations. There
are a few HF ventricular cell models that have been developed
for humans [8]–[10], [14], [16], [17], [19]–[24] and different animal species such as canines [11], [12], rabbit [18], and guinea
pigs [13]. These models did not include experimentally verified
variability in parameter values for the ionic currents and [Ca2+ ]i
dynamics for cardiac myocytes of the particular species. Therefore, we developed a failing human ventricular cell model using
observed variability in ionic current strengths. This new HFOVVR model is a natural extension of our previously published
model [25] for the action potential and calcium dynamics in
failing human ventricular myocytes with model improvements,
which fall into two categories. First, the new model includes
transmural cell types [26], [27]. This will help us to investigate how the heterogeneous remodeling under HF modulates
the electrophysiological properties that may lead to arrhythmias
[28]. Second, we introduce uncertainties in modified parameter values, which may represent the averages from different HF
causes or the variability between isolated myocyte samples from
the investigated subject, remodeling ion channel strengths without changing the ionic current kinetics. Therefore, the simulated
HF population is constructed by incorporating the upregulation

or downregulation of transmembrane current conductances as
observed in experiments (see Table II).
In the present study, first, the electrophysiological activity
of a transmural single myocyte was simulated using welljustified modifications of a recent mathematical model of the
human ventricular AP [15] to replicate the experimentally
reported human HF phenotypes. Second systematic and quantitative variability in ionic currents and exchangers was introduced utilizing experimental observations published in the
literature.
II. RELATED WORK
There are several simulation studies [8]–[14], [16]–[24] that
aimed to simulate remodeled AP properties during HF. The
adapted alterations of the transmembrane currents from these
simulation studies are summarized in Table I. We will explain
the remodeled currents of these HF models and the impact of
each altered current on the HF model.
For the fast sodium current IN a , most previous HF simulation
studies on a single myocyte [8], [10]–[13], [16]–[18], [20], [22],
[23] did not consider remodeling INa in their HF models, except
a few studies that consider a reduction of INa [9], [14], [21]
by ↓57%, 34%, and 40%, respectively. In addition, one study
[19] considered scaling INa by 25–200% from the control value.
Reducing INa will affect the amplitude as well as the upstroke
velocity of an action potential.
Regarding the late sodium current INaL , the preceding simulation studies [8], [11], [13], [14], [16]–[18], [20], [21] did
not consider remodeling INaL in their HF models. However,
more recent HF simulation studies [9], [10], [12] [19], [22],
[23] believed that remodeling the INaL plays a dominant role
in changing AP characteristics during the plateau and repolarization phases, and as a consequence, this current could alter
the duration of an AP. INaL is remodeled in these simulation
studies through increasing the peak current density 12-fold in

[9], 2-fold in [10], 6.7-fold in [12], 0.25-2-fold in [19], 2-fold
in [22], and 10-fold in [23].
The former simulations of HF cell models did not consider altering the L-type calcium current ICaL [8], [10]–[14], [17]–[19],
[21]–[23], except three studies [9], [16], [20] that remodeled
ICaL by ↑200%, ↑↓30%, and ↑150%, respectively.
Previous HF simulation studies show agreement regarding the
transient outward current Ito . Most of these studies reduced Ito
in human by ↓33% [17], ↓36% [9], [14], [20], [23], ↓40% [22],
↓60% [10], and ↓64% [21]. For animal species, Ito is reduced
by ↓36% [18] in rabbit, ↓66% and ↓84% in canine [11], [12],
and ↓66% in guinea pig [13] myocytes. Two HF models did
not change Ito [8], [19]. One study [16] perturbed Ito in both
directions by ↑↓30%.
Most of the existing simulation studies follow the findings that
show downregulation of the inward rectifier potassium current
IK 1 by implementing a reduction of IK 1 density between ↓25%
and 68% in their HF models [8]–[13] [14], [17], [18], [20]–
[23]. Two HF studies [16], [19] used the same IK 1 as in normal
conditions.
Surprisingly, none of the previous simulation studies [8]–
[14], [17]–[23] considered remodeling the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current IK r in their HF cellular models to investigate the effects of this current on AP characteristics. Only
one study [16] considered investigating the effect of IK r by
↑↓30%.
Similarly, most previous HF simulation models [8], [10], [11],
[13], [18]–[20], [22], [23] did not investigate remodeling the
slow delayed rectifier potassium current IK s . However, there
are a few studies [9], [12], [14], [16], [17], [21] that integrated a
reduction of IK s within the range ↓30–50%. One study [9] did
not specify the percentage reduction in IK s density used in the
paper.
In addition, many HF studies [10]–[14], [17], [18], [20]–[23]
remodeled the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium SERCA activity
ranging from ↓24% to 85%, along with one study [9] which did

not specify the percentage of reduction. One study [19] scaled
SERCA by 25–200% from the original value. In addition, one
study [16] considered perturbing SERCA activity by ↑↓30%.
One sole study [8] did not consider remodeling SERCA.
On the contrary, most of the preceding HF simulation models realized the importance of incorporating remodeling of the
sodium calcium exchanger INaCa . Therefore, an upregulation
was incorporated with a broad range of ↑36% to 200% in these
HF models [8]–[14], [17], [18], [20]–[22]. One study [16] perturbed INaCa by ↑↓30%. Also, two studies [19], [23] did not
consider remodeling this current in their HF models.
For the sodium–potassium pump Na+ /K+ , some of the HF
cellular models incorporated remodeling INaK through reducing
its conductance (GNaK ) by ↓10% [8] and ↓42% [9], [10], [21].
One study [23] chose to use the range of these previous studies,
↓10–42%. In addition, one study [22] remodeled INaK by ↓90%,
while the rest of the HF models [11]–[14], [16]–[20] did not
remodel this pump.
Regarding background currents, most of the previous HF
models did not change the sodium background current INab ,
except one study [23], which increased INab 16-fold. However,
some of these HF studies [8], [9] altered the calcium background
current ICab by ↑25%, while studies [10], [22] altered this current by ↑153%. One study [21] did not specify the percentage
of remodeling ICab .
For Ileak , many of the previous HF models [8], [9], [11]–
[14], [16], [18], [19], [21], [24] did not consider remodeling this current. However, a few studies [10], [17], [20],
[22], [23] increased this current with disparate percentages
of ↑500%, 300%, 30%, 300%, and 350%, respectively. In
addition, two studies [17], [21] considered remodeling the ryanodine receptor (RyR), but with opposite direction of remodeling. One study [17] incorporated an increase of RyR activity by
↑300%, while [21] considered a reduction of RyR activity by
↓50%.
Concerning remodeling heterogeneous cell types, most of the
previous HF models [8]–[11], [13], [14], [16]–[21], [23] remodeled a single cell type, except for two studies [12], [22], which
considered remodeling three transmural types of cells. One of
these studies [12] did not remodel the statistical difference be-

tween cell types during HF as observed experimentally, instead,
it used the same remodeling parameters setting across all types
of cells. In addition, the other [22] considered remodeling only
two types of ionic currents: INaCa and ISERCA .
Most importantly, most of the previous HF models [8], [9],
[11]–[14], [17], [18], [20]–[23] incorporated a fixed set of remodeled current, exchanger, and pump parameter values without
introducing any kind of uncertainty to the remodeling parameters. However, a few studies [10], [19] considered different ways
of including uncertainty. One study [19] scaled the sarcoplasmic
reticulum calcium uptake current Iup by 25–200% as well as the
time constants of fast and slow sodium channel inactivation τh,j
by the same scale. In addition, Trenor et al. [10] performed a
sensitivity analysis of ionic currents by ±15% to assess the sensitivity of electrophysiological biomarkers to changes in ionic
current properties. Another study [16] generates a population
for both normal and HF cellular models through perturbing the
GCaL , Gto , GK 1 , GK r , GK s , GNaCa , and Jup ionic parameters
by ±30%.
III. METHODS
A. OVVR Cellular Electrophysiology Model Description
In this study, the following differential equation was used to
describe the time-dependent electrophysiological behavior of a
single normal myocyte [15]:
dVm /dt = −(Iion + Istim )/Cm

(1)

where Vm is the transmembrane voltage; t is time; Iion is the
total of all transmembrane ionic currents, pumps, and exchangers; Istim is an external stimulus current; and Cm is the cell
membrane capacitance. Furthermore, Iion can be represented
by the following equation:
Iion = INa + INaL + ICaL + ICaK + IK 1 + IK r + IK s
+ Ito + INaCa + INaK + INab + ICab + IK b + IpCa .

This original undiseased OVVR model was evaluated through

an action potential in a single myocyte based on data from more

than one hundred normal human hearts. In addition, it presents
new formulations for unavailable measurements of ICaL , potassium currents, and INaCa . However, the model was not formulated to investigate disease-specific situations such as HF, which
is our aim in the present manuscript.

B. Developed HF-OVVR Cellular Electrophysiology
Model Description
Certain ionic exchanger and pump currents were investigated
with their corresponding experimental human HF data published
and remodeled based on these observations. We used the same
equations of the normal OVVR model [15] and reformulated
the maximum current conductances for major currents of the
undiseased OVVR model [15], while other values remained unchanged, such as the background currents. We take the first
steps toward developing a meaningful representation of population variability through calculating the mean and the standard
deviation (SD) for each ionic current across experimental observations found in the literature. Table II summarizes the heterogeneous remodeled ionic currents used in our HF-OVVR model
along with the data sources. The details of HF remodeling for
each current we are discussed below.
1) Fast sodium current (INa ): This current is activated during the depolarization phase of an AP, which is responsible for upstrokes during the normal impulses in a single myocyte. Most experimental studies on HF-affected
myocytes show that the peak INa is decreased in a range
from ↓39.3 ± 6.5% to ↓91.1 ± 9.3% [29]–[31], except
for one study [75], which indicates that the peak INa is
unchanged from normal levels. We calculated the mean
(μ) and SD of observed remodeling of INa in cardiomyocytes isolated with these recent experimental studies
[29]–[31]. In our simulations, we use (μ ± 2SD) to
express the range of variations. Fig. 1(a) shows the simulated reduction of the INa .
2) Late sodium current (INaL ): The participation of this current is during the plateau and repolarization phases, not
during the depolarization phase of an AP due to its slow
dynamics. Most experiments on HF human myocytes
[29], [32]–[34] show that the INaL density is increased
within a range from ↑30.0 ± 0% to ↑238.5 ± 1.3%.
However, one study [76] showed similar INaL densities
in failing and normal hearts, although the small sample
size did not allow a statistically significant comparison.
Therefore, we computed the average of these experimen-

tal observations in human HF myocytes from [29], [32]–
[34] considering the variation between these studies.
L-type calcium current (ICaL ): This current plays an essential role in shaping the AP morphology, especially in
the long plateau phase. Also, it initiates the excitationcontraction coupling. The majority of previous HF observations report that there is no significant difference
between ICaL in failing and non-failing myocytes [35]–
[45]. However, one study [51] observed a decrease in the
dihydropyridine binding sites within a range from ↓35%
to 48% and mRNA by ↓47%. We decided to use the same
ICaL density as in nonfailing myocytes as reported by
most of these experiments for all cell types.
Transient outward potassium current (Ito ): This current
impacts the notch portion during the rapid phase 1 repolarization of an AP. It is agreed across most experimental observations on human ventricular species that Ito is
decreased with a range from ↓26.4 ± 1.3% to ↓73.2 ±
5.8% under HF conditions [39], [42], [45]–[50], [77].
However, these studies claim that there is no significant change in the kinetics of Ito in failing myocytes
when compared with non-failing myocytes. Therefore,
we chose to incorporate a downregulation of Ito under
HF conditions heterogeneously. This means that different outward potassium conductance settings (Gto values)
are used to model the transmural heterogeneity of cardiac ventricular cells based on the previous experimental
observations [45], [49], [50], [77] for epicardial cells,
[39], [42], [46], [47], [50] for midmyocardial cells, and
[48]–[50], [77] for endocardial cells. As a consequence,
Ito is reduced by ↓40.4 ± 8.7%, ↓37.6 ± 3.3%, and
↓50.8 ± 2.0% for epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cell types, respectively.
Inward rectifier potassium current (IK 1 ): IK 1 plays
a significant role in stabilizing the resting membrane
potential (RMP) and in shaping the last portion of the
repolarization phase of an AP [78]. Observations from
numerous studies have shown that IK 1 is significantly
downregulated within a range from ↓40 ± 0% to ↓64 ±
0% [39], [42], [45], [46], [51]–[54]. Hence, we adopted
a reduction of the peak IK 1 by reducing its conductance
(GK 1 ) heterogeneously, after calculating the mean and
SD, by ↓55.3 ± 13.9%, ↓52.7 ± 14.8%, and ↓55.0 ±
16.1% for epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial
cell types, respectively. The transmural remodeling is
based mainly on the experimental observations from
[39], [45], [51], [52] for epicardial, [39], [46], [51], [52]
for midmyocardial, and [39], [51], [52] for endocardial
cells.
Rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IK r ): IK r
plays an important role in the repolarization phase of
an AP. This current has been studied extensively with
controversial observations. Many experiments observed
a reduction within a range from ↓27.3 ± 1.7% to
↓51 ± 0% [50], [54]–[56], but some studies [42], [45],
[79] indicated that IK r is unchanged. This controversial
observation is due in part to the cell type investigated.

Therefore, we decided to incorporate remodeling of this
current based on the cell type, due to the differences in
the shape and duration of APs between these cells, by
↓45.9 ± 9.5% for epicardial cells [50], unchanged for
midmyocardial cells [42], [45], [79], and ↓27.3 ± 1.7%
for endocardial cells [50]. The simulated IK r current
traces are shown in Fig. 1(b).
Slow delayed rectifier potassium current (IK s ): IK s is a
slow activating current that affects the last portion of repolarization of an AP. Most of the former studies show an
agreement on the downregulation of IK s within a range
from ↓49.5 ± 1.6% to ↓61.7 ± 1.4% [45], [54], [57].
Only one study [80] exhibits that the KCNE1 mRNA
increases by ↑25%. We decided to follow the majority
of the previous experimental observations through reducing the peak current density of IK s heterogeneously
by ↓59.4 ± 2.1% [45], [57], ↓49.5 ± 1.6% [57], and
↓57.7 ± 2.2% [57] for epicardial, midmyocardial, and
endocardial cell types, respectively.
Sodium–calcium exchanger current (INaCa ): INaCa supports regulating the intracellular calcium concentration.
Many experimental observations on the myocardium
of HF patients found that the measured activity of the
Na+ /Ca2+ exchanger is modified with a wide range
from ↑80.0 ± 0% to ↑200.0 ± 0% compared to nonfailing myocytes [58]–[61], [81]. Therefore, a homogeneous
upregulation of INaCa by ↑131.4 ± 62.8% for all different cell types is incorporated into the undiseased OVVR
model, which includes both the membrane INaCai and
subspace INaCas s . Fig. 1(c) exhibits the simulation results of the modified INaCa .
Sodium–potassium pump current (INaK ): INaK maintains the RMP and ionic homeostasis inside the cell. The
majority of experimental studies report that Na+ /K+
pump activity is downregulated within a range from
↓36 ± 0% to ↓56 ± 0% [62]–[66]. One study [82], observed a non-significant decrease of ↓10%. We decreased
the peak of INaK homogeneously by ↓40.2 ± 15.5% in
our HF-OVVR cellular model.
Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ (SERCA) pump: This
pump transports calcium ions from the cytosol into the
SR. Most of the experimental observations claim that
an alteration of [Ca2+ ]i in failing human and animal
myocytes is based on the dynamics of the SR Ca2+

pump, which is decreased in a range from ↓15.4 ± 0% to
↓50.0 ± 0% [5], [27], [61], [67]–[74]. [Ca2+ ]i under
HF conditions is characterized by a reduction of calcium levels during the systolic phase, an elevation of
calcium levels during the diastolic phase, and prolongation of calcium levels during the relaxation phase. We
decided to incorporate a remodeling of SERCA in our
HF-OVVR model through decreasing the SERCA activity heterogeneously by ↓41.3 ± 12.5% [5], [27], [61],
[67], [68], [71], [72], ↓42.3 ± 11.3% [27], [61], [67],
[68], [71], [72], [74], and ↓41.1 ± 10.1% [5], [27], [61],
[67], [68], [71]–[73] for epicardial, midmyocardial, and
endocardial cell types, respectively.
C. Experimental Data
1) Data sources: Most of the sources of experimental data
used to construct and simulate human HF myocyte are
based mainly on human species. However, due to the
scarcity of data on humans for some currents during HF,
we benefit from the existence of data from other animal
species found in the literature. Therefore, we incorporated canine [54], [57], [79] and rabbit [55], [56], [78]
data.
2) Data variability: Data for the HF-OVVR model are
presented as the mean ± SD (μ ± SD). We calculate
 the SD in this manuscript based on the formula
σ12 + σ22 + · · · + σn2 , where σi2 is the variance of the
instance i and n is the number of experiments involved in
the calculations of the specified remodeling current.
3) Biomarkers calculation: We varied each modified
parameter from (μ + 2SD) to (μ − 2SD) in increments
of 1 SD and calculated the biomarkers for each varied
parameter value. For each biomarker, the minimum and
maximum biomarker values obtained over all parameter
variations and over all currents are given as the range
in Table III.
D. Measurement of Restitution Curves and Accommodation
In order to study how the cycle length (CL) perturbation
affects the ventricular APD, two common protocols were implemented: steady-state restitution (S-S), and S1-S2 restitution,
along with probing the accommodation of APD to a single
change in CL. For every protocol, we generated APs using a
current strength twice diastolic threshold at a CL of 1000 ms.
APDs were assessed by measuring the repolarization voltage
thresholds corresponding to 90% (APD90 ) and 50% (APD50 )
after pacing for 1 min at the corresponding CL.
For the steady-state protocol, the targeted myocyte was stimulated for 1 min beginning from a CL of 1000 ms, after which
the CL was decreased in steps until 2:1 block was observed. For
every CL, the last APD and the prior diastolic interval (DI) pair
were recorded. However, when the targeted myocyte exhibited
alternans (ALTs) during pacing process, the last two DI and
APD were registered.
For the S1-S2 protocol, the intended myocyte was stimulated
for 1 min with a constant CL, which is known as S1, after which

The pacing CL=1000 ms. + Downsweep pacing protocol was used starting from CL=1000 ms. ∗ For EADs, the pacing protocol begins at
CL=2000 ms.

a second stimulation (S2) was used after a variable DI. The last
pair of DI and APD were recorded. The amplitude of short-term
memory (STM) was computed as the variation between APD
values for the maximum DI at the highest S1 CL, which is in
our simulations 1000 ms, and the lowest S1 CL before block or
ALTs was noticed [83].
In addition, we adapted a protocol for measuring the accommodation of APD to an abrupt change in CL, since this protocol was recommended as a clinical marker for arrhythmia risk
[84]. We follow the same procedure from the preceding studies
[85], [86] to construct the accommodation curve by recording
APD90 at a CL of 1 s after pacing for 8 min, after which the CL
was abruptly decreased to 600 ms for a similar pacing period
(8 min). Then, the CL was restored to 1 s for another 8 min
pacing period (for more details, see [25] and [87]).
In addition, it is worth mentioning that the stable steady-state
is difficult to achieve when implementing cellular models. We
paced the HF-OVVR cellular model for 5 min at a fixed CL
after which we measured the difference between the last two
consecutive APDs and found it to be 10−4 ms.
E. Numerical Algorithms
Time derivatives were integrated uniformly using the explicit
Euler method to solve the ordinary differential equations of the
AP and concentration dynamics of the cellular model. The integration of the ionic gating variables was implemented using the
Rush and Larson method [88]. The time resolution used for the
HF-OVVR was 0.02 ms, with the calcium equations integrated
with a smaller time step of 0.001 ms. All single-variable functions were pre-computed and saved in lookup tables [89] to reduce the computational time. Action potentials were stimulated
using a transmembrane stimulus current 32.0 μA/μF for 2.0 ms.

All simulations were written in Fortran 95, visualized using
MATLAB, and run on a MAC Pro 2×2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel
Xeon CPU with 32-GB 800-MHz DDR2 FB-DIMM RAM. It
took 1.3 min to simulate 60 s of physical time and performing the
whole simulation for each cell type under one set of conditions
took 2.2 h.
IV. RESULTS
A. HF Simulation of an AP in Transmural Cells
Fig. 2 depicts the transmural simulated APs of the normal
OVVR model (dotted green lines) and HF-OVVR model (solid
black lines) for epicardial (a), midmyocardial (b), and endocardial (c) cell types at CL 1000 ms. As shown in the left panel of
Fig. 2, the HF settings of the OVVR model diminish the spikeand-dome morphology of an epicardial AP and the plateau is
increased. In addition, APD90 is increased due to the slow repolarization dynamics. Similar behavior is observed in the failing midmyocardial cell type (see the middle panel of Fig. 2),
where APD90 is increased. Some HF population cases exhibit a
two-phase repolarization, which also has been observed experimentally [37]. For the failing endocardial cell type (see the left
panel of Fig. 2), the maximum amplitude is unchanged, but the
AP gets delayed due to the reduction of IN a for all of the HF
population. Table III summarizes all the extracted biomarkers
of the OVVR model under undiseased and HF conditions for
heterogeneous cell types.
B. Rate Dependence of APD and Major Currents
An important role in excitation is the adaptation of an AP to
changes in pacing CL. As illustrated in Fig. 3(a) and (b), the APs
of the HF-OVVR model exhibit stronger rate dependence than

(columns 1 and 3) and HF-OVVR (columns 2 and 4) models for CLs of 1000 ms (solid black), 800 ms (dashed green), 600 ms (dashed red), 400 ms (dashed blue),
and 350 ms (dashed purple). The HF-OVVR model generally shows more rate dependence; however, the normal OVVR model shows greater rate dependence for
IK s and [Ca2 + ]i . The inset bar diagrams indicates the peak values for each specific curve (a) Normal OVVR Ep (b) HF-OVVR Epi (c) Normal OVVR Epi (d)

APs of the OVVR model. For ICaL , the HF-OVVR also exhibits
stronger rate dependence than the OVVR model. However, the
maximum amplitude in the HF-OVVR is two times larger than
in the OVVR model for all CLs; see Fig. 3(c) and (d). Due
to the reduction of SERCA, the systolic calcium amplitude is
reduced and contributes to the slow diastolic decay of calcium,
which induces more calcium influx during the AP plateau phase.
Similar rate adaptation is observed for INaCa , where the HFOVVR model possesses stronger rate adaptation than the OVVR
model, as shown in Fig. 3(e) and (f). Regarding IK 1 , both models
exhibit limited rate dependence, as depicted in Fig. 3(g) and (h),
but the OVVR model possesses maximum values larger than
the HF-OVVR model by ∼100%. For IK r , both models show
limited rate dependence with the HF-OVVR model peak current
values smaller than the OVVR model by ∼50% for all CLs; see
Fig. 3(i) and (j). For IK s , the OVVR model exhibits larger rate
dependence than the HF- OVVR model. As shown in Fig. 3(k)
and (l), the maximum value is increased as the CL is decreased
for the OVVR model, but it is slightly decreased for the HFOVVR model before it is increased at shorter CLs. In contrast,
the HF-OVVR model has stronger rate dependence for INaL than
the OVVR model at shorter CLs; see Fig. 3(m) and (n). Both
models exhibit large rate dependence of the calcium transient
for all CLs, as shown in Fig. 3(o) and (p). However, the OVVR
model has a peak calcium value four times larger than that of
the HF-OVVR model.

C. Restitution Curves and STM
Fig. 4 (dashed lines) shows S1-S2 APD restitution curves
for a range of S1 CLs for the HF-OVVR model. These S1-S2
curves are superimposed with S-S APD restitution curves. All
HF-OVVR restitution curves decrease monotonically with CL.
Also, all transmural cell types exhibit STM with the midmyocardial cell possessing the largest STM = 23.6 ms, and the
epicardial cell having the lowest, STM = 14.7 ms. The endocardial cell falls in between with STM = 20.9 ms. Fig. 5 exhibits the time course (24 min) of APD adaptation to an abrupt
decrease and increase of CL for both the normal OVVR and
HF-OVVR models. When accommodating to a decrease in CL,
the HF-OVVR model for the epicardial cell type has two phases
of accommodation. In the first phase, the APD has a rapid decrease and increase in the AP duration followed by slow decay
until it reaches a steady state. However, for the normal epicardial
cell type of the OVVR model, the APD is consistently decreasing. Similar behavior was observed for accommodation to an
increase in CL; see Fig. 5.
D. Alternans
ALTs occurs for all three types of cells of the HF-OVVR
model, but with a different ALTs window and magnitude. For
epicardial cells [see Fig. 6(a) and (b)], the ALTs onset occurs at a
CL of 400 ms and lasts to a CL of 350 ms with a maximum ALTs

amplitude of ∼30.0 ms. As shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d), which
represents the midmyocardial cell, the ALTs window is 420–600
ms with ∼36.0 ms maximum APD90 difference. The endocardial cell type, as depicted in Fig. 6(e) and (f), has the lowest
ALTs amplitude (∼22.0 ms) along with the lowest ALTs onset
CL of 380 ms. The ALTs window falls between 270 and 380 ms.
E. Early Afterdepolarizations (EADs)
Usually, ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death are
associated with HF [90], and EADs are thought to play a major
role in the initiation of arrhythmias. As depicted in Fig. 7, the
HF-OVVR model favors the occurrence of EADs because of the
prolongation of APD90 , shown here for a CL of 1000 ms. This
APD90 prolongation is caused by both ICaL and INaL , which
lengthen the plateau phase and allow the late calcium current to
reactivate. When preventing ICaL recovery or blocking INaL in
the HF-OVVR model, EADs were suppressed.
F. Comparison With Previous HF Models
In this section, we compare HF biomarkers of the HF-OVVR
model with previous HF simulation studies:
1) AP duration at 90%: APD90 in [8], 548.8 ms, increased
by 46.7%; in [9], 273.0 ms, increased by 22.9%, 369.0 ms,
increased by 44.1%, and 338.0 ms, increased by 50.2%
for epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cell types,
respectively; in [10], ∼470.0 ms, increased by 24.0%; in
[11], 500.0 ms, increased by 66.7%; in [12], 600.0 ms, increased by 106.9%; in [17], increased by ∼30.0%; in [20],
increased by 562.5 ms; in [21], increased by ∼45.0%; in
[22], increased by ∼ 400.0 ms for epicardial and endocardial cell types in one of their HF model; and in [23], 350.0
ms, increased by ∼18.0%. Two studies [16], [18] measured different repolarization thresholds; [16] calculated
APD80 and had a population median increased by 19.6%,
while [18] computed APD75 and found 215.0 ms increased by ∼30.0%. In our HF-OVVR model, the variability of parameters covers these APD prolongations, where
APD90 increased within a range from 306.9 to 590.7 ms

(33.6–157.2%), 392.8 to 628.8 ms (13.9–82.3%), and
352.2 to 512.2 ms (34.3–95.3%) for epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cell types, respectively.
2) AP duration at 50%: Two studies [8], [10] quantified
APD50 , where in [8] quantified APD50 with a measured
value 374.5 ms, increased by 20.7%; in [10] increased by
18.0% from normal level. For the HF-OVVR model, the
APD50 ranges were increased by 249.0–436.9 ms (32.7–
132.9%), 318.3–466.4 ms (13.2–65.8%), and 277.7–373.1
ms (33.8—79.7%), for epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cell types, respectively.
3) AP triangulation: For triangulation, a sole study [10]
quantified it and found an increase of 43.0%. In our HFOVVR model, the ranges are increased by 57.9–153.8
ms (37.5—265.3%), 74.5–162.4 ms (16.9–154.9%), and
74.5–139.1 ms (19.8–154.3%), for epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cell types, respectively. In addition, Walmsley et al. [16] measured the median population
and found an increase ranging between 7.0% and 10.0%.
4) Calcium transient dynamics: The peak value of [Ca2+ ]i
was 334.0 nmol/L as reported by [8] with a reduction of 45.6% from the normal level. [12] found that
the amplitude was 580.0 μM with a decrease of 22.7%
from the normal peak. [10] measured that the amplitude was reduced by 41.0% from the normal model.
Shannon et al. [17] found a reduction in the calcium
peak levels under HF without quantifying it. Puglisi
and Bers [18] found a decrease less than 40.0%. In
our HF-OVVR model, the peak value of [Ca2+ ]i falls
within a range increased by 193.3–627.8, 255.7–793.6,
and 267.5–352.3 μM, for epicardial, midmyocardial, and
endocardial cell types, respectively. One study [12] measured the time to peak [Ca2+ ]i as 420.0 ms, increased by
460.0%, while our ranges increased by 44.7–175.5, 47.6–
181.7, and 64.9–168.5 ms, for epicardial, midmyocardial,
and endocardial cell types, respectively. The diastolic
steady-state was reported by [8] with a value of 136.0
nmol/L increased by 13.3%; our HF-OVVR model obtains values of 82.1–89.3, 94.1–96.8, and 94.8–99.1μM,

for epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cell types,
respectively. The time to reach steady state for [Ca2+ ]i is
630.0 ms, increased by 39.7%, as reported by [10]. Walmsley et al. [16] measured the median calcium transient peak
value, duration, and triangulation for the whole population and found a reduction of 44.4%, increase of 51.7%,
and reduction of 11.6%, respectively. Another study [21]
found that [Ca2+ ]SR under HF conditions is reduced by
15.0% in store because the restoring rate is slower.
5) Sodium dynamics: For [Na+ ]i accumulation, Trenor et al.
[10] observed an increase in levels compared with a normal model. Also, Moreno et al. [23] found that the intracellular sodium concentration level was 11.45 mM, increased by ∼28.7%. In our HF-OVVR model, the peak
[Na+ ]i values are increased by 2.6–15.6%, 6.1–15.9%,
and 5.3–18.7% for epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cells, respectively.
6) Induction of EADs: For EADs, only one HF simulation
study [10] reported that EADs can be induced. As shown
in Fig. 7, our HF-OVVR can induce EADs. Table III
indicates the EADs CLs range and APD90 in the EADs
regime for all cell types.
V. DISCUSSION
In this paper, we present a human HF model (HF-OVVR)
derived from experimental observations on remodeling of ion
channels mainly from human data and for comparison use the
undiseased ventricular cell model (OVVR) [15]. Our new HFOVVR model can reproduce many of the AP properties of
failing human myocytes. We have compared the properties of
the HF-OVVR model with available experimental observations
and found good agreement. We have found that APD90 is prolonged by 77.2–361.0, 47.8–283.8, and 89.9–249.9 ms for epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cells in our model,
which agrees with experimental observations of ∼181 ± 28
ms prolongation for the HF case [45]. In addition, we found
that APD50 is prolonged by 61.4–249.3, 37.0–185.1, and 70.1–
165.5 ms during HF for epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cells, which are close to experimental findings of ∼156
± 22 ms at a CL of 2000 ms [45].
We defined AP triangulation as the difference between APD90
and APD50 and found that our simulated AP triangulation was
comparable with experimental studies [37], [91]. Also, experiments showed a nonsignificant increase in the RMP ranging

between 0.2 and 1.0 ms [92], which is in agreement with the 0.0–
1.3, 0.1–1.8, and 0.1–1.4 ms increases in RMP for epicardial,
midmyocardial, and endocardial cells in our HF-OVVR model.
In addition, the dynamics of simulated [Ca2+ ]i match experimental findings, including decreased systolic amplitude (SA)
range 10.0–72.3%, 23.0–75.2%, and 12.3–33.4% for epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cells in our HF-OVVR
model compared to a reduction of 41% in experiments [37],
[93]. Also, previous experiments observed a slight increase in
diastolic [Ca2+ ]i [91], which matches our simulation results,
which increased by 6.5–15.8%, 1.4–4.3%, and 8.5–13.4% for
epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cells, respectively.
The difference between the SA of [Ca2+ ]i in HF and normal
cells has been observed to be 379 ± 140 nM [8], which is in the
range of the difference observed for our HF-OVVR model of
69.6-504.1 and 237.4–775.3 nM for epicardial and midmyocardial cells. The difference of the upstroke time or time to peak
for the Ca2+ transient is 20 ± 11 ms for a CL of 3000 ms [94],
whereas in our HF-OVVR model, it is 3.2–134.0, 15.3–149.4,
and 9.5–113.1 ms for epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cells, respectively. [Na+ ]i is increased in HF-OVVR cells
for all stimulation rates when compared with the normal cell,
which matches previous findings [95].

quantitative manner. Most of the previous models, [8], [12], did
not consider remodeling INa in reproducing the reduction in the
upstroke velocity of HF cells. Also, these models either did not
remodel the INaL [8] or increased it more than has been observed
[12]. Moreover, previous simulation studies did not incorporate
remodeling of Ito and IK r . Previous simulation studies [8], [12]
did not change these currents. Regarding APD rate dependence,
only one study [9] compared with control at a fast rate.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

Fig. 7. Mechanisms for EADs of the HF-OVVR model for the epicardial cell
type. (a) AP traces. (b) IC a L . (c) IN a L . (d) INaCa under normal (solid green
lines), HF (solid red lines), and blocked IN a L (dotted blue lines) with CL=
1000 ms.

Our approach includes some limitations. Recent work on
mRNA [16] has shown that ALTs in human HF cells begins
at a CL of 350 ms, whereas ALTs in our case is higher by
50, 250, and 30 ms for epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cells, respectively. However, ALTs onset CLs are in the
range of the observed values reported in other studies [96] of
≤500 ms for epicardial and endocardial cells. In addition, in
our simulation results, we observed that the maximum range of
APD S-S restitution curve slopes is 0.26–0.60, 0.23–0.70, and
0.28–0.86 for epicardial, midmyocardial, and endocardial cells,
respectively. For epicardial and midmyocardial, it is less than
the slope value of 0.86 ± 0.12 measured in the LV free wall
of the failing human heart [3] for epicardial and midmyocardial
cells, but it matches the measured endocardial cell.
In addition, to build the HF-OVVR model that was used in
this paper, the experimental data come from various sources of
previously published studies. The data for each study have various HF causes, and we do not have access to the raw data of
these studies. Therefore, in our HF-OVVR simulations, we calculated the mean of the means of these studies and the SD as the
square root of the squared sum of the variances of these studies.
This would not represent uncertainty arising from different HF
causes; instead, it is averaging of the variability within each of
these studies across different HF causes.
On comparing our model with previous HF simulation models
[8], [12], we found that many of those models did not reproduce
as many of the properties of HF that are observed in a single
human HF-remodeled myocyte, such as leveraged accumulated
[Na+ ]i , ALTs, and EADs. These models were designed to reproduce the two prominent properties: prolonged APD90 and
altered [Ca2+ ]i dynamics. Also, these studies used more limited
data and did not show most of the HF-remodeled properties in a

In the present study, first, a simulation study of an AP waveform of different ventricular cell types was presented based on
recent experimental studies of transmural electrophysiological
heterogeneities in the HF-OVVR model and compared with the
normal OVVR model. Second, we evaluated how major cellular
ionic currents influence the AP repolarization phase and how
the APD rate dependence changed in transmural cells. Third,
we found that these results are in good accordance with experimental findings reported in the literature and might motivate
further research on remodeling and simulation of HF at both
tissue and the whole organ levels. In conclusion, the HF-OVVR
model established in this paper was mainly used to investigate
the transmural electrophysiological heterogeneities of different
ventricular cell types in failing human hearts. In future work,
we intend to investigate our model’s properties in tissue, including conduction velocity, and to determine how HF remodeling at
the cellular level could affect the spatiotemporal dynamics of induced arrhythmias in realistic heart geometries. In addition, the
inclusion of CaMK in the model will facilitate investigating how
drug-induced alterations in ionic current and exchanger properties may modulate the electrophysiological properties in HF.
