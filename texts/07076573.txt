Abstract—Biomedical implantable sensors transmitting a variety of physiological signals have been proven very useful in the
management of chronic diseases. Currently, the vast majority of
these in-body wireless sensors communicate in frequencies below
1 GHz. Although the radio propagation losses through biological
tissues may be lower in such frequencies, e.g., the medical implant communication services band of 402 to 405 MHz, the maximal channel bandwidths allowed therein constrain the implantable
devices to low data rate transmissions. Novel and more sophisticated wireless in-body sensors and actuators may require higher
data rate communication interfaces. Therefore, the radio spectrum
above 1 GHz for the use of wearable medical sensing applications
should be considered for in-body applications too. Wider channel
bandwidths and smaller antenna sizes may be obtained in frequency bands above 1 GHz at the expense of larger propagation
losses. Therefore, in this paper, we present a phantom-based radio
propagation study for the frequency bands of 2360 to 2400 MHz,
which has been set aside for wearable body area network nodes,
and the industrial, scientific, medical band of 2400 to 2483.5 MHz.
Three different channel scenarios were considered for the propagation measurements: in-body to in-body, in-body to on-body, and
in-body to off-body. We provide for the first time path loss formulas
for all these cases.
Index Terms—Body area network (BAN), implantable, in-body,

the exceptions since multiple applications of radio technologies have had a beneficial impact on the way diagnosis and
therapeutic procedures are performed [1]. In the same vein, the
use of radio communications combined with biomedical sensors for the continuous monitoring of patients suffering from
chronic diseases has gained significant attention as these solutions promise to lower the global expenditure in healthcare
[2]–[4]. The interconnection of such wireless biomedical sensors to form a body area network (BAN) has been standardized
in IEEE Std 802.15.6-2012 [5], which specifies the physical
(PHY) and medium access control layers for communication on
the surface, inside, or in the peripheral proximity of the human
body. According to this standard, wearable BAN nodes can communicate in existing industrial, scientific, medical (ISM) bands,
as well as other frequency bands approved by national medical and/or regulatory authorities. These include the frequency
band of 2360–2400 MHz [6], [7], which the United States Federal Communications Commission has set aside for medical
wearable sensors in order to complement the already crowded
2400–2483.5-MHz ISM band (simply referred to as the 2.4GHz ISM band). However, as specified by IEEE Std 802.15.62012, in-body BAN nodes can communicate in the medical
implant communication services (MICS) band only, i.e., 402–
405 MHz [7]–[10]. Although the expected radio propagation
losses through biological tissues in the MICS band may not be
as high as within 2360–2400 or 2400–2483.5 MHz, the maximal
channel bandwidth of 300 kHz allowed in the MICS band constrains the implantable devices to low data rate transmissions.
Therefore, a number of other frequency bands have been considered for communication interfaces with medical implants and
in-body electronic pills [11]–[13]. Wider channel bandwidths
for novel and more sophisticated in-body wireless sensors and
actuators may be exploited in frequency bands above 1 GHz at
the expense of larger propagation losses. Despite this drawback,
the feasibility of using the radio spectrum above 1 GHz for inbody BAN applications should be investigated because utilizing
higher frequencies can also reduce the physical dimensions of
implantable antennas that may facilitate the further miniaturization of in-body BAN nodes. For instance, some of the 39 channels of 1-MHz bandwidth available in 2360–2400 MHz could
be employed for implant communications besides their intended
application as on-body radio interfaces; 79 similar channels are
available in the 2.4-GHz ISM band [7]. The idea of using the
spectrum around 2.4 GHz for communication with in-body BAN
nodes has been proposed before, and a variety of implantable
antennas for this purpose have been designed, e.g., [14]–[24]. In

addition, propagation losses of body implanted antennas were
computed via numerical simulations with single- and three-layer
tissue structures for the different ISM bands, namely 433, 915,
2450, and 5800 MHz in [25]. However, no mathematical formulas for the path loss (PL) were provided in that study. On the
other hand, numerical and experimental PL investigations with
ingested wireless implants in 402, 868, and 2400 MHz were
presented in [26]. A log-distance PL formula as a function of
the propagation distance d was introduced for the in-body to onbody (IB2OB) channel scenario. In this model, the PL exponent
γ, which indicates the rate at which the PL increases with d had
a value of 2.8 and 2.6 for data obtained from phantom measurements and numerical simulations at 2.4 GHz, respectively. Likewise, measurements in a phantom and numerical simulations of
PL for insulated dipole antennas in the ISM band at 2.457 GHz
led to PL formulas for the in-body to in-body (IB2IB) channel
scenario [27], [28]. In spite of all these research efforts, no comprehensive set of PL models stemming from measurements or
simulations in a single propagation medium for all the possible
channel scenarios involving in-body BAN nodes has been reported in the literature. Therefore, to fill this gap, we present a
radio propagation study for 2360–2500 MHz, which covers the
two frequency bands discussed previously with potential use for
implant communications. We performed channel measurements
in a liquid phantom, i.e., a chemical solution specially formulated to reproduce the dielectric properties of human muscle
tissues [29]. We considered three different channel scenarios:
IB2IB, IB2OB, and in-body to off-body (IB2OFF). We provide
for the first time the PL formulas for all these cases.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the experimental setup and measurement
methodology. Section III presents the PL formulas for the different in-body channel scenarios. In Section IV, we discuss the
implications of our findings for the implementation of implant
communications in 2.36–2.5 GHz. Finally, Section V summarizes our conclusions.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND MEASUREMENT
METHODOLOGY
A. In-Body Channel Scenarios
The in-body channel scenarios that we considered herein
combined the three possible locations of BAN nodes that the
Channel Modeling Subgroup of IEEE Std 802.15.6-2012 identified in [30]. Hence, these in-body channel scenarios can be
described as follows.
1) IB2IB, a link between two implanted nodes.
2) IB2OB, a link between an implanted node and a node in
direct contact with the skin or within 2-cm distance.
3) IB2OFF, a link between an implanted node and a node
beyond 2 cm and up to 5 m from the body surface.
Nevertheless, because of the limitations imposed by the physical size and construction of the phantom, the channel measurements were performed with the best possible approximation to
the characteristics of each scenario.

Fig. 1. Components of the measurement setup for the IB2IB channel scenario.
Note that in this case the two implantable antennas were located along an
imaginary diagonal line that divided the phantom in two triangular halves. This
was done in order to obtain a larger transmission range. However, in the other
two cases, i.e., IB2OB and IB2OFF, an implantable antenna and the helical
antenna were located along an imaginary line that divided the phantom in two
rectangular halves.

B. Experimental Setup
The setup used for the IB2IB measurements is shown in
Fig. 1, which consisted of a vector network analyzer (VNA),
a cube-shaped container, phantom aqueous solution, two insulated dipole antennas, and two coaxial cables. For the IB2OB
and IB2OFF measurements, one of the insulated dipoles was
replaced with a free-space coax fed helical antenna with a dielectric support on a finite ground plane and six turns of copper
wire. This free-space helical antenna exhibited a reflection coefficient of |S11 | < −10 dB within 2.36–2.5 GHz and a gain of
7.7 dB at 2.4 GHz. The physical dimensions of these antennas
are shown in Fig. 2. The antennas were connected to an Agilent Technologies ENA E5072A VNA, which had a maximal
operation frequency of 8.5 GHz. Two coaxial cables of 1 m in
length with a maximal operation frequency of 12.4 GHz were
used to connect the antennas to the VNA ports 1 and 2, respectively. The cables’ frequency response was subtracted from the
channel measurements by performing a careful thru-calibration
of the VNA. Further details about some components of this
measurement setup are given below.
C. Phantom Aqueous Solution
In order to approximate the propagation conditions of the
human body within 2.36–2.5 GHz, an aqueous solution of sucrose (C12 H22 O11 ) and sodium chloride (NaCl) was prepared.
Reportedly, a solution with the following weight proportions:

chloride, approximates the dielectric characteristics of human
muscle tissues at 2.45 GHz, i.e., relative permittivity εr = 52.7
and conductivity σ = 1.73 S/m [24]. However, slight changes
in these dielectric parameters may occur because of ambient
temperature variations. The prepared solution was poured into
a cube-shaped container made of extruded polystyrene foam
(Styrofoam) with wall thickness wth of 40 mm. The container’s
size was 30 × 30 × 20 cm3 (width × length × height), and
the phantom solution occupied a volume of 22 × 22 × 16 cm3 .
Hereinafter, we refer to this arrangement as “the phantom.”
D. Insulated Dipole Antennas
The insulated dipoles were designed with arms made of a
perfect electric conductor material surrounded by an insulation
made of polytetrafluoroethylene (εr = 2.07 and σ = 0 S/m)
[27], [28]; in the physical implementation [see Fig. 2(a)], however, the arms were made of copper. These antennas were originally designed to resonate at 2.457 GHz when submerged in a
phantom solution with εr = 50.8 and σ = 2.01 S/m. However,
through measurements of the reflection coefficient, i.e., |S11 |
parameter, we verified that the insulated dipoles covered properly the 2.36–2.5-GHz frequency band when submerged in our
liquid phantom described previously (see Fig. 3).

Fig. 4.

E. Measurement Methodology

A. IB2IB Channel Scenario

The measurements consisted of obtaining the forward channel gain in the frequency domain, i.e., S21 (f ), within the band
under analysis. Measurements were performed between 2.36
and 2.5 GHz with N = 20001 resolution points; thus, the frequency resolution was Δf = 7 kHz. The VNA output power
was set to 10 dBm and the noise floor was at −110 dBm within
a bandwidth fIF = 3 kHz. All the measured data were recorded
for processing and analysis in MATLAB. Five snapshots of the
channel were recorded to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The

In this scenario, the two insulated dipoles were submerged
in the phantom so that the center of each antenna was located
at 8 cm of depth aligned vis-à-vis in a copolarized mode. An
antenna was fixed at a distance of 4 cm from the phantom’s
internal edge, whereas the second one was moved away from
a starting distance d = 20 mm up to d = 140 mm in steps of
10 mm (see Fig. 4).
The respective discrete scatter plots of PL (di ) for the frequency bands of 2.36–2.4 and 2.4–2.5 GHz are shown in Fig. 5.

Measurement setup for the IB2IB channel scenario.

PL in decibel was then calculated as PL = −mean {S21 (f )}.
For each channel scenario, a discrete number of PL points versus
the corresponding distance separating the antennas, i.e.,PL (di ),
were plotted, and a continuous curve was fitted to the resulting
scatter plot. The least-square fitting method was then used to
produce a PL formula as a function of distance.

in [27] and [28], where IB2IB PL formulas valid for 5 ≤ d ≤ 80
mm were introduced.

IB2IB scatter plots of PL for 2.36–2.4 and 2.4–2.5 GHz.

B. IB2OB Channel Scenario
In this scenario, one insulated dipole was submerged in the
phantom, whereas the helical antenna [see Fig. 2(b)] was facing
it at the same height in direct contact with the external phantom’s
wall. We denoted the distance from the insulated dipole to the
phantom’s internal wall as din . Note that in this case, the effective
distance separating the two antennas in millimeters including the
phantom’s wall thickness wth is
d = din + wth .

(2)

However, we measured the PL through the 40-mm-thick Styrofoam wall and found it to be negligible; therefore, one can
assume that
PL (din ) ≈ PL (d) .
Fig. 6.

IB2IB scatter plot and fitted curve of PL for 2.36–2.5 GHz.

As seen, the difference in PL between these two bands is negligible for all the considered distance points. Therefore, in order to
produce a PL formula, the channel measurements were averaged
over the entire frequency range of 2.36–2.5 GHz. The resulting
scatter plot and fitted curve for 2.36–2.5 GHz are shown in
Fig. 6.
In this case, the mathematical model (fitted curve) for the PL
in decibel as a function of d in millimeters is a linear equation
given as
PL (d) = PL0 + αd

(1)

where PL0 is an initial PL value in decibel observed in the limit
when d → 0, and α is a scaling factor. Here, PL0 = 11.9 dB and
α = 0.7 dB/mm. This model is valid for 20 ≤ d ≤ 140 mm. For
the interval 20 ≤ d ≤ 80 mm and similar dielectric properties
of the propagation medium, this model is in good agreement
with the channel simulation and measurement results reported

(3)

In a real-life IB2OB scenario, where a wearable sensor is
in direct contact with a patient’s skin, din = d and (3) may
become PL (din ) = PL (d). Thus, the helical antenna was kept
fixed, whereas din was varied by moving the dipole away in
steps of 10 mm as shown in Fig. 7. The scatter plot and fitted
curve as a function of din for 2.36–2.5 GHz are shown in Fig. 8.
A linear equation of the same form as (1) is a good model for the
PL in this case too, with PL0 = 29.7 dB and α = 0.6 dB/mm.
This model is valid for 10 ≤ din ≤ 80 mm.
Note that for the same distance value, a larger PL is observed
in the IB2OB channel scenario when compared to IB2IB. This
additional loss is a direct result of the impedance mismatch
caused by the change of propagation medium along the propagation path [31]–[33].
C. IB2OFF Channel Scenario
The measurement setup for the IB2OFF scenario is similar
to that of IB2OB, but here the insulated dipole was fixed at
a distance din as in the previous scenario, whereas the helical
antenna was moved away from the phantom. We denoted the
distance from the phantom’s internal wall to the helical antenna

as doﬀ (see Fig. 9). We considered three different fixed values
for din : 10, 20, and 30 mm. For each of these cases, we put
the helical antenna at multiple locations so that doﬀ varied from
40 to 540 mm. The resulting scatter plots and fitted curves as
functions of doﬀ for 2.36–2.5 GHz are presented in Fig. 10.
In this scenario, the fitted curve for the PL in each case follows
a log-distance formula expressed in decibel as

where γ is a PL exponent and dref is a reference distance equal
to 1 mm. The subscript din in (4) indicates that the formula
is valid for one of the three specific values of din considered
herein; the corresponding values of PL0 and γ for these three
cases are given in Table I.
As expected, in this scenario, the wave propagation through
the aqueous phantom solution was the largest contributor to the
total PL along d. This can be observed by comparing Figs. 8 and
10, where it is evident that the rate at which the PL increases
with distance is significantly lower in the air. As hinted in [30],
the PL in the IB2OFF channel scenario can be approximated

The set of PL formulas presented above are aimed to provide
some insight into the behavior of the different in-body channel
scenarios to assist the biomedical engineer in the early stage
of the design of wireless implantable sensors. It is clear that
these PL models are antenna dependent as the vast majority
of other BAN propagation models proposed in the literature.
As the wavelength of the propagating signal in the phantom
aqueous solution is λ = 17 mm, some of the measurements
were inevitably performed within the reactive near-field of each
dipole antenna, the boundary of which is R = 36 mm. However,
implantable and free-space antennas with |S11 | < −10 dB were
used in all the channel scenarios to try to counter as much
as possible the antenna effects on the PL. Although channel
measurements in a homogeneous propagation medium like an
aqueous phantom solution do not fully capture the effects of
propagation through inhomogeneous multilayer structures like
the human body, they provide practical rules of thumb to assess
the feasibility of establishing reliable communications for some
implantable biomedical applications within 2.36–2.5 GHz.
For instance, consider the ultralow power radio system
for BAN applications designed in [34], which can operate in
2.36–2.4 and the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The transmitter (Tx) of
this system utilizes a basic on–off keying modulation scheme
with 0 dBm peak power. Including the Tx baseband, the Tx

CHÁVEZ-SANTIAGO et al.: EXPERIMENTAL PATH LOSS MODELS FOR IN-BODY COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN 2.36–2.5 GHZ

power consumption is 4.243 mW when transmitting a logical
“1” and 0.919 mW for a logical “0.” The receiver (Rx) front
end achieves a sensitivity of −75 dBm at 5 Mb/s and −78 dBm
at 3 Mb/s. Therefore, if this radio system is equipped with
properly matched implantable/on-body antennas accordingly,
the maximal transmission range that may be attained for the
different in-body scenarios can be estimated with the PL
formulas we provided.
From (1), it follows that for IB2IB, the maximal transmission range of this BAN system is 90 and 94 mm for 5 and
3 Mb/s, respectively. These transmission ranges are suitable for
some communication applications in the thoracic cavity, e.g.,
wireless sensing for a subcutaneous implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (s-ICD) [35], [36]. An implanted cardiovascular
pressure monitor integrated with a medical stent [37] could send
an alert signal on a wireless interface within 2360–2483.5 MHz
to the s-ICD in order to deliver transthoracic shocks when ventricular tachyarrhythmias are detected.
Similarly, for IB2OB, the maximal transmission range is 75
and 80 mm for 5 and 3 Mb/s, respectively. These transmission
ranges represent the maximal implantation depths from the skin
for the wireless sensors. Hence, applications like the insertableloop recorder [38] and continuous glucose monitoring systems
[39] could also benefit from smaller antenna sizes by using radio
interfaces within 2360–2483.5 MHz. Since these applications
utilize a subcutaneous wireless sensor, i.e., a sensor implanted
just under the patient’s skin, the transmission range could likely
be extended to IB2OFF for communication with a hand-held
patient assistant unit to display, analyze, and record the physiological data. On the other hand, the above transmission ranges
for IB2OB within 2360–2483.5 MHz may not fulfill the transmission range requirements for some electronic pill applications like the wireless capsule endoscope (WCE) [11]. In this
biomedical application, the transmission range varies widely as
the WCE travels inside the gastrointestinal tract transmitting
images to a belt receiver/recorder that the patient has to wear
during the entire endoscopic procedure (approximately 8 h). An
average transmission range of 200 mm is typically required for
a WCE procedure, but up to 500 mm may be needed in some
cases. Therefore, practical solutions like the use of a matching
layer and spatial diversity reception that have been studied in
the context of ultrawideband WCE [40]–[42] should be also
investigated for 2360–2483.5 MHz.
Nevertheless, the designer of an implantable communication
link using our PL models has to take into account the fact that
miniaturized implantable antennas may not be so well matched
to the medium as the dipoles used in our measurements. Implantable antenna mismatch and other varying factors like the
different thicknesses of fat layer of the patients require the addition of a link budget margin to the PL calculation. The value
of such margin is generally determined based on practical prototype tests.
V. CONCLUSION
We have presented a collection of PL models for 2.36–
2.5 GHz derived from measurements in a liquid phantom that

935

reproduced the dielectric characteristics of human muscle tissues. These results provide useful insight into the behavior of
the different radio channel scenarios for implant communications. However, the fact that the measurements were performed
using a homogeneous propagation medium leaves some room
for improvement. Therefore, our future work considers the performance of in vivo channel measurements in an animal subject.
Such a measurement campaign will allow capturing the effects
of blood circulation, respiration, and temperature gradients on
the PL for the different in-body channel scenarios, which are
not properly modeled in most cases; even numerical simulations
using digital anatomical models often fail to capture these effects. From the experience gained after multiple in vivo tests of
implantable radio transceivers at the Intervention Centre, Oslo
University Hospital [43], [44], we have concluded that channel measurements on a living porcine subject can produce PL
formulas that fairly approximate the propagation characteristics
in the human torso. It will be necessary, however, to perform
the measurements using various types of antennas with significantly variable sizes in order to fully validate the parameters of
the formulas presented in this paper.
Our current PL models for the different in-body channel scenarios indicate that radio interfaces within 2.36–2.5 GHz are
feasible for some implantable biomedical sensors. The use of
these frequency bands can promote further miniaturization of
the antennas, a very important design aspect for biomedical
implants. At the same time, wider channel bandwidths will be
available for the transmission of larger amounts of physiological data. The design of radio transceivers for implants operating
within 2.36–2.5 GHz will be a part of our future research activities too. Optimal transceiver design, however, calls for more
accurate characterization of the different in-body radio channel
scenarios. Hence, this study could contribute to spark further
research interest toward the exploitation of this portion of the
spectrum for implant communications.
