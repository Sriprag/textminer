Objective Assessment of Upper-Limb Mobility
for Poststroke Rehabilitation
Zhe Zhang, Qiang Fang∗ , Member, IEEE, and Xudong Gu

Abstract—The assessment of the limb mobility of stroke patients
is an essential part of poststroke rehabilitation. Conventionally,
the assessment is manually performed by clinicians using chartbased ordinal scales, which can be subjective and inefficient. By
introducing quantitative evaluation measures, the sensitivity and
efficiency of the assessment process can be significantly improved.
In this paper, a novel single-index-based assessment approach for
quantitative upper-limb mobility evaluation has been proposed
for poststroke rehabilitation. Instead of the traditional humanobservation-based measures, the proposed assessment system utilizes the kinematic information automatically collected during a
regular rehabilitation training exercise using a wearable inertial
measurement unit. By calculating a single index, the system can efficiently generate objective and consistent quantitative results that
can reflect the stroke patient’s upper-limb mobility. In order to verify and validate the proposed assessment system, experiments have
been conducted using 145 motion samples collected from 21 stroke
patients (12 males, nine females, mean age 58.7±19.3) and eight
healthy participants. The results have suggested that the proposed
assessment index can not only differentiate the levels of limb function impairment clearly (p < 0.001, two-tailed Welch’s t-test),
but also strongly correlate with the Brunnstrom stages of recovery
(r = 0.86, p < 0.001). The assessment index is also proven to
have great potential in automatic Brunnstrom stage classification
application with an 82.1% classification accuracy, while using a
K-nearest-neighbor classifier.
Index Terms—Dynamic time warping, mobility assessment,
rehabilitation, stroke.

I. INTRODUCTION
TROKE is the leading cause of long-term disabilities in the
world, and is known to cause various body functioning impairments from muscle weakness to cognitive deficits [1]–[3].
By 2007, there are 62 million stroke survivors worldwide and
55%–75% of them suffer from various degrees of body functioning impairment [4], [5]. Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular
disease caused by haemorrhage or infarction-induced cerebral
blood-supply interruption. The impairment of central nervous
system suppresses the cerebral electrical activity, and thus, results in loss of various body functions depending on the location
of the lesions. Despite the irreversible damage to the brain tissue,

it is possible to partially regain the body functions via brain’s
ability of reorganizing itself in response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli [6], and poststroke rehabilitation plays an important
role in shaping the neurological changes during this remodeling
process and maximizes the positive outcomes [1], [7].
One of the major objectives of poststroke rehabilitation is to
improve patient’s motor functions, as it is critically related to the
ability of independent living [8]. During movement related training, limb mobility evaluation are considered essential, as they
provide important information about patients’ recovery progress
and training effort, which can be used by the clinicians as the
base to individualize the rehabilitation interventions and provide
feedback to the patients to improve their training performance.
The impairments of stroke can affect stroke patient’s motion on
more than just muscle strength and dexterity. The upper motor
neuron lesion can lead to imbalanced excitatory and inhibitory
input to alpha motor neurons and cause abnormal muscle excitability or spasticity, which can impose a significant limitation
on patient’s motion [9]. An obligatory synergy pattern caused
by the neurological disorder can also be observed, when stroke
patients struggle to perform voluntary isolated joint movements.
Poststroke rehabilitation training exercises are designed to work
against these specific patterns, and stroke patient’s limb mobility can be evaluated based on their motion quality with respect
to their ability of adhering to predefined position targets and
trajectories.
Conventionally, clinical evaluations are manually performed
by experienced clinicians using chart-based ordinal scales, such
as Brunnstrom stage of recovery [10], [11], Fugl–Meyer assessment (FMA) [12], Barthel Index[13], and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [14]. Apart from the shortcoming
of inefficiency, the lack of consensus is also a limitation of the
conventional evaluation methods, which makes the comparison of patient’s data across different institutes and regions very
difficult. In 2001, World Health Organization presented the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health
(ICF) to serve as a comprehensive assessment framework that
is designed to be used uniformly around the world. However,
the implementation of ICF is also hindered by the subjective
nature of the conventional methods, as the evaluation standard
can vary between occasions [15]. A number of researches are
dedicated on comparing different assessment tools [16]–[18],
and the results show that, while many ordinal scales are able
to reliably assess the different aspects of the body function,
they are often limited in terms of sensitivity, and by introducing
interval scale and quantitative measurements, the assessment
outcome can reflect changes more accurately and allows more
meaningful statistical analysis. Therefore, to truly improve the

efficiency, reliability, and sensitivity of limb mobility evaluation
in rehabilitation and realize unified classification standards, an
objective and quantitative evaluation method is required.
In order to develop an objective assessment system, a measure that can automatically gather patient’s motion sample is
required. Nonvisual-based wearable inertial measurement unit
(IMU) motion tracking devices are commonly adopted in rehabilitation training supervision applications, especially in home
or community-based training environments where resources are
limited [19]–[22]. Compared to the visual-based systems, IMU
devices are relatively cheaper, more compact, and easier to setup
and operate. In a series of studies conducted by Cutti et al. [23]–
[25], an IMU developed by XSens Technologies B.V. that integrates accelerometer and magnetometer was adopted in human
kinematics analysis for both gait patterns and upper-limb motions, and the validity and accuracy of measurement of IMUs are
proven in both studies. In [26], a wearable IMU-based system
was implemented to assess the tremor severity of the patients
with Parkinson’s disease. The sensor output was utilized to detect the occurrence of tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia, and
thus, estimate the unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale score.
IMU-based systems are also used in poststroke body function assessment. In [27], wearable accelerometers were used to capture
stroke patients’ motion sample during a wolf motor function test,
and the author was able to estimate FMA score automatically
using the kinematic features extracted from the sensor output,
and thus, proved the validity of using IMU as a sampling tool
for clinical assessment.
Pattern recognition technique also plays a major role in objective clinical assessment. In order to extract valuable information
form the sensor measurement and produce valid results that correlate with medical doctor’s evaluation, regression, and supervised classification techniques are often incorporated. In [28],
linear regression analysis was implemented in a rehabilitation
system that integrates a therapy robot and handheld accelerometer to assess the stroke patient’s motor performance based on
FMA score. In [29], support vector machine (SVM) was used
to classify the severity of Parkinson’s disease. However, these
techniques only provide classification result based on clinical
assessment scales. Therefore, they are also limited in terms of
sensitivity, and cannot be effectively used to generate quantitative feedback in a training session to improve patient’s motion
quality.
This paper proposes a novel single-index-based assessment
system for quantitative evaluation of upper extremity mobility
in poststroke rehabilitation. The proposed measure can serve as
a reliable evidence for unified body function classification to
improve the individualized rehabilitation training or as an intuitive feedback to facilitate patient’s rehabilitation training in
both supervised and unsupervised environment. The evaluation
process employs a constrained dynamic time warping (DTW)based technique to generate objective and consistent quantitative
results to reflect patient’s motion quality in relation to predefined templates, and thus, manifest limb mobility. The validity and reliability of the proposed assessment index have been
tested in an experiment involving stroke patients with various
degree of body function impairment. The patient’s limb function

impairment levels are classified using Brunnstrom stages of
recovery by an expert panel. The statistical difference of the
evaluation results for the patients with different impairment
level, and the correlation between the proposed metric index
and Brunnstrom stages are investigated. The rest of the paper
is arranged as follows: the experiment setup and the algorithms
are introduced in Section II. The results are presented in Section
III and discussed in Section IV. Section V explains the future
works and concludes the paper.
II. METHODOLOGIES
The implementation of the proposed assessment system is
illustrated in Fig. 1. The training motion samples are first collected from both rehabilitation professionals and stroke patients
using a wireless IMU. A fifth-order median filter is utilized
empirically to remove the transient spikes in the signal caused
by random shocks without distorting the waveform. Training
motion templates are generated by averaging motion samples
collected from rehabilitation experts. Constrained DTW is used
as templates matching method in order to manage the nonstationary and nonlinear variations caused by nonpathological
features in each individual motion sample. The DTW distance
computed is then normalized to produce an index for the proposed mobility evaluation metric system. The process is also
designed to be inexpensive to perform, both financially and
computationally. Therefore, the proposed method only utilizes
20 Hz three-axis accelerometer data collected using single IMU

attached on the patients’ wrist, and the normalization of the evaluation index involves only the lower bound distance calculation,
which is also used for indexing DTW [30] and the upper bound
distance which can be calculated in O(n). In the experiment,
a classification test using KNN classifier has been conducted
to demonstrate the proposed assessment index’s feasibility as a
feature for objective Brunnstrom stage classification. The details
of experiment setup and methods are explained below.
A. Dynamic Time Warping
DTW is a dynamic programming algorithm that is commonly used for temporal sequences similarity measurement in
template-matching application. It is well known for its nonlinear time-normalization effect, which can compensate the timing differences between two temporal sequences by warping
the time-axis before calculating the minimized residue distance
[31]. Comparing to Euclidean distance or cross-correlationbased template matching algorithms, DTW is more flexible and
robust due to its ability to accommodate both phase and speed
variations, and it has been widely implemented in automatic
speech recognition [31] and biomedical signal analysis applications, such as electrocardiography [32], [33] and Photoplethysmograph [34]. To compute the DTW distance for two time series S = {Si |i = 1, 2, . . . , n} and T = {Ti |i = 1, 2, . . . , m}, a
n × m distance matrix D is first constructed, where the (ith, jth)
element of D is the Euclidian distance between the
two matching
points from the original time series: D (i, j) = (Si − Tj )2 .
The warping path w = {wk |k = 1, 2, . . . , K}, which represents
the possible alignments between the two original time series can
then be defined as each element of w is a pair of mapped points
from S and T : wk = (ik , jk ) with following conditions:
1) Monotonic conditions: ik −1 ≤ ik and jk −1 ≤ jk .
2) Continuity conditions: ik − ik −1 ≤ 1 and jk − jk −1
≤ 1.
3) Boundary conditions: i1 = j1 = 1, iK = n, jK = m.
To avoid the warping path with excessive timing difference
and to improve the computation efficiency, an additional locality constraint can be added: |ik − jk | ≤ r, where r is a positive
integer, which can be tuned according to the length of the input
time series [31]. Finally, the DTW distance Ddtw can be calculated by accumulating the distance along the optimal warping
path W which covers the least distance

dissimilarity in motion speed between the candidate motion
sample and the template is compensated by realigning the two
data sequences and resulted in an optimal match. The distance
matrix between the two sequences is visualized in Fig. 2(c). The
darker area along the diagonal indicates warping paths with a
small distance and the red line shows the optimal path which can
lead to shortest DTW distance. The locality constraint can be
seen in Fig. 2(d). When DTW is implemented in our study, 25%
of the data length of the longer candidate sequence are used as
locality constraint. However, in accordance with the boundary
condition of DTW, the length difference between the two data
sequences will be used as constraint if its value is greater than
the calculated constraint, as shown

the mobility index in the proposed system.

high-resolution samples or large sample size, and due to that
the DTW distance does not obey the triangular inequality and
cannot be easily indexed as Euclidean distance [35]. To address
this issue, a number of researchers have proposed techniques
to fast compute an exact lower-bound distance for DTW, which
satisfies the triangular inequality and enables exact indexing to
reduce the computation time without allowing false dismissals
[30], [36], [37]. The lower-bound distance introduced in [30]

The motion sampling experiment was conducted in collaboration with the rehabilitation medical center of the 2nd Hospital
of Jiaxing in China, and was approved by the ethic committees
of RMIT University and the 2nd Hospital of Jiaxing. According to the result of a priori power analysis, a minimum of 20
subjects, with five in each group, are required to achieve a statistical power of 0.95 in the tests of detecting differences in the
limb mobility of patient’s with different degrees of impairment.
Therefore, overall 21 patients (12 males, 9 females, mean age
58.7 ± 19.3, 9 with ischemic stroke and 12 with haemorrhagic
stroke) from different Brunnstrom stages and eight rehabilitation doctors (eight males, mean age 39.1 ± 7.3) as healthy
subjects have been included in this experiment. The patient subject selection is based on the following inclusion criteria: 1) the
participant must have no hemodynamic instability, 2) no severe
cognitive impairments, 3) no dementia, 4) no major poststroke
complication, 5) able and willing to give consent, 6) due to the
reason that the patients at Brunnstrom Stages I and II are unable
to perform unsupported upper extremity voluntary movement
which can be captured using the IMU sensor, only patients at
Stages III and above will be included in the experiment. All patient subjects were examined by an expert panel for Brunnstrom
stages prior to the sampling experiment. The panel members are
selected from rehabilitation doctors who have 1) extensive clinical experience with stroke patients and stroke rehabilitation, and
2) experienced in conducting stroke rehabilitation related
medical research. The healthy participants are grouped as
Brunnstrom Stage VI, as patients at Stage VI are nearly recovered and difficult to find in rehabilitation center, and based
on the definition of Brunnstrom stage of recovery, Stage-VI
patient’s motion can be classified as normal [10], [38].
A shoulder touching exercise was selected as the sample
training motion to examine subject’s upper-limb mobility in
the experiment. The motion starts with raising the impaired arm
forward to a horizontal level. It is then followed by an elbow
adduction motion, while rotating the wrist to touch the opposite shoulder with the hand, before gently lowering the arm to
the starting position. The exercise needs to be completed at a
controlled pace without excessive swing movement. This movement is commonly practiced as a rehabilitation training exercise
and is performed as an active range of motion during the experiment, as all the participants have to complete the exercise
without any assistance to reflect their true body functioning. To
execute the motion, voluntary muscle contraction is required
from multiple muscle groups. The extension and flexion motion
of the elbow joint can demonstrate the level of spasticity and
the presence of synergy patterns. In order to smoothly complete
the motion, muscle strength and joint flexibility will also be
tested. Therefore, the shoulder touching exercise is adopted in
this study as a benchmark to reflect stroke patient’s upper-limb
mobility in general and body function impairment level.
During the sampling experiment, the subjects were first asked
to rest at a general sitting position for 2 min. Before the sampling

body function impairment classification. The benefit of the proposed mobility index will be further demonstrated in Sections
III and IV.
Let S = {Si |i = 1, 2, . . . , n} be the candidate training motion data sequence and T = {Ti |i = 1, 2, . . . , m} is the motion
template sequence. The mobility index is defined as

began, they were invited to perform the exercise several times
with the guidance of a trained physician till the motions were
familiarized. They were then required to complete five valid
repetitions of the exercise independently, which were tracked
using a wireless IMU. A valid repetition must be a coherent
movement without interruption and each repetition was required
to be completed during a 10 s timing window. An instruction
video was looped during the sampling process to help the motion
synchronization.
A single low-cost IMU that is specifically developed for poststroke rehabilitation application has been adopted in this study
to sample motion data from subjects. The wireless sensor node
used in the experiments was based on a InvenSense MPU-6050
unit, which can capture acceleration information up to 30 m/s2 ,
and a low-power Zig-Bee-based communication module powered by a 3.7 V, 1000-mA·h polymer lithium-ion battery. The
sensor samples the motion at 20 Hz to capture the slow varying static acceleration that indicates the tilting angle, and the
low sampling rate can help to reduce the computational cost of
DTW. The placement of the sensor nodes in the experiment is
shown in Fig. 4.
C. Mobility Index
As introduced in the previous section, DTW technique can
effectively reject dissimilarities/influences caused by motion
speed and delay. However, it is very sensitive to amplitude difference, as minimal changes in motion magnitude can greatly
affect the output distance. Despite that the motion magnitude
can be considered as an import aspect of motion quality, it is
only able to partially reflect patient’s upper-limb mobility when
other patient conditions and attributes are comparable. When
assessing patient body function and mobility in stroke rehabilitation application, it is also important to examine patient’s
ability of completing exercise motion with correct trajectory,
which can help to detect muscle flaccidity, spasticity, and synergy patterns. Therefore, in the proposed approach, a mobility
index obtained by normalizing the DTW distance with estimated
upper and lower bound is used to evaluate patient’s upper limb
mobility. The normalization process scales the unbounded output distance down to a defined range in relation to the theoretical
extrema, which makes the results more comparable and reduces
the sensitive to general motion magnitude variation. As a result,
the mobility index is more suitable as an assessment score to facilitate the poststroke rehabilitation training and generate more
accurate result, when adopted as an input feature for automatic

where Qm obility is the proposed mobility index. Ddtw (S, T ) is
the DTW distance between candidate sequence S and Template
T. Dlb (S, T ) is the lower-bound distance for Ddtw (S, T ), as
introduced in [30], which is originally designed for exact indexing DTW. Du b is the estimated upper-bound distance for
Ddtw (S, T ), which is calculated by multiplying the maximum
distance with the length of the diagonal path. It is assumed that
the distance between the two data sequences is largest, when
they are uniformly separated by the maximum possible distance
and no warping action will occur. The dynamic range of Qm otion
is (0, 1]. The maximum achievable score, which is 1 in the proposed single index metric system, can only be obtained when
Ddtw (S, T ) is equal to the lower bound distance Dlb (S, T ),
which indicates that the candidate motion sample matches the
template exactly. As the difference between the two sequences
increases, the mobility index keeps reducing and approaching 0.
During the experiment, when the shoulder touching exercise is
performed by the stroke patients with a Brunnstrom stages from
III to VI voluntarily and recorded using the proposed device and
setting, the mobility index can range from 0.65 to 0.98.
D. Brunnstrom Stages of Recovery
Brunnstrom stages of recovery is a well-known measure for
modeling the recovery process, following stroke-induced hemiplegia [10], [11], and is adopted in this study to prove the validity
of the proposed assessment method. The Brunnstrom approach
is focused on the progressive development of the motion synergic pattern during the rehabilitation process, and divides the
motor recovery process into six stages from the period of complete flaccidity, which begins immediately after stroke onset
to the disappearance of spasticity when the patient is able to
perform near-normal to normal movement. Brunnstrom stages
are very commonly adopted clinically to classify the stroke patient’s rehabilitation progress due to its simplicity and validity
[39]–[41]. The six-stage classification system of the Brunnstrom
approach emphasizes the key factors closely associated with the

rehabilitation progression, including the degree of spasticity and
synergies. The simplicity not only makes the Brunnstrom classification one of the most favorable measures as a repetitive
follow-up test during rehabilitation program, but also helps improves the communication efficiency for patients by allowing
them to easily understand their own recovery progress [41].
III. RESULTS
Fig. 3 shows a comparison between motion samples. The motion template generated by averaging the DTW warped-motion
data sampled from three different rehabilitation doctors is shown
in Fig. 3(a). The motion samples collected from a Brunnstrom
Stage-VI and a Stage-III subject are presented in Fig. 3(b) and
(c), respectively. It is obvious that the Stage-VI subject is able

to follow the predefined motion trajectory more accurately and
consistently with controlled speed, whereas the Stage-III samples tend to be jerky and inconsistent, which are the signs of the
lack of strength, stability, and dexterity. It can be seen that the
Stage-III patient also has difficulty reaching the target position,
as the motions always terminate earlier due to the limitation of
joint flexibility and excessive muscle spasticity. The dissimilarities in the motion trajectory can clearly reflect the limitations
of the subject’s upper-limb mobility.
The mobility evaluation results, including the medians, 25th
and 75th percentiles, and nonoutliner ranges of both the DTW
distance and mobility index calculated for each impairment
groups and individuals are presented in Table I. The 29 subjects are classified into four impairment groups, based on their
Brunnstrom stage evaluated by the expert panel prior to the

experiment. Stage-III subjects suffer from severe motor function impairment, and their limb mobility is considerably limited
due to excessive spastic hypertonia. Both the DTW distance and
mobility index suggest that Stage-III subjects’ motion quality
is relatively poor and inconsistent. Although, some individuals,
such as S8 are capable of achieving single motion mobility index as high as 0.880, large fluctuation in performance can be
observed which indicates impaired limb control and endurance.
Stage-IV and Stage-V subjects are affected by mild to moderate impairment. The declining muscle spasticity and obligatory
synergy motion patterns enable the patients to perform more
isolated voluntary limb motion and complete the exercise motion with higher precision. This improvement is clearly verified
in the mobility evaluation result, as the group DTW distance
median dropped 45% from 58.2 to 32.0, and the mobility index
median increased by 10.7% from 0.782 to 0.866. However, due
to stroke induced pain and impaired muscles control, some subjects such as S21 at this stage also tend to perform with an even
wider range of motion quality due to few underperformed motion samples. Stage-VI subjects in this experiment are healthy
participants, and a significant leap in the motion quality can be
observed in the result compared to stroke-patient subjects. The
subjects in this group are not only able to complete training

motions with remarkably high quality but also retain very high
consistency. The difference between subjects is also relatively
smaller as all health participants do not suffer from any limitation in limb mobility, and are able to adhere precisely to the
predefined motion trajectory. It is worth noting that the proposed
mobility index has exhibited superior ability to suppress the excessive influences of motion magnitude difference and reduce
the variance within each group, compared to the original DTW
distance. For instance, S11 is considered as an extreme case
in Stage-III group due to the large DTW distance. The subject
failed to raise the elbow to required height voluntarily during
the first stage of the motion; therefore, caused a significant dissimilarity in signal magnitude despite the ability to complete the
motion reasonably well on the horizontal axis. However, when
the subject was evaluated using the the proposed mobility index,
the influence of magnitude difference was suppressed and, thus,
the result can correctly reflect the patient’s performance.
The evaluation results are visualized in Fig. 5. Significant
difference can be observed in the mobility index of subjects from
different Brunnstrom stage groups (p < 0.001, 95% CI: 0.09,
0.12, two-tailed Welch’s t-test), and a strong correlation can be
found between the mobility index and the subject’s Brunnstrom
stage (r = 0.862, p < 0.001), which is an improvement from

the correlation estimated using the original DTW distance (r =
−0.795, p < 0.001). Sufficient statistical power has also been
validated in a post-hoc analysis, where a power of 0.99 was
obtained in the test of differentiating the mobility of the healthy
and impaired subjects (α = 0.05, Cohen’s d = 2.5, one-tailed ttest), and 0.94 and 0.75 was obtained, respectively, between the
patient groups (Cohan’s d: 1.95 and 0.85, compromise analysis
with a β/α ratio of 1). By observing the difference between
the distribution of the DTW distance and mobility index in
Fig. 5(c) and (f), it can be seen that the mobility index was able
to better differentiate the different impairment groups, especially
for groups at Stages III and VI, and their medians as indicated
using red markers are more evenly and sparsely separated, which
helps to reduce class overlapping in classification applications.
The computation speed test is performed on a workstation
with Intel Core i5-2467 M 1.6-GHz CPU with 4-GB RAM using
MATLAB in Windows environment. Each operation has been
executed for 360 times to estimate the average performance.
The average time consumed for computing DTW distance is 8
or 3.6 ms with 25% constraint. The average time consumed for
mobility index estimation is 3.8 ms.
In order to prove the applicability of the proposed assessment
system, a series of Brunnstrom stage classification tests have
been conducted with proposed upper-limb mobility index as input features. Table II, III, and IV show the confusion matrix for
the leave-one-out (LOO) classification test. The maximum overall classification accuracy 82.1% is achieved, when using KNN
classifier with k = 3. It can be seen that the obvious difference
in upper-limb mobility evaluation result between healthy and
stroke patients has ensured that Stage-VI group can always be
classified with 92.5% accuracy and sensitivity. Relatively lowclass sensitivity is presented for Stage-IV and Stage-V patients

in all three classification methods. According to the definition
of Brunnstrom stages [10], [11], the major difference between
the two groups is the development of synergy pattern and isolated joint movements, which can be unapparent when measured
using single IMU and require additional features to further distinguish the specific motion patterns in each group.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this study, a novel single-index-based metric system
for upper-limb mobility evaluation in poststroke rehabilitation
has been developed, and its validity has been tested against
Brunnstrom stages of recovery, which is an example of widely
used conventional clinical ordinal scale.
The proposed method utilizes motion data sampled from
stroke patients during rehabilitation training using low-cost
IMU. The relatively low sampling rate and small data size
has ensured the practicality of the proposed algorithm without scarifying its validity and sensitivity, as demonstrated in
the experiment. The experiment result suggests the proposed
method is consistent with the general sequential development
of the motor recovery after the stroke, and the high correlation
with Brunnstrom stages of recovery has revealed its feasibility
as input feature for automatic body function impairment classification.
Template matching-based algorithms have been previously
used successfully for differentiating the training movements in
poststroke rehabilitation training [42], [43]. However, the Euclidean distance and cross-correlation-based methods are not
effective for evaluating patient’s mobility, as they are unable
to adapt to various motion speeds. To overcome this problem,
DTW distance is employed in this study and a novel mobility
index has also been generated to further improve the validity
and efficacy of the objective mobility evaluation without adding
significant computation load. The experiment result has demonstrated that the proposed mobility index performs superiorly on
multiple aspects compared to the original DTW distance.
After the discovery of the high correlation between the proposed mobility index and Brunnstrom stages of recovery, a series
of classification experiments have been conducted to further examine the applicability of the proposed method. Various types
of classifiers have been applied, including the Naive Bayes classifier, quadratic discriminant analysis, and KNN. The mobility
indexes on three motion axes are used as the only input features,
and the performance is evaluated by conducting a LOO-based

ZHANG et al.: OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF UPPER-LIMB MOBILITY FOR POSTSTROKE REHABILITATION

validation test to ensure repeatable result. Highly promising
results have been obtained with maximum 82.1% overall classification accuracy, and 92.7% and 92.5% single-class sensitivity
for Stage-III and Stage-VI groups. Compared to the specifically designed Brunnstrom classification method as in [44], the
assessment method proposed in this paper can achieve similar
result with much less complexity in both hardware and software.
The proposed upper-limb mobility evaluation method is also
versatile when applied in poststroke rehabilitation training. It
generates normalized quantitative result which can be easily
comprehended by stroke patients and recorded by software systems. Therefore, it is also a feasible solution for enhancing supervision in telerehabilitation programs besides providing training
feedback and evidence for unified body function assessment in
general clinical settings.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a novel metric system for upper-limb mobility evaluation for poststroke rehabilitation has been proposed.
The contribution of this study is to provide an objective, efficient, and reliable solution for quantitative upper-limb mobility
assessment. It can serve not only as an intuitive feedback to facilitate the patient’s rehabilitation training in both supervised and
unsupervised environment, but also as a reliable evidence for
improving the individualized rehabilitation training and, therefore, realizing the poststroke body function assessment standardization. The experiment results have demonstrated that the
proposed index is capable to reflect the difference in movement quality for patients from different impairment groups. The
strong correlation with the widely used Brunnstrom scale and
the high accuracy in the classification test are also indications
of its potential as a foundation for realizing a realiable quantified method for limb function impairment level assessment.
The evaluation process of the proposed index is designed to be
practical to perform with low financial and computational cost,
and it can be integrated into rehabilitation training systems as
an intuitive feedback to guide the patients for maintaining highstandard training quality. It can also help the clinician to track
patients’ adherence and recovery progress without the need of
the physical presence at the site and observing the full training
session. In the future, it is expected that the proposed index
will be tested with other common clinical assessment scales to
further prove its validity and intermethod reliability. The metric
system will be further extended to cover lower-limb mobility assessment by including gait kinematics measurements. In order
to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed method
in clinical settings, an upper-limb assessment system which is
capable of automatically identifying predefined motions from
routine rehabilitation trainings and conduct assessment using
the mobility index will also be developed and implemented in a
community-based rehabilitation training program.
