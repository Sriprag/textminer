Based on Planar Coils
Hee-Jin Park, Jae Hun Seol, Jeonghun Ku, and Sohee Kim∗ , Member, IEEE

Abstract—Goal: Micromagnetic stimulation using coils sufficiently small to be implanted has been suggested as a potential
method to overcome the limitations of electrical stimulation. We
investigated the temperature increases in the brain implanted with
planar coils. Methods: We conducted computational simulations on
the thermal effects of implantable magnetic stimulation in a brain
model using finite-element analysis, by varying geometric parameters of planar spiral coils, and repetitive stimulation pulse patterns.
Results: It was revealed that the temperature increase in the brain
can be controlled by a careful design of coils to implant. The coil
diameter greater than 8 mm was required to induce a temperature
rise in the brain of less than 1 °C. If the coil diameter was larger
than 10 mm, the subsequent temperature rises in the brain tissue
was maintained consistently at about 0.24 °C or lower. Conclusion:
Selection of the number of coil turns must rely on tradeoffs between the required current and voltage that the implanted source
can generate, as the required voltage increases while the required
current decreases with increasing number of coil turns. Additionally, the coil insulation with a thickness of a few micrometers was
found to suppress the temperature rise in the brain effectively.
Significance: Although these simulations employed only one
threshold value of 10 V/m, which is rather on the lower end of
stimulation threshold, the simulation results are expected to serve
as guidelines for designing planar coils to be implanted in the brain
for magnetic stimulation.

promising treatment method for residual neurological deficits
after brain injuries. Electrical brain stimulation has been used to
help the recovery of neurological impairments following brain
diseases [1]–[4]. Despite such evidences of electrical stimulation, there are still remaining limitations related to devices for
implantation in the living body. When typical microelectrodes
are implanted chronically in living tissues, the functionality
of the stimulator degrades by the membranous tissue formation
around the microelectrodes as a result of inflammatory response
[5]–[8]. Several studies have reported that the plethora of cellular and biochemical events electrically insulates the electrodes
from nearby neurons within four weeks; thereby, increasing its
impedance and contributing degradation of the electrode performance [8], [9]. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging examination impaired the brain tissues of patients implanted with deep
brain stimulators by excessive inductive heating at the electrode
tip [10]–[12].
Micromagnetic stimulation is a novel method to overcome the
aforementioned limitations of the conventional electrical stimulation methods [13]–[15]. This stimulation method is based on
implantable coils utilizing the principle of electromagnetic induction as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) does, which
is one of the noninvasive magnetic stimulation methods using
induction currents generated by time-varying magnetic fields.
One advantage of implantable magnetic stimulation is that the
stimulation performance of the coil would be sustainable, even
if a fibrotic encapsulation layer is formed around the implanted
coil by foreign body reactions as induced currents are used to
elicit neural activations. Thus, it would be more suitable for
chronic neural stimulation for treatment purposes rather than
acute applications where TMS have played significant roles.
Additionally, compared to conventional TMS, implantable magnetic stimulation can stimulate a smaller area [13], [14], thus
expected to minimize the side effects generated by stimulating
untargeted areas.
To activate neural cells without brain tissue damage, implantable magnetic stimulation must satisfy the following two
conditions: the electric field intensity needs to be higher than
10 V/m in the target neurons to elicit neuronal activations [13],
[16] and the maximum allowable temperature rise needs to be
less than 1 °C [17], [18]. Although there have been reports
on more realistic stimulation models of neurons [19]–[21], we
used the above electric field intensity proven by experiments as
the threshold for neural excitation. Brain temperature is usually
maintained by the homeostasis with a fluctuation of less than
1 °C [22]. However, because a brain is extremely sensitive to

temperature change, a temperature increase of 2 °C in the brain
results in abnormalities associated with disturbances in permeability of the brain-blood barrier, brain edema, and irreversible
damages of neural cells. Even if a brain temperature increase
of 1 °C lasted for a long period of time, vasodilation, nearmaximum oxygen metabolism, and reoxygenation after severe
hypoxia were accompanied by the warming of brain tissues [17],
[18]. Hence, the allowable temperature increase in brain tissues
by implantable magnetic stimulation was limited to 1 °C in this
study.
Although the feasibility of micromagnetic stimulation of neural cells was demonstrated [13], [14], the thermal effects of the
coil implanted in the brain have not been reported to date, which
however is thought to be the primary source of adverse effects of
implantable magnetic stimulation, and thus, deserves investigations [15]. Not only during micromagnetic stimulation but also
during TMS, the temperature in the brain has not been measured
or computationally simulated. It is presumably due to the difficulty in measuring temperature of internal brain without causing measurement artifacts and the complexity in multiphysics
simulations, respectively. In conventional TMS, the studies on
coil designs to improve the focality and depth of the induced
electric field [23]–[25] have been reported. However, conventional parameters used for TMS are unsuitable for implantable
magnetic stimulation as coils used in TMS are too large to be
implanted. For a planar coil located on the cortex to be used for
implantable magnetic stimulation, the geometrical parameters
of the coil needs to be determined taking into account the sufficient stimulation effect and thermal and electromagnetic safety
for long-term use, simultaneously.
As the temperature inside tissues generally cannot be easily
measured, we conducted a computational study on the thermal
effects caused by planar coils used for implantable magnetic
stimulation in a brain. Finite-element analysis (FEA) was used to
simulate the temperature increase caused by the current flowing
through the coil to induce sufficient electric field in the target
tissue, according to varying geometric parameters of the coil
and consecutive pulse patterns used in repetitive TMS (rTMS).
Based on the simulated results, guidelines on the design of
implantable planar coils were suggested.

In bioheat transfer dealing with living tissues, blood perfusion
and metabolic activity need to be considered. Therefore, the heat
transfer including bioheat phenomena is governed by

based on the Pennes bioheat equation [28]. The change rate of
thermal energy stored in the matter, on the left-hand side of (8),
is related to the net conduction heat flux through the matter,

simulation with electromagnetic simulation as
Qcoil = J · E.

The principle of implantable magnetic stimulation is based
on Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. The induced
electric field and current are calculated from the applied timevarying magnetic field using Maxwell’s equation. The electric
field E has a relationship with the magnetic flux density B as

accumulation of −࢟V. As most biological tissues are regarded

interaction between electromagnetic and heat transfer simulations. In the first part of the simulation, electromagnetic simulation, the induced electric field was calculated for various source
currents flowing through the coil. In the second part, heat transfer simulation, Joule’s heating caused by the current flowing
through the coil served as the heat source to increase temperature of the simulated domain. To balance between the accuracy
and computational efficiency, a simplified 2-dimensional (2-D)
axisymmetric model was used to model the various tissues of
human brain as shown in Fig. 1. Here, the complicated curvature
of the brain was not considered as a 3-D FEA model consisting of two structures with extremely different dimensions, a
planar coil with micrometer dimensions (spacing, width, and
thickness) and brain tissues with several millimeters up to centimeters, makes the finite-element simulation extremely difficult
in creating mesh and in solving the matrix equations. The model
included skull, scalp, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray matter, and
white matter as shown in Fig. 1, with thicknesses taken from
the literature [30]. The surface of gray matter was set to be z =
0 mm. The line A-B of the model in Fig. 1(b) represents the axis
of symmetry about which a 2-D geometry can revolve by full
360°. The size of the domain was determined to be sufficiently
large such that the simulated electric field intensities converged
to constant values. At the boundaries except the axis of symmetry (along B-C, C-D-E, and E-A), the Neumann boundary
condition was assumed

where the convective heat transfer coefficient h and the external
temperature Text were assumed to be 5 W·m−2 ·K−1 [31] and
25 ºC, respectively. In the entire domain, the initial temperature
was set to be 36.5 ºC. Planar coils used in simulations were
composed of copper traces and 15-μm-thick polyimide layers
on both top and bottom sides to insulate coil traces. The coil was
located on the surface of the gray matter as shown in Fig. 1. All
material properties used in this simulation are summarized in
Table I. The electrical and thermal properties of the copper coil
were taken from the material libraries provided by COMSOL.
The properties of the polyimide, Dupont Kapton polyimide,
were taken from the material database provided by the manufacturer [32]. The electrical and thermal properties of blood and
brain tissues are the averaged values taken from the literature
[33]–[35]. In the FEA model, triangular elements with a minimum element size of 3 μm were built in complex geometry and
the maximum number of elements was about 110 000. In order
to solve the nonlinear system, COMSOL multiphysics newton
solver was used.
C. Variables Under Investigation
1) Geometrical Parameters of the Coil: To simulate the effect
of the geometrical parameters of the coil, various line widths
and outer diameters of the coil were used. We fixed the line
spacing and thickness of the coil at 30 μm, which is feasible to
be fabricated by microelectromechanical systems technologies.
Moreover, the inner diameter was fixed to be 1 mm in order to
maximize the usable area within a planar coil. The geometrical
parameters of the coil are varied as listed in Table II. The outer
diameter of the coil was increased from 5 to 30 mm with a 5 mm
interval, with the corresponding numbers of turns of 35, 79, 123,
167, 211, and 254. The effect of changing the line width was
also investigated with coils at fixed outer diameters of 5 and
10 mm.
In all the simulations, a damped-cosine waveform that has
been widely used in TMS devices [36], [37] was applied to
the coil, as shown in Fig. 2. A pulse width of 300 μs was
used as it has been typically used in the majority of currently
available TMS devices [37]–[39]. This pulse width resulted in
the required bandwidth for the coil of up to 10 kHz. The selfresonance frequencies of the used coils were tens of megahertz,
significantly higher than the maximum frequency contained in
the used waveform. A rate of voltage change of 60 V/μs was
chosen among the values of voltage gradients ranged from a few
volt per microsecond to several tens of volt per microsecond
used in TMS studies [13], [40], [41]. In each condition, the
minimum required voltage and current were determined when it

induced an electric field in the pyramidal layer with the intensity
of 10 V/m with a margin less than 0.5 V/m.
2) Thickness of the Insulation Layer: To investigate the effect
of the insulation thickness that is important for relieving heat
from the coil to the brain tissues, thicknesses of polyimide insulation of 0 (no insulation), 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 μm were simulated.
A damped cosine waveform with an amplitude of 41 V, a pulse
width of 300 μm, and the rate of voltage change of 60 V/μs
were applied for 300 μm to the coil with the line width, spacing,

and thickness of 30 μm, the outer diameter of 10 mm, and the
number of turns of 75.
3) Duration of Stimulation: As repetitive magnetic stimulation for a long time is essential in clinical treatment, we investigated the temperature rise during the stimulation for a longer
period. Based on the previously used continuous theta burst
stimulation (cTBS) and quadri-pulse stimulation (QPS) waveforms [42], [43], long-term stimulation parameters were chosen
to be interstimulus interval (ISI) of 20 and 5 ms, and intertrain
interval (ITI) of 200 ms and 5 s for cTBS and QPS, respectively,
as shown in Fig. 6(b). In cTBS and QPS conditions, trains of
damped cosine waveforms with an amplitude of 41 V, a pulse
width of 300 μm, and the rate of voltage change of 60 V/μs
were applied to the coil described above, with the insulation
thickness of 15 μm.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Determination of Data Extraction Points
To determine the exact locations where the maximum temperature rises and the maximum intensities of induced electric
fields must to be extracted, preliminary simulations were performed using planar coils with various diameters. As the internal
pyramidal layer (layer V of gray matter) targeted for effective
brain stimulation is located at about 2 mm deep from the gray
matter surface [44], the induced electric field intensities were
extracted at z = −2 mm, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows the
spatial distributions of the electric field intensity induced in the
pyramidal layer and the temperature rise on the gray matter surface. In Fig. 3(a), the electric field intensity was maximized at
about 65%–85% of the radius of the coil, whereas the maximum temperature was relatively even across the coil turns in the
radial direction as shown in Fig. 3(b). Along the vertical direction (z-axis), the electric field intensity was at its maximum at
z = 0.03 mm, which occurred at the center of the coil, as shown
in Fig. 3(c), whereas the temperature was maintained evenly
throughout the insulation layer including the coil as shown in
Fig. 3(d). Based on these preliminary results, in simulations
using varying coil diameters, we first extracted the computed
values of induced electric field intensity and temperature along
z = −2 mm (pyramidal layer) and z = 0 mm (gray matter surface), respectively. Subsequently, we extracted the maximum
values of induced electric field intensity and temperature rise
from the plots similar to Fig. 3(a) and (b). On the other hand, in
simulations when the coil parameters were fixed with the outer

162

radius of 5 mm, the maximum electric field intensities in the
pyramidal layer (z = −2 mm) were extracted at r = 3.523 mm
and the maximum temperature rises on the gray matter surface
(z = 0 mm) were extracted at r = 2.975 mm.
B. Effect of Geometrical Parameters of the Coil
Fig. 4(a) and Table II show the required minimum current
for neural activation in the pyramidal layer and corresponding
temperature rises on the gray matter surface as a function of coil
diameter. Here, the increase in coil diameter was accompanied
by the increase in the number of coil turns. As the coil diameter
increased, both the required current and the temperature rise
in the coil as well as on the gray matter decreased. For 5- and
10-mm coils, currents of 4.005 and 1.595 A were required to
induce an electric field of around 10 V/m in the pyramidal layer,
respectively. As the coil diameter increased from 5 to 10 mm, the
temperature rise in the coil significantly decreased from 10.361
to 1.473 °C, whereas the temperature rise on the gray matter
surface also decreased from 1.499 to 0.236 °C. It may imply
that the heat dissipation through the insulation layer between
the coil and the gray matter surface suppressed the temperature
rise in the tissues surrounding the coil. The insulation layer
reduced the temperature rise on the gray matter surface by a
factor of 6.7 than that in the coil. When the coil diameter was
larger than 20 mm, the difference of temperature rise in the coil
and on the gray matter surface remained constant at 0.650 and
0.096 °C, respectively. For the coils with diameters of larger
than 8 mm, the temperature rises on the gray matter surface was
lower than 1°C. For the 10-mm coil, the maximum temperature
rise in the brain was 0.236 °C, for instance.
In Fig. 4(b), the required minimum current for neural activation in the pyramidal layer and the maximum temperature
rises are presented as a function of line width of the coils with
5 and 10 mm diameters. As the line width increased, the required current increased, whereas the temperature rises generally decreased. The temperature rises in the gray matter were
1.340 ± 0.113 and 0.227 ± 0.007 °C with the 5- and 10-mm
coils, respectively. For the 10-mm coil, the required voltage is
shown along with the required current in Fig. 4(c), as a function
of line width. With increasing line width, more current and less
voltage were required, resulting in a temperature rise of about
0.227 °C consistently, which is within the thermal safety limit.
Thus, tradeoffs between required voltage and current need to be
carefully made.
C. Thickness of the Insulation Layer

layer (at z = −2 mm) and temperature rise on the gray matter surface (at z =
0 mm): (a) Electric field intensity in the pyramidal layer and (b) temperature
rise on the gray matter surface along the radial direction (r-axis) for various coil
diameters, (c) electric field intensity in the pyramidal layer and (d) maximum
temperature rise on the gray matter surface along the vertical direction (z-axis).

In Fig. 5, the spatial distribution of temperature rise around
the coil is presented. The maximum temperature in the coil
was detected at 300 μs, just prior to turning off a dampedcosine pulse. Fig. 5(a) shows the maximum temperature in the
tissue surrounding the coil along the z-direction, for various
thicknesses of insulation layer. In the magnified view, a sharp
transition of temperature occurred in the insulation layer, indicating that the insulation layer acted to effectively block a rapid
temperature rise on the gray matter surface. Thus, the coil temperature became higher as the insulation thickness increased.

(r = 2.975 mm, z = 0 mm) as a function of insulation thickness.

Even in the case that no insulation was used, the temperature
raised abruptly only in the vicinity of the coil (within 15 μm
from the coil) and did not increase much in regions away from
the coil at the time when the maximum temperature rise occurred. The maximum temperature in the coil was lowest with
no insulation layer, indicating that the insulation layer trapped
the heat from the coil inside. CSF layer in direct contact with
the coil helped the heat release from the coil because CSF has a
higher thermal conductivity by more than a factor of three than
that of the insulation layer [34], [45], [46]. While the stimulation source was turned off, the temperature in the coil gradually
decreased due to the heat dissipation through the insulation
whereas the temperature in the surrounding tissues increased
more slowly, which is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 5(b) (also,
see the supplementary video clip). Fig. 5(b) shows the change
in the spatial distribution of temperature in the z-direction for
100 ms after the voltage source was turned off in the case that
the 15-μm-thick insulation was used. In the magnified view, the
temperature decreased in the coil, whereas the temperature in
the surrounding tissues increased slowly and then decreased in
the time course, indicating that the heat generated in the coil was
slowly transferred to the surrounding tissue during the cessation
of the voltage source. The induced electric field intensity in the
pyramidal layer was 10.304 V/m with no insulation layer and
10.185 V/m with 15-μm-thick insulation. The insulation layer
made only 1.16% difference in the intensity of the induced electric field. Both of electric field intensities were expected to be
sufficient to activate cells in the pyramidal layer. Fig. 5(c) shows
the maximum temperature rise in the coil and on the gray matter
surface as a function of insulation thickness. When there was no
insulation layer, the maximum temperature on the gray matter
surface and in the coil was identical as the heat generated in
the coil would transfer immediately to the gray matter that is in
contact with the coil. As the insulation thickness increased, the
maximum temperature in the coil remained relatively unaffected
by the insulation thickness. On the contrary, the maximum temperature on the gray matter surface was effectively decreased as
the insulation thickness increased. Depending on the thickness
of insulation, the temperature rise was suppressed by 40% to
70% in the brain tissue compared to the case when no insulation
was used.
If the insulation thickness was greater than 1 μm, the temperature rise on the gray matter surface was lower than 1°C from
the normal temperature. Thus, increasing the thickness of the
insulation layer decreased the temperature rise on the gray matter surface effectively as the thermal energy was considerably
dissipated when passing through the insulation layer. Another
aspect to determine the insulation thickness of the coil is the
electrical stability of the insulation layer. The breakdown voltage of polyimide is known to be 303 kV/mm at film thickness
of 25 μm [47]. The required voltage to induce sufficient electric
field in the brain via magnetic stimulation using the implanted
planar coil was 41 V, which corresponds to 41 kV/mm for the
coil with an insulation thickness of 1 μm, which is the minimum thickness required to suppress temperature rise below
1°C. Thus, it is below the breakdown voltage of polyimide, but
a thicker insulation may be desirable for higher electrical safety.

Fig. 6. Temperature rise (a) in the coil and (b) on the gray matter surface
according to different repetitive stimulation patterns of QPS and cTBS, and (c)
predicted temperature rise for a longer time by extrapolating the simulated data
using exponential fitting. The thermal steady state is reached at about 8 s, at
which time the temperature rise is approximately 1.5 ºC.

D. Duration of Stimulation
In Fig. 6(a) and (b), QPS wave with a relatively shorter ISI
showed maximum temperature rises of 2.586 and 0.785 °C in the
coil and on the gray matter, respectively. When cTBS wave with
ten stimulus trains was applied for 2 s, the consequent maximum
temperature rise was 2.605 and 1.155 °C in the coil and on the
gray matter, respectively. The maximum temperature rises on
the gray matter were lower than 1 °C for QPS but not for cTBS.
In case of QPS wave, the temperature rise on the gray matter
decreased to about 0.1 °C after 0.5 s, from which it is expected
that the increased temperature return to its baseline during the
pause of stimulation before the subsequent QPS train is applied.
With cTBS wave, however, the temperature on the gray matter
exceeded 1 ºC after 1.4 s and was increasing continuously as
time proceeded. As the simulated data in Fig. 6(a) and (b) do
not show the thermal steady state, we extrapolated the simulated
data using exponential fitting as shown in Fig. 6(c). It showed
that the temperature on the gray matter was predicted to reach
the steady state at about 8 s, at which state the temperature would

be 1.5 ºC. Thus, this cTBS pattern may not be recommended as
the stimulation scheme for safe implanted magnetic stimulation
for a longer time. For thermally safe magnetic stimulation, cTBS
with longer ITI is needed to allow for sufficient cooling of the
gray matter as well as the coil. However, this prediction of
steady-state temperature using extrapolation of the simulated
data has limitation that the data on which the fitting is based
were obtained in a region relatively far from the equilibrium,
implicating uncertainties in the predicted temperature value.
E. Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) by Implantable
Magnetic Stimulation
In addition to the temperature increase, the SAR in the brain
under electromagnetic exposure needs to be addressed. SAR is
calculated as
SAR =

σ(r) |E(r)|2
.
2ρ(r)

(13)

The calculated maximum local SAR in the FEA model used
in the present study was 0.59 W/kg in CSF just above the coil.
Considering the international standard that the allowable SAR
in localized head is 2 to 4 W/kg [48]–[50], the calculated SAR
was under the safety limit.
F. Limitations of Implantable Magnetic Stimulation
Throughout the simulations, we used 10 V/m as the threshold
value since it was proven by in vitro experiments of micromagnetic stimulation [13]. Although a few previous studies reported
the threshold electric field of as small as 10 V/m [16], [51], on
which this study is based, the majority of TMS studies reported
the threshold electric field of around 30 up to 100 V/m depending on subject [52], pulse waveform and hemisphere [53], or
stimulator type [54], [55]. Thus, our simulation results on temperature rises in the brain must be understood as the lower limit.
If the threshold is higher than the used value of 10 V/m, as
reported in many TMS studies, higher current and voltage will
be required, resulting in larger temperature rises in the brain.
In addition, the threshold voltage to maintain the temperature
rise in the brain below the allowable level, according to various
source parameters, was not dealt with in this study, although the
threshold to activate neural cells has been known to be dependent
on the stimulation pulse parameters [56]–[60], the type of the
neural cells [61], and brain areas [62]. As the threshold and
pulse width are critical variables to be controlled in implantable

magnetic stimulation, they need to be investigated in vitro or in
vivo experiments in future.
Despite the advantages of implantable magnetic stimulation
preferable for chronic applications, the limitations and disadvantages need to be addressed. First, the required current to
obtain stimulation effects is much higher than that used in conventional electrical stimulation. Subsequently, the implantable
pulse generator needs to be able to provide higher levels of current and energy, which would become a practical challenge to
implement implantable magnetic stimulation in vivo. To provide
such high currents, high voltages as listed in Table II are also
necessary, which, however, would raise another safety concern.
Thus, both the current and voltage must be carefully considered
because the voltage increases as the current decreases. From our
simulations, if the coil diameter is larger than about 10 mm, the
temperature rise in the brain tissue would be maintained consistently at about 0.2 °C. Thus, selecting the number of coil turns
depends on the level of current and voltage that the source can
accommodate. In addition, packaging of the coil is critical for
electrical safety in addition to thermal safety. If the coil insulation is defected, the brain tissue could be directly exposed to
high currents that might lead to serious damages to the brain.
Thus, to prevent current leakage or shortage, a robust insulation
of the coil is essential.

IV. CONCLUSION
We investigated the temperature increase in the brain where
a planar coil is implanted for magnetic stimulation, for the first
time. The temperature rise was computationally investigated using FEA according to various design parameters of the coil and
consecutive pulse patterns of rTMS. Table III summarizes the
relations between the control parameters of the coil and resultant electric and thermal effects. First of all, it was revealed
that the temperature increase in the brain can be controlled by
a careful design of coils. The most critical parameter in designing planar coils is the outer diameter. Considering the dimensions of line width and spacing that can be realized by standard
photolithography for micropatterning, the outer diameter of a
microfabricated planar coil needs to be at least 8 mm in order
to suppress the temperature rise to less than 1°C, while generating a strong enough electric field. If the coil diameter is larger
than 10 mm, the subsequent temperature rises in the brain tissue would be maintained consistently well below the thermal
safety limit. It leaves the selection of the number of coil turns
to depend on tradeoffs between the required current and voltage

166

that the implanted source can generate, as the required voltage
increases while the required current decreases. Additionally, to
further reduce the temperature rise in tissues, it is suggested to
use sufficiently thick coil insulation, taking both thermal and
electrical safety into account. Although these simulations employed only one threshold value of 10 V/m, which is rather on
the lower end of stimulation threshold, the results are expected
to serve as a guideline for designing planar coils to be implanted
in the brain. The simulated results need to be validated by measurements using in vitro brain slices or in vivo brain, which is
currently underway by the authors.
