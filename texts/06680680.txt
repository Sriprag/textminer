Analytic Comparison Between X-Ray
Fluorescence CT and K-Edge CT
Peng Feng, Wenxiang Cong, Biao Wei, and Ge Wang∗ , Fellow, IEEE

Abstract—X-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XFCT)
and K-edge computed tomography (CT) are two important modalities to quantify a distribution of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in a
small animal for preclinical studies. It is valuable to determine
which modality is more efficient for a given application. In this
paper, we report a theoretical analysis in terms of signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) for the two modalities, showing that there is a threshold of GNPs concentration such that XFCT has a better SNR than
K-edge CT when GNPs concentration is less than this threshold,
vice versa. Numerical tests are performed for XFCT and K-edge
CT on two kinds of phantoms with multiple concentration levels
and structural features. Experimental results illustrate that XFCT
is superior to K-edge CT when contrast concentration is lower than
0.4% which coincides with the theoretical analysis.
Index Terms—Gold nanoparticles (GNPs), image noise, image
resolution, K-edge computed tomography (CT), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), X-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XFCT).

I. INTRODUCTION
-RAY computed tomography (CT), including K-edge
computed tomography (CT), has an important role in
diagnosis, staging, treatment planning, and often as a unique
imaging examination method in hospitals and clinics [1]–[3].
Over the past decade, X-ray micro-CT has also seen a great
development for small animal imaging, which is a key part in
research of phenotyping, drug, and disease mechanisms. While
X-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XFCT) with synchrotron radiation used to be irrelevant to biomedical applications, it has recently attracted a major attention for preclinical

research [4], [5]. XFCT can be seen as a stimulated emission
tomography, in which a sample is irradiated with X-rays more
energetic than the K-shell energy of the target elements of interest. This will produce fluorescence X-rays isotropically emitted
from the sample, and the characteristic X-ray can be externally
detected for image reconstruction [6].
Traditionally, XFCT requires monochromatic synchrotron
X-rays to determine a spatial distribution of various elements
[7]–[9], such as Gold (Au), Iodine (I), and Gadolinium (Gd).
However, the synchrotron-based XFCT technique is unsuitable
for in vivo studies in a typical laboratory setting. In 2010,
Cheong et al. reported XFCT experiments with a small animalsized object containing gold nanoparticles (GNPs) using a polychromatic X-ray source at 110 kVp [10], [24]. Meanwhile, the
photon-counting spectral detector which can separately record
photons at different energies has been used in K-edge CT. With
state-of-the-art Medipix-3 spectral detectors, the sensitivity and
image quality of K-edge imaging can be improved with the specification of energy threshold setting [11]. Zhang et al. presented
a preliminary experimental comparison between K-edge imaging and XFCT with Iodine in an animal system. It was shown
that XFCT is promising on objects with dilute contrast materials but without any theoretical analysis [12]. Recently, Bazalova
et al. reported a Monte Carlo XFCT study based on energy resolving detector and compared XFCT with K-edge CT, showing
that XFCT outperforms to K-edge CT in terms of contrast-tonoise ratio (CNR) if the concentration of the contrast agent is
below 0.4%. In their study, the constraint of a zero attenuation
background was assumed for incident and emitted fluorescence
X-rays for use of the filtered backprojection (FBP) method to
produce XFCT image [13].
In this paper, we combine analytic and numerical studies
to compare XFCT and K-edge CT in terms of image resolution, noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and CNR. Two kinds
of phantoms used in our study represent multiple concentration levels and structural features. Also, a first-order model
of Compton scattering was introduced in an earlier simulation
study [4]. XFCT and K-edge CT reconstructions are iteratively
performed after attenuation correction. Data are synthesized assuming GNPs as the contrast agent at different concentrations.
In comparison, K-edge CT [14]–[16] is also simulated in the
identical experimental setting.
The outline of this paper is as follows: In Section II, we
review the principle of XFCT, introduce K-edge CT, and derive
the SNR. In Section III, we compare XFCT and K-edge CT in
terms of SNR. In Section IV, we describe numerical tests with
phantoms containing multiple contrast concentration levels and
structural features. In Section V, we present simulation results

II. PHYSICAL MODELING
A. X-Ray Fluorescence Computed Tomography
The physics and imaging model of XFCT are well known [8],
[9]. The geometry of XFCT is presented in Fig. 1. While the
xy-coordinate system is attached to an object, the st-coordinate
system is spun with the data acquisition system, and can be at
any instant obtained by rotating the xy-coordinate system by an
angle θ counterclockwise. That is, the relationship between the
two coordinate systems can be expressed as follows:
s = xcosθ + y sin θ , t = −xsinθ + ycosθ.

Note that θ and t are variables denoting the angle and the offset of an incident X-ray, respectively. For given θ and t values,
f (θ,s,t) reflects the attenuation process of the incident X-ray
from position B to position A, and g(θ,s,t) is for the fluorescence emission from position A to the detector. With (4), the
measurement I f (θ, t) is directly linked to the GNPs concentration distribution ρ(s, t), assuming that μF (s, t) and μI (s, t) are
both known. Hence, we can reconstruct ρ(s, t) from I f (θ, t).
It is well known that the number of photons emitted from an
X-ray source is a random variable Iinc which obeys a Poisson
distribution [1]:
¯

In the st-coordinate system, let us consider the fluorescence
contribution from a contrast agent at a position A on the primary
beam line. This process can be divided into three steps: (1) the
incident X-ray beam from position B arrives at position A; (2)
the fluorescence X-rays are emitted isotropically from position
A when incident X-ray beam interacts with contrast agent; and
(3) a detector records X-ray fluorescence signals coming from
position A.
Some fluorescence photons emitted from position A will
travel through the phantom, and some photons will be absorbed.
The intensity of the fluorescence X-rays measured by the detector can be formulated as follows:

where I0 is the initial intensity of the incident X-ray beam or the
mean number of incident X-ray photons (photons/cm2 ), μI and
μF are the linear attenuation coefficients for the incident and
fluorescence X-rays, respectively (cm−1 ), ρ(s, t) is the concentration of GNPs represented as a weight percent (i.e., w.t. %),
μph is the photoelectric mass absorption coefficient of GNPs
(cm2 /g), ω is the yield of fluorescence X-rays, β is the solid
angle (rad), and [βm in , βm ax ] is the solid angle range covered by
the detector. The total intensity of the fluorescence X-ray signal
reaching the detector for an incident X-ray beam is obtained by

where I¯A is the mean value of IA . When X-ray photons interact
with contrast agent at position A, the emitted X-ray fluorescence
photons travel through the object. The number of survival fluorescence photons obeys the binomial distribution B(k; m, p),
here, p is the survival probability for photons traveling along that
ray. Hence, the probability distribution of X-ray fluorescence
photons IAf recorded by detector can be written as follows:

Equation (10) indicates that the probability distribution of

B. K-Edge CT
K-edge CT depends on the two energy bins on both sides
of a K-edge of a relatively high atomic number material.
Let μA u (s, t, E) be the linear attenuation coefficient function of a GNPs solution at a position (s, t) and energy E,
and μ̄R
A u (s, t, W ) be the average linear attenuation coefficient
within an energy bin after the K-edge energy, and μ̄LA u (s, t, W )
the counterpart within another energy bin before the K-edge.

where K is the K-edge energy of gold, and K − and K + are
the left and right limits of the K-edge, respectively. To perform
K-edge imaging, we need to select two energy intervals with a
finite width W , one is the left interval up to K − and the other
is the right interval down to K + . W can be set to a width of
the energy bin to achieve an optimal SNR of measurement data
according to [14]. Thus, we can get the highest signal difference
noise ratio for K-edge CT imaging.

Radon transform of a GNPs concentration ρ(s, t) and the logarithm of the ratio between measured photon intensities on both
sides of the K-edge. Equation (23) can be used to reconstruct a
GNPs distribution from measured K-edge imaging data.
III. SNR ANALYSIS OF K-EDGE CT AND XFCT
From Section II, we obtain that the number of X-ray fluorescence photons hitting a detector obeys Poisson
√ distribution, and
the SNR of X-ray fluorescence imaging is λF , where λF is
the average number of detected X-ray fluorescence photons. On
the other hand, for X-ray K-edge imaging, when incident X-ray
beams pass through the object, the number of detected photons
relies on the GNPs concentration ρ and its K-edge energy. The
number of detected photons ξ with an energy bin before the
K-edge can be described by a Poisson distribution with mean
value λ:
λn
(24)
P {ξ = n} = e−λ .
n!
Similarly, the number of detected photons η after the K-edge
also obeys a Poisson distribution with mean value λR :
P {η = n} = e−λR

(λR )n
.
n!

(25)

Let us definex = λR /λ, clearly, 0 < x < 1. Based on (23),
we can define the SNR of X-ray K-edge CT(SNRK ):
E [ln(ξ), λ] − E [ln(η), xλ]
SNRK (x) = 	
D [ln(ξ), λ] + D [ln(η), xλ]

(26)

where ln(ξ) obeys logarithm-Poisson distribution which is defined as follows:
⎧
λ
⎨ P {ln(ξ) = ln(1)} = e−λ ,
1! n
⎩ P {ln(ξ) = ln(n)} = e−λR λR , n = 2, 3, . . . , n ∈ Z+
n!
(27)
where E [ln(ξ),λ] and D [ln(ξ),λ]are its expectation and
variance, respectively. Accordingly, ln(η) is a random variable
and its distribution is similar to ln(ξ); E [ln(η), xλ] and
D [ln(η), xλ] are the expectation and variance of ln(η),
respectively.
Obviously, the definition of SNRK (x) relies on the concentration of contrast agent. When x approaches 1, GNPs become
rather sparse in the object, and SNRK (x)approaches 0. This is
consistent to intuition—no GNP no SNR. When x approaches
0, GNPs with high concentration absorb most of transmitted
and fluorescence X-ray photons in the phantom. In this case, the
detected transmitted X-ray photons before the K-edge of GNPs
represent the measured signal, although few photons can be detected after the K-edge of GNPs. In other words, the fact that no
photon is seen after the K-edge helps confirm the information
contained in the measurement made before the K-edge. Furthermore, the function SNRK (x) has following two properties:
Lemma 1: SNRK (x) is a√monotonically decreasing function.
Lemma 2: SNRK (0) > λ.
Proofs of Lemmas 1 and 2 can be found in Appendices A and
B, respectively.

Fig. 2. Simulation setup of X-ray fluorescence tomography imaging. (a) Phantoms 1–3: multiconcentration settings, and (b) Phantom 4: a multidisk arrangement. Table I lists all the concentrations of the corresponding disks in Phantoms
1–3, respectively.

Combining Lemmas 1 and 2, we conclude that there is a
threshold for the GNPs concentration in the context of XFCT
and K-edge CT. When the GNPs concentration is less than the
threshold, XFCT has a better SNR than K-edge CT, vice versa.
As a matter of fact, by Lemmas √
1 and 2, SNRK (x) is monotonically decreasing, SNRK (0) > λ and SNRK (1) = 0. In this
case, we assume that incident X-ray photons are same for both
imaging modalities at each projection view. Fluorescence yield
(ω) represents the ratio of the number of emitted photons to
the number of absorbed photons; for example, X-ray K-shell
fluorescence yield of gold is 0.964. The number of X-ray fluorescence photons should be less than the number of absorbed
X-ray photons. For in vivo study, the concentration of GNPs
is always below 1.5% (w.t.%) [10], [13], the absorbed incident
X-ray photons must be much less than survived or detected.
So, the average of detected X-ray fluorescence photons should
be smaller than the average of transmitted X-ray photons, i.e.,
one point xT h in
λF < λ. Hence, there must be one and only √
the interval (0, 1) such that SNRK (xT h ) = λF by the intermediate value theorem of continuous functions. At and only
at this threshold value xT h , SNRK is the same as SNRF . For
0 < x < xT h , SNRK > SNRF and K-edge CT is superior to
XFCT. For xT h < x < 1, SNRK < SNRF , and XFCT outperforms K-edge CT in terms of SNR.
IV. NUMERICAL SIMULATION
A. Phantoms
The numerical simulation geometry of XFCT is shown in
Fig. 2. In the simulation with XFCT and K-edge CT, the incident X-ray flux was set to 108 photons/cm2 /s with a pencil
beam cross section 0.25 mm2 . The phantoms were scanned in
the first generation CT scanning mode with a translational step
0.5 mm and a rotational step 3.6◦ . Meanwhile, the detector for
XFCT with the length equal to the diameter of the phantom
was made parallel to the incident X-ray beam, and the distance
between the detector and the border of the phantom was 10 mm.
Each detector element collected the fluorescence photons emitted from contrast agent. Compared with a collimated spectral
detector [3], although Compton scattering was increased, more

fluorescence X-ray photons were acquired to improve the SNR
significantly.
In order to systematically evaluate X-ray fluorescence imaging and K-edge imaging modes, we designed two kinds of phantoms: the multiconcentration phantoms [see Fig. 2(a)] for contrast resolution and the multidisk phantom [see Fig. 2(b)] for
structural features. First, as shown in Fig. 2(a), each of the multiconcentration phantoms (Phantoms 1, 2, and 3) is a circular
object of 64-mm diameter which is discretized into a 128 ×
128 matrix, i.e., the pixel size is 0.25 mm2 . It contains seven
disks (A–G) of 10-mm diameter. The former six disks (A–F)
are placed uniformly along a circle whose diameter is 45 mm.
The seventh disk (G) was placed at the center of the phantom.
As to the multiconcentration phantoms, the seven disks were
filled with the GNPs solution in seven different concentrations
as testing ROIs, with a background full of water. The densities
of GNPs and water are 19.34 and 1 g/cm3 , respectively. Table I
lists all the concentrations of GNPs from 0.1% to 2.1%. For the
definition of concentration, both molar concentration (moles/L)
and mass fraction (kg/kg or w.t.%) are acceptable [25]. As a
follow-up study of [13], we prefer using w.t.% as the unit of
concentration for comparison purpose, which was used in [13].
The concentration of GNPs used in this paper is practically
achievable for in vivo studies.
Second, as shown in Fig. 2(b), the multidisk phantom was
designed to evaluate structural features or spatial-resolving performance of XFCT. It is also a circular object of a 64-mm
diameter and contains 12 small disks (from 1 to 9 mm in diameters). We used GNPs solution as the contrast agent too, and all
the small disks were filled with the contrast agent of the same
concentration 0.6%.
According to the X-ray attenuation databases reported by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology [18], we obtained all the linear attenuation coefficients curves μ(E) with
different concentrations of GNPs. Several examples are plotted
in Fig. 3. Also, two simplified attenuation maps for XFCT imaging, i.e., μI and μF were calculated. For the K-edge tomographic
imaging, the GNP distribution in the object was reconstructed
based on (23). According to [14] and (14)–(17), we set the energy bin W equal to 3 keV for all concentrations. Hence, the
integration window is from 80.7 keV (K-edge energy of gold)
to 83.7 keV for the right side and 77.7–80.7 keV for the left
side. All the linear attenuation coefficients for different concen-

B. Reconstruction Method
Both the analytical reconstruction approach such as the FBP,
and the iterative reconstruction approach such as the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) and simultaneous ART
[1], [17], [19], [20] can be used for XFCT and K-edge CT
reconstruction. In this paper, the maximum likelihood method
with expectation maximization is applied for reconstruction; the
known formula in [21] can be written as follows:

H = H(θ, s, t) = f (θ, s, t)g(θ, s, t).

iteration number was set to 200 according to the error decreasing

First of all, for multiconcentration phantom, we performed ten
groups of simulation for XFCT and K-edge CT, each group has
three phantoms. In order to evaluate the reconstruction quality
due to the influence of different imaging X-ray dose, we added
three kinds of Poisson noise to the detected fluorescence X-ray
signals. The expected value λP of data noise is λP = 1 × 105
(Noise I), λP = 2 × 105 (Noise II), and λP = 3 × 105 (Noise III),
respectively. One example of all reconstructed XFCT and Kedge CT images for three kinds of noise are shown in Fig. 4. It

(l), the disk with the lowest concentration contrast agent (disk
A) in each phantom are hardly visible. It means if the X-ray
imaging dose is too low, the contrast agent with concentration
from 0.1% to 0.3% is undetectable.
It is apparent that the quality of reconstructed images would
be improved with the decrease of λP . However, for Noise I, disk
with 0.1% concentration contrast agent is also undetectable in
XFCT and K-edge CT. For Noise II, for XFCT and K-edge CT,
the lowest concentration of GNPs could be detected is 0.3%
[see Fig. 4(f)] and 0.4% [see Fig. 4(m)], respectively. It illustrates that XFCT is more sensitive to the low concentration than
K-edge CT partially for two reasons: background interfere of
CT imaging and the subtraction operation of K-edge imaging.
Fig. 5 illustrates that for XFCT imaging the average reconstructed concentration value is a function of the concentration
of the contrast agent. It verifies that the variance of reconstructed value would get smaller with λP decreasing. However,
we should pay attention that no matter what is the λP , the variance of reconstructed concentration value would increase with
concentration. It also indicates that the reconstructed value for
larger contrast concentration has bigger fluctuation compared
with smaller concentration.
The reconstructed XFCT images are also evaluated as CNR
by calculating the ratio of the difference between the mean value
of each ROI and background (Water) and square root of sum of
variance of ROI and background. CNR is defined as follows:
Ψ̄ROI − Ψ̄B K
CNR = 	 2
ΦROI + Φ2B K

is evident that the quality of reconstructed images is becoming
worse with the increase of λP for both modalities. Especially
for Noise III, the reconstructed images are interfered by the
noise severely: nonuniform ROI and background, blurred edge
of each disk, partially absence of phantom and some artifacts in
the area of air. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4(a)–(c) and (j)–

(30)

where Ψ̄ROI and Ψ̄B K are mean reconstructed values of ROI
and background, Φ2ROI and Φ2B K are corresponding variances of
ROI and background. The CNR of XFCT images as a function of
the contrast agent concentration and noise variance is plotted in
Fig. 6. Although there are some fluctuations, the trend is clear
that CNR is generally an increasing function of the contrast
agent concentration with respect to noise, and CNR increases
much faster when concentration is smaller than 0.4% than it
does when concentration is bigger than 0.4%. It coincides with
what we mentioned earlier that XFCT is very sensitive to the
change of low concentration. For Noises I, II, and III, all CNRs

are lower than 10 for concentration from 0.1% to 0.3%. We
suggest that 10 is the threshold value of CNR that determine
whether this concentration is detectable.
For comparison, K-edge CT imaging was performed. The
average CNR difference between XFCT and K-edge CT (XFCT
minus K-edge CT) is shown in Fig. 7 as a function of the λP
and the contrast agent concentration. Just like results reported
in [13], for most of concentration values from 0.8% to 1.8%,
the trend is clear that the CNR of a reconstructed XFCT image
is lower than that of the corresponding K-edge CT image. The
difference becomes larger with the concentration increment.
A jump occurs when the concentration goes over 1.8%, we
infer that for disks at the center of the phantom (concentration
from 1.9% to 2.1%), its position has an effect on the XFCT
reconstruction.
For the multidisk phantom, the GNPs solution of 0.6% concentration is in 12 small disks. The diameters of these disks are
from 1 to 9 mm with a water background. XFCT and K-edge
CT images were reconstructed with Noise II, as shown in Fig. 8.
The average difference in CNR between XFCT and K-edge CT
images (XFCT minus K-edge CT) is shown in Fig. 9. It can be
observed that XFCT produced better images for smaller disks

(from 1 to 3 mm in diameter), as compared to K-edge CT in
terms of uniformity, edge, and contrast.
It is clear that both imaging modalities are influenced by the
ROI size as well as by the contrast agent concentration. Due
to the influence of noise, the difference of CNR has some fluctuation. But the fitted curve shows a trend that the difference
between XFCT and K-edge CT becomes smaller with the increase of disk size. In other words, K-edge CT could give better
results over a larger ROI.
VI. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION
This is a theoretical analysis and preliminary simulation for
XFCT. There are many factors, such as the energy spectrum
distribution of X-ray source, attenuation correction of phantom,
other physical reaction including absorption and emission and
detector efficiency, can affect the final results. Nevertheless, our
derivation and simulation is rigorous and can be applied to a
class of phantoms.
Theoretically, we analyze the performance of XFCT and
K-edge CT in terms of SNR. It is well known that the fluctuation in the number of incident X-ray photons is the main
source of noise that compromises the performance of an X-ray
imaging system. This kind of noise obeys a Poisson distribution,
which is why we have taken the Poisson noise into consideration
in this paper. In a follow-up study, a more realistic Monte Carlo

982

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 3, MARCH 2014

simulation will be performed to include X-ray dose, Compton
scattering, energy resolution, filter effect, etc.
The relationship between SNR and concentration of the contrast agent shows that XFCT outperforms K-edge CT when the
concentration is lower than a threshold value, and on the other
hand K-edge CT is superior to XFCT when the concentration is
higher than this threshold. The numerical results are in support
of this relationship. For contrast agent concentrations of GNPs
from 0.8% to 2.1%, there is a consistent trend that K-edge CT
outperforms XFCT in terms of CNR, and the difference in CNR
increases as the contrast agent concentration grows. For concentrations from 0.4% to 0.7%, CNR values of both imaging
modalities give small readings. For concentrations from 0.1%
to 0.3%, CNR with XFCT is higher than that with K-edge CT.
This is attributed to a combination of higher noise in K-edge
CT compared to XFCT and the imperfect subtraction of the
background material. Also, a fixed energy bin width for K-edge
CT might not yield a best image quality. Unlike conventional
transmission CT imaging, XFCT and K-edge CT imaging emphasizes the distribution of the contrast agent. CNR of XFCT
does not directly depend on the background tissue. On the other
hand, the background subtraction plays an important role for
K-edge CT, which may cause a decrement in CNR in the case
of low concentrations.
Due to the noncollimated detector setup, which will result
in more Compton scatter contamination, a scattering compensation algorithm is introduced into our simulation. Based on
our previous work with a first-order model [4], it is shown that
scatter does not change reconstructed image quality much. We
also note that CNR increases slowly between 1.5% and 1.7%
which is shown in Fig. 6, so more complicated phantoms and
simulations should be investigated in the follow up study.
In [26], a survey on the public attitude to the risk of nanotechnologies reported that people focused on benefits rather
than risks and had a high regard for science and technology, but
toxicology of GNPs for in vivo research is still un-negligible.
Generally, the lower concentration of GNPs, the lower toxicity.
The theoretical analysis in this paper proves that XFCT is superior to K-edge CT for a sufficiently low concentration of the
contrast agent, which favors XFCT in such experiments.
As shown in our multidisk phantom-based comparison, there
are many factors, such as the energy spectrum distribution of the
X-ray source, can affect the final results. Our preliminary simulation results demonstrate that ΔCNR becomes smaller with
the increase of the target disk size, although it seems not dramatic. [13] also reported similar conclusions. Theoretical analysis of the effects of ROI size and contrast agent concentration
will be our next step to investigate.
In conclusion, we have performed analytic and numerical
comparisons between XFCT and K-edge CT modes in terms
of image resolution, noise, SNR, and CNR. In the theoretical
study, we have demonstrated that there is a threshold value
in GNPs concentration, and XFCT has a better SNR than Kedge CT if the contrast concentration is less than this value.
Numerical tests with various concentration levels and structural
features have shown that XFCT is superior to K-edge CT when
GNPs concentration is lower than 0.4%. Further research will be

focused on taking more imaging parameters into consideration
to guide biomedical imaging applications.

Proof: Let Θ(x) = SNRK (x). According to (A.1), when x
approaches 0 which means no photons can emitted from the
phantom, i.e., the probability of 0 X-ray photon is 1. It is easy
to derive E[ln(η), xλ] = 0 and D[ln(η), xλ] = 0, the Θ(x) is

In the following, let us numerically verify Lemma 1. First,
the parameters were set up in consistence to real experiments.
Table A.I shows the results of Θ (x) for different x and λ. For
common microfocus polychromatic X-ray sources, the average
X-ray photon count rate (λ) is approximate 106 counts/mm2 /s
and often decreased by 10–100 times if a filter is applied to
the incident beam [11], [12]. Hence, four different λ values
were tested, including 1 × 103 , 1 × 104 , 1 × 105 , and 1 ×
106 counts/mm2 /s. It can be seen in Table A.I that Θ (x) < 0
when 0 < x ≤ 1. In other words, Θ(x) is monotonically decreasing over the interval [0, 1], and Θ(x)|x∈[0,1],x= 0 should be
smaller than Θ(0).

Then, we can verify that only when λ ≤ 6, γ1 < 0. Since in
experimental setups, λ is always much larger than 6, we must
have γ1 > 0. For γ2 , according to (B.3), we have γ2 > 0. For
γ3 , the first derivative of γ3 is larger than 0, and γ3 |n =1 = 0
which means γ3 > 0.
From (B.6), we have dQ/dλ ≥ γ1 + γ2 + γ3 ≥ 0 which
shows that Q(λ) is monotonically increasing. In reality, the
mean of collected X-ray photons, i.e., λ, is much larger than
