Abstract—A new glucose–insulin model is introduced which fits
with the clinical data from in- and outpatients for two days. Its
stability property is consistent with the glycemia behavior for type
1 diabetes. This is in contrast to traditional glucose–insulin models.
Prior models fit with clinical data for a few hours only or display
some nonnatural equilibria. The parameters of this new model are
identifiable from standard clinical data as continuous glucose monitoring, insulin injection, and carbohydrate estimate. Moreover, it
is shown that the parameters from the model allow the computation of the standard tools used in functional insulin therapy as
the basal rate of insulin and the insulin sensitivity factor. This is
a major outcome as they are required in therapeutic education of
type 1 diabetic patients.
Index Terms—Clinical data, functional insulin therapy (FIT),
glycemia, modeling, type 1 diabetes.

I. INTRODUCTION
YPE 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease leading to the destruction of the pancreatic β-cells.
Thus, the endogenous insulin secretion disappears and the natural mechanisms of glycemic regulation is dysfunctional. Type 1
diabetes was a rapidly fatal disease until the discovery of insulin
in 1921 by Banting et al. [1]. Besides, uncontrolled blood glucose (BG) leads to severe burden as blindness or kidney failure.
One of the best current treatment is functional insulin therapy
(FIT). FIT consists of a number of daily insulin injections depending on measurements of glycemia and carbohydrate food
intake (CHO), with the purpose of maintaining normoglycemia
(range: 70–120 mg/dl). FIT provides four tools, e.g., basal rate,
insulin sensitivity factor (ISF), to help patients compute insulin
doses [2], [3].
Despite these tools, most of the patients have difficulties in
computing the correct amount of insulin to be injected due to
incorrect estimates of carbohydrate food intake. The incidence
of physical activity or stress is also known to lead to a variability
of the patient’s insulin needs. Therefore, patients with type 1

diabetes often face disorders such as hypo- (BG < 70 mg/dl)
and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dl) due to too large or too
small insulin doses.
The fully automated artificial pancreas could significantly
reduce the hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia events and, thus,
the risk of complications for T1DM patients. A model of insulin and glucose dynamics is required to design a model-based
controller. Many glucose–insulin models have been developed
[4]–[7], tracing back to [8], with various complexity [9]. Unfortunately, as shown in this paper, these models feature apparent
equilibria in fasting periods so that, for each BG value, a different insulin infusion rate is needed to maintain constant BG level.
Real life displays exactly the opposite situation as there is one
single-insulin infusion rate, known as the basal rate, which does
not depend on the value of the glycemia, and which ensures the
equilibrium of any value of the glycemia in fasting periods.
The consequence is that:
1) most of these models enable a short-term BG prediction
from 30 min to 5 h [7], [10]–[12] or can fit with clinical
data for 20 h at most [13];
2) they are unable to describe the tools for the FIT.
The aim of this paper is to introduce a new model which
fits with clinical data for over two days, although it remains
elementary. Its main features rely on realistic stability properties
and a long-term fit. This model is supported by identification
results from clinical data. In addition, the computation of such
FIT tools as the insulin basal rate and the ISF is a byproduct
from this mathematical model.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section II, existing
glucose–insulin models are recalled and the existence of a nondesired equilibrium is argued. The latter may hinder a long-term
fit with clinical data. This section also explains how the previous models are unable to compute FIT tools. The new model
and the identification technique are presented in Section III.
Section IV is initially devoted to analysis of the new model’s
stability properties, after which the tools of FIT are computed
based on its parameters. Finally, the results of parameter identification are presented. The identification is performed for clinical
data with observation duration of a few days. Perspectives and
a scientific discussion are initiated in the concluding Section V.
II. PRELIMINARIES
A. State of Art of Modeling
In 1961, Bolie introduced the first glucose–insulin model and
computed the “coefficients of normal blood regulation” [14],
i.e., for healthy subjects.

MAGDELAINE et al.: LONG-TERM MODEL OF THE GLUCOSE–INSULIN DYNAMICS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES

The Minimal Model, developed by Bergman in 1981, enabled
the estimation of the insulin sensitivity index [8] for healthy subjects and type 2 diabetic patients. This nonlinear model became
very popular [15] and some modified versions are still used in
applications for the artificial pancreas [16].
To overcome some drawbacks of the Minimal Model [4], De
Gaetano introduced the Dynamical Model which is a nonlinear differential delay model. This model was shown to fit with
glucose tolerance test data from healthy individuals [4].
In 2008, the “Uva/Padova T1DM Metabolic Simulator” was
accepted by the Food and Drug Administration for the preclinical testing of control strategies in artificial pancreas studies. This
simulator is based on glucose tracer data of healthy and type 2
diabetes. The parameter distributions were altered to create profiles of 300 type 1 diabetes virtual patients [17]. The parameters
of this model cannot be estimated from standard clinical data
(continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), injection, and amount
of CHO) [17].
The Hovorka maximal model is based on an intravenous glucose tolerance test of six healthy lean male subjects [5]. Nevertheless, this model was shown to describe the 20 h collected
data in 12 young subjects with type 1 diabetes [13]. However,
nonstandard clinical measure of insulin concentration every
30 min and advanced analysis methods [13] are needed to fit
the parameters of the model.
In 2011, a linear model, with digestion dynamics, five states,
and four parameters, was developed to describe the BG postprandial breakfast excursions of a group of ten type 1 diabetes
patients [7] .
B. Functional Insulin Therapy
Improvements in glycemic control have been realized using
“basal-bolus” injection schemes. The basal and bolus amounts
are adjusted for hospitalized patients with a standardized protocol [2]. For outpatients, FIT provides four tools to help the
patient to estimate his insulin needs [3].
1) Basal rate is the constant insulin infusion rate that maintains glycemia at a constant value during fasting.
2) ISF is the glycemic drop per unit of extra insulin when
the basal infusion rate is correctly set.
3) Raise is the resulting increase in BG of digestion of 15-g
CHO when the basal rate is correctly set.
4) U/P is the ratio of U units of insulin and P portions
of CHO. U denotes the required units to recover the BG
value prior to the digestion of P portions of CHO when
the basal rate is correctly set. In this study, one portion
contains 20 g of CHO.
C. Some Drawbacks From Existing Models
What follows may be stated for several models. To be more
concise, we will focus on the Dynamical Model [4] which is
written as
 t
b6
˙
G(τ )dτ + u(t)/Vi (1)
I(t) = −b2 · I(t) +
Δt t−Δ t
Ġ(t) = −b1 · G(t) − b4 · I(t) · G(t) + b7 + J(t).

(2)

1547

The glycemia is denoted G(t) and I(t) is the plasma insulin
concentration (insulinemia). J(t) is an intravenous glucose perfusion rate and u(t) is an insulin infusion rate. Vi is the insulin
distribution volume. The constant increase in plasma glucose
concentration due to constant baseline liver glucose release is
denoted b7 [4]. For most of the newer model, the endogenous
glucose production (EGP) is dependent on glucose [18] and
goes to zero when plasma glucose is high.
It has been proven in [4] that the Dynamical Model (1), (2) is
stable and has an equilibrium point for type 2 diabetic patients
as well as for healthy individuals.
For type 1 diabetics, the pancreas does not secrete any insulin
which leads to b6 = 0. Considering fasting periods (J(t) = 0),
and using b7 as a simple description of EGP, (1) and (2)
reduce to
˙ = −b2 · I(t) + u(t)/Vi
I(t)

(3)

Ġ(t) = −b1 · G(t) − b4 · I(t) · G(t) + b7 .

(4)

The equilibrium point of (3) and (4) is computed in a fasting
period. Setting the right-hand side of (3) to 0, it is found that the
pair (Ueq , Ieq ) is an equilibrium of (3) for any constant insulin
infusion rate Ueq

Consequently, the stable equilibrium Geq for G(t) is found as
Geq =

.

(6)

Any constant insulin infusion rate may yield an apparent equilibrium. This conclusion remains valid whether the EGP b7 is
constant or dependent on insulinemia or glycemia. This result
stands in contradiction with clinical practice.
From (3), (4), and (6), the FIT tools necessarily fulfill the
following equations.
1) The basal rate Ub is computed by solving (6) in Ueq


b7
b2 V i
Ub = Ueq =

− b1 .
(7)
b4
Geq
This value depends on the glycemia Geq . It stands in
contradiction with FIT [2], [3]. In the clinical practice, a
single value of the constant insulin infusion rate, known
as the basal rate, independent from glycemia, maintains
glycemia at any constant value during fasting periods.
2) U/P : The basal rate is assumed to be set to Ub . After
a meal containing CHO without extra insulin injection,
glycemia G(t) would first rise during digestion and then
decrease toward its equilibrium Geq which depends on Ub
(6). Consequently, an extra insulin injection seems not be
required for a meal containing CHO and U/P fulfills:
U/P = 0.

(8)

This stands again in contradiction with FIT: an extra
insulin injection (bolus) is required [2], [3] for every
meal containing carbohydrates. The apparent equilibrium

1548

(Ueq ; Ieq ; Geq ) is asymptotically stable whereas it should
be critically stable for T1DM patients.
Thus, (3) and (4) cannot be used to compute the insulin basal
rate nor U/P.
The model (3), (4) has shown to be efficient to represent the
short-term behavior of the glycemia dynamics but its longterm
validity is affected by its asymptotic properties described above.
III. METHODS
To enable a long-term validity and a fit with clinical data, a
new model with realistic equilibrium points is introduced in this
section . It is an elementary type 1 glucose–insulin and digestion
model with five states and six independent parameters.
A. Glucose Dynamics
The glucose dynamics consists in a single equation, where
Ġ(t) is equal to the production of glucose minus the consumption of glucose.
The increase of glucose includes the liver EGP kl and the
digestion of CHO D(t). The EGP kl is assumed to be constant
for simplicity, but a more accurate model may be derived.
The glucose absorption rate includes the consumption by the
brain kb without need of insulin, the storage by the liver and the
consumption by the muscles under the action of insulin.
The insulin-dependent term of glucose consumption is not
dependent of plasma glucose concentration. A study including
18 T1DM patients [19] shows that insulin action is proportional
to the injection when it is between 0.075 and 0.3 U/kg. This assumption in type 1 diabetes is also supported by hyperglycemic
clamp studies: hyperinsulinc clamp was performed on 16 T1DM
patients in isoglycemic (6.5 mmol/L, i.e., 120 mg/dl) and hyperglycemic (12 mmol/L, i.e., 220 mg/dl) conditions in [20].
Glucose disposal rate and metabolic clearance of glucose were
similar and not statistically different between the two BG levels.
These data support the assumption that the insulin-dependent
term of glucose consumption does not depend on the plasma
glucose concentration. Thus, the insulin-dependent glucose decrease rate is written as −ksi · I(t). Other glucose elimination
phenomena, dependent of glucose concentration, are neglected.
At this stage, the glycemia dynamics is written as
Ġ(t) = −ksi · I(t) + kl − kb + D(t).

(9)

B. Insulin Dynamics
The relationship between the insulin infusion rate, u(t), and
the insulinemia, I(t), is derived from the pharmacokinetic characteristics of insulin [19]. As in [7], the insulin dynamics is
given by a second-order model with a single time constant Tu .
Using U (s) and I(s), the Laplace transforms of u(t) and I(t),
the transfer function is written as
I(s) =

ku /Vi
U (s)
(1 + Tu · s)2

(10)

where Tu is the time constant and ku /Vi the static gain, and Vi
denotes the insulin distribution volume.

C. Digestion Dynamics
A similar second-order system is used to model the relationship between CHO r(t) in meal and D(t). Its time constant is Tr
and it uses the blood volume VB . A state-space representation
of the digestion dynamics is

(12)

To end this section, we will discuss the parameters which
have to be identified. If the body weight M [kg] is known,
three parameters (VB , Vi , and kb ) can be computed using the
following assumptions from [6], [22], and [23].
1) The insulin distribution volume is Vi [dl] = 2.5 M .
2) The blood volume is VB [dl] = 0.65 M .
3) The brain consumes 5 g/h for adults independently of the
body weight even after 12 h fasting:
kb [mg/dl/min] = 5000/60/VB = 128/M.

(13)

The model has six parameters (ksi [mg/U/min], Tu [min], ku
[min], Tr [min], kr [min], and kl [mg/dl/min]) to be identified.
The insulin sensitivity ksi is one major parameter which has to
be identified for each patient as it reflects the well-known variability of the metabolic effect of insulin. The insulin sensitivity
ksi is assumed to be a constant parameter. Thus, the intrapatient
variability effect of insulin is not taken into account in this new
elementary model.
E. Clinical Data and Estimation of Parameters
Standard clinical data (CGM, injection, and CHO) from
Nantes University Hospital and Rennes University Hospital
have been used to support these modeling results. Data from

MAGDELAINE et al.: LONG-TERM MODEL OF THE GLUCOSE–INSULIN DYNAMICS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES

five type 1 diabetic patients using insulin pumps and CGM
(5-min sampling rate) were analyzed.
Four patients were hospitalized: the amount of CHO was
measured by dietitians. They have no physical activity. The
records start with a fasting period.
One patient was an outpatient: the amount of CHO was estimated by the patient himself and there might have been some
physical activity as walking.
The parameters Vi , VB , and kb were derived from the
body weight M . We run offline the least square method on
the n samples of the output error. The optimal value θ∗ =
[ksi Tu ku Tr kr kl ] is the vector of parameters that minimizes
the criterion Jn :

The recursive optimization method of Quasi-Newton is initialized with a rough estimate of vector θ0 found using standard
values of the FIT (basal = 0.35 U/h/kg; ISF = 50 mg/dl/U; raise
= 50 mg/dl/15 gCHO ) and average values taken from [19].
We made the assumption that insulinemia is at equilibrium
and that stomach is empty at the beginning of identification
(I(0) = Ieq = kVui Ueq , D(0) = 0).
IV. RESULTS
In this section, it is proven that the new model (12) features
realistic asymptotic properties. It is also shown that the tools of
FIT can be derived from the parameters of the model (12). This
is a major outcome as these tools are required in therapeutic
education of type 1 diabetic patients and because alternative
models do not provide them. Finally, the identification results
are presented for five patients.
A. Equilibrium
The equilibrium point on a fasting period (D(t) = 0) with a
constant insulin infusion rate u(t) = Ueq is computed solving
Ġ(t) = 0 in (9):


kl − kb

G = Geq ; Ieq =

Consequently, with (10), the only value of u(t) that provides an
equilibrium is
Ueq =

(15)

This result is consistent with FIT, validating the basal rate on
fasting period [2], [3].
Property 1: The equilibrium (14), (15) is unstable.
Proof: See Appendix A

This result is consistent with the observed glycemic deviation
when basal rate is not set correctly [2], [3].

maintains glycemia at a constant value during fasting period.
b
· kVui .
Property 2: Ub [U/min] = k lk−k
si
Proof: Follows from (15).

2) ISF: Assume that the basal rate Ub is injected. The ISF
is the glycemic drop per unit of extra insulin, injected at t = t+
1 ,
on an empty stomach (D(t) = 0).
Property 3: ISF [mg/dl/U] = ksi · kVui .
Proof: See Appendix A.

3) Raise: Assume that the basal rate Ub is injected, the raise
is the resulting increase in BG of digestion of 15 g of CHO,
ingested at t = t+
1 .
Property 4: Raise[mg/dl/15 gCHO ] = 15 × 103 VkBr .
Proof: See Appendix A

4) U/P: Assume that the basal rate Ub is injected, U/P is the
ratio of U units of insulin and P portions of CHO. U denotes
the units, injected at t = t+
1 , required to recover the BG value
prior to the digestion of P portions of CHO, ingested at t = t+
1 .
In this study, one portion contains 20 g of CHO.
Property 5: U/P [U/20 gCHO ] = 20 × 103 k sVi ·ki u VkBr .
Proof: See Appendix A

The parameters from the model (12) allow the computation of
the tools of FIT. Using clinical data, the value of these tools will
be computed for each patient after the identification process.
C. Identifiability
Straightforward but lengthy computations prove that (12) is
identifiable from the standard clinical data (CGM, insulin injection, and amount of CHO) for any u(t) and r(t) such that u̇, ü,
u(3) , ṙ, r̈, and r(3) are nonzero. However, for standard patterns
of insulin infusion rate (u(t) = Ub ) these singularities do exist.
D. Identification Results
Identification results using clinical data are presented in Table I, including parameters and FIT tools, and in Figs. 1–5.
Although the optimization algorithm remains very simple, it
provides a long-term fit with clinical data. The standard deviation is about 20 mg/dl for each patient. The worst value of
standard deviation is for the outpatient LR and might be due to
some incorrect CHO estimation or exercise.
Table I shows the interpatient variability effect of insulin: the
parameter ksi and the ISF are highly variable from one patient to
another. The dispersion in the insulin dynamics parameters Tu
and ku /Vi , reflects the intervariability of the pharmacokinetic
profile of insulin.
Although the identification algorithm is unconstrained:
1) the range of values of Tu (59 < Tu < 122 min) is consistent with the range of the time overshoot (34 < Tu < 112
min) given in [19];
2) the range of values of kl (1.72 < kl < 3.33 mg/dl /min,
i.e., from 1.1 to 2.2 mg/kg/min) is consistent with the
range of the hepatic glucose production in fasting periods
given in [22] (i.e., from 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg/min);
3) the dispersion (from 10 to 83 mg/dl/U) of the value of ISF
is consistent with classical values given in [24] (from 15
to 90 mg/dl/U).

TABLE I
RESULTS OF IDENTIFICATION

Fig. 1.

Patient IF2: M = 72 kg.

For patient IF3, the fasting period (23 first hours) is interrupted by many CHO intakes due to recurrent hypoglycemia.
These are due to too high basal rate as confirmed by the progressive decrease according to the clinical protocol (from 2.0
to 1.0 U/h). This result is consistent with the basal rate value
computed from IF3’s parameters (1.3 U/h; see Table I).
The computed basal rate cannot reflect the basal rate pattern
as for patient LR, IF9, and BE.
The computed values of the tools for FIT are all consistent
with the real insulin needs determined by the clinical protocol.
It is worth noting that those values are also consistent when they
are computed from the identification results on a 20-h record.

V. CONCLUSION
It was shown, in this paper, how historical models of dynamic
BG display apparent equilibria which are not desired. The implication of these equilibria is a basal insulin depending on BG
level. Such equilibria do not exist for real-life T1DM patients.
It is foreseen that using such models will impact the long-term
efficiency of prediction and control of the disease.
To have realistic equilibrium properties, a new model of
glucose–insulin dynamics has been introduced which is linear
and consists of five states and six independent parameters. In
this model, any value of BG is critically stable and there exists
one single basal insulin rate independent on BG.

and the hepatic glucose production respectively. Thus, the computed basal rate (depending on kl ) will not display a basal rate
pattern as used by some patients. Insulin intra-patient variability
(e.g., in case of physical activity or stress) is also not reflected
using the constant parameter ksi . Thus, an online identification
for these parameters may display a basal rate pattern and an
even better fit. These issues remain open for further research.
An effective assessment on how the model impacts the performance of glycemia regulation using model based algorithms
is subject to further investigation as well.

Patient LR: M = 54 kg.

Property 1: The equilibrium (14), (15) is unstable.
Proof: The range of the hepatic glucose production in fasting
periods, from 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg/min, is given in [22] and [23].
With the average value 2 mg/kg/min
kl = 2.M/VB = 3 mg/dl/min.

Patient IF9: M = 68 kg.

Its parameters, identified from standard clinical data, provide
the computation of the tools of the FIT. The latter are all consistent with the real insulin needs determined by the clinical
protocol.
Despite simple linear differential equations and a simple
identification algorithm, the type 1 diabetes model of glucose–
insulin dynamics was shown to describe clinical data for 2 days.
The identification algorithm gives a vector of constant parameters and provides constant values of the FIT tools. Thus, Tr
and kr as well as kl are constant parameters and do not reflect
variability anticipated in the glycemic index of various meals

Definition: Assume t2 − t1  Tr , t2 − t1  Tu . P defines
the meal r(t) = 20 × 103 · P · δ(t+
1 ) and U/P is the ratio, where
U defines the insulin injection u(t) = Ub + U · δ(t+
1 ) such that
