Abstract—To control the southern corn leaf blight, a severe disease of maize around the world, a combination of fungicides is often
more potent than using individual fungicides. However, the number
of possible combinations increases exponentially with the increase
of the number of fungicides combined and their concentrations. It
is thus extremely challenging to identify effective fungicide combinations by trial and error from all possible combinations. In this
paper, a systematic approach based on a support vector machine,
a machine learning algorithm, is proposed to searching for the optimal combinations using only a limited number of measurements.
The constructed model also incorporates information related to
the inhibition rate (IR) and the cost of each composing fungicide
into the optimization process. With this method, we show that only
around 130 measurements on a coarse grid of concentrations out of
thousands of possible experiments are sufficient to reconstruct the
response model and to obtain the optimal fungicide combinations.
Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized combinations
can achieve an IR greater than 90%, while the required concentrations and the cost of individual fungicides are dramatically reduced.
We anticipate that this method should be equally effective in the
search for optimal combinations of multiple compounds in other
diseases.

gredients, and industrial additives. As such, it is an important
crop for the world economy. Southern corn leaf blight (SCLB)
caused by the plant pathogen Bipolaris maydis is one of the
major diseases affecting the cultivation and yield of maize and
is widespread throughout most corn-growing areas. In 1970, a
severe epidemic of the disease prevailed in the United States
Corn Belt, causing serious damage to grain production with an
estimated loss of about 1 billion dollars [1]. Today, this disease
remains a major threat in tropical climates, causing devastating
yield losses of up to 68% [2]. Popular current strategies against
this disease are largely based on the development of resistant
varieties and the application of synthetic pesticides, in which
chemical control has been one of the primary means against
SCLB [3]. However, overuse or abuse of chemical fungicides
has not only generated negative impacts on environment, but
also facilitated the appearance of fungicide resistance in various pathogens. In fact, pathogen resistance to fungicides has
become a major issue in the agriculture worldwide [4].
Since each chemical fungicide has a well-defined mechanism
to kill or inhibit pathogens, a combination of fungicides that
function with different mechanisms should be a promising approach to overcoming pathogen resistance against a particular
fungicide [4]. Such combinations, owing to their possible synergistic effects, could also significantly reduce the dosage of
each compound, improve their efficacy, and reduce their negative effects on the environment. For example, Gary [5] reported
that combinations of active fungicide compounds can achieve
a high degree of phytopathogen control even when the individual compounds have become totally ineffective. In addition,
Valencia-Botin et al. [6] observed that combinations of triazole and quinone are more effective for managing gladiolus rust
than either fungicide applied individually. It is noteworthy that
the drug combination strategy has also been employed to treat
complex human diseases such as cancer by targeting multiple
signaling pathways [7]–[9].
Experimentally searching for optimal combinations of several
effective compounds can be extremely challenging and time
consuming. For instance, if we wish to combine three different fungicides and test ten different concentrations for each, it
would require 1000 independent measurements. This is certainly
a formidable task both in terms of effort and cost. However, it
is also known that the killing process for most fungicides is
achieved through the action of a complex molecular network in
the pathogen. For these complex networks, it has been known
that the response to external disturbances should vary gradually and relatively smoothly [10]–[12]. Thus, in principle, one

can use a limited number of measurements to reconstruct the
entire response function to multiple external stimuli (in our case,
azoxystrobin, polyoxins and armure) [10]. This function, in turn,
should enable one to determine the approximate concentration
ranges of effective combinations at a much lower experimental
load.
Approaches developed in engineering can be applied to
solve such an optimization problem. For human diseases, some
searching algorithms and system modeling methods in engineering have been successfully adapted to optimize the combinatorial therapies, which is well summarized in the review paper by
Feala et al. [7]. For example, using partial least-squares regression, Janes et al. [13] developed a system model of intracellular
signaling to identify the molecular basis for cytokine-induced
apoptosis. Wong et al. [14] implemented a closed-loop control
algorithm using an iterative stochastic search (Gur Game algorithm) for optimal drug combinations against viral infections
of fibroblasts. A mathematical model built on artificial neural
networks [15] was presented by Al-Shyoukh et al. [10] to characterize the response of lung cancer cells to anticancer drugs
and to predict optimum drug combinations.
In this paper, we present a systematic approach to obtaining the optimal combinations of three fungicides based on a
small set of experimental data. We successfully reconstructed
the response model of Bipolaris maydis to these fungicide combinations using a support vector machine (SVM). Compared
with artificial neural networks [10], in terms of solving the
problem of interest in this paper, SVMs can ensure a superior
generalization ability and prediction accuracy by using a small
number of training samples and less learning time [16], [17].
Using this method, the optimized fungicide combinations that
achieved a greater than 90% inhibition rate (IR) were identified
with experimental measurements of only 15% of the total possible combinations. Our results demonstrated that the fungicide
concentrations in the optimal combinations can be as low as onethird of individual fungicides for the same IR. Furthermore, we
find that these combinations achieved a much higher inhibition
efficacy than what would be expected from a simple additive effect of each individual fungicide at those concentrations. Thus,
the reconstructed response model enables a straightforward determination of the optimized combinations of fungicides with a
maximal rate of inhibition at the lowest cost and toxicity.
II. MATERIALS AND METHOD
A. Fungus Culture and Experimental Measurements
Bipolaris maydis race O preserved at the School of Agriculture and Biology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, was used in
the experiments. This fungal strain was grown at 28 ◦ C in a
culture medium of potato dextrose agar (PDA) for 7 days. The
PDA was made in our lab by boiling of sliced (washed and
peeled) potatoes (200 g) in deionized water for 30 min and then
straining it through cheesecloth. Then, agar (15 g) and dextrose
(20 g) were added to the solution and the volume was adjusted
to 1 L [18]. Conidia were collected with sterile deionized water
and adjusted to the concentration at 1 × 106 conidia per mL.
The conidia suspension (50 μL) was cultured in a petri dish of

81

9-cm diameter for five days to be used for the fungicide combination experiments. For each fungicide combination, a pathogen
disc punched along the edge of the fungal colony using a hole
puncher (7 mm in diameter) was inoculated in a plate containing PDA culture medium (20 mL) and fungicides (200 μL)
at different concentrations. All plates were then kept in a dark
chamber at 28 ◦ C for five days. Control plates containing culture medium (20 mL) mixed with deionized water (200 μL)
were included. For each fungicide combination, five replicate
plates were incubated to ensure the reproducibility of the experimental measurements. All culture medium and containers used
in the experiment were sterilized before use.
The fungicides for combination were azoxystrobin
(C22 H17 N3 O5 ), polyoxins (C17 H25 N5 O13 ), and armure (a mixture of difenoconazole, C19 H17 Cl2 N3 O3 and propiconazole,
C15 H17 Cl2 N3 O2 at a 1:1 ratio), that target different cellular
signaling pathways to kill or inhibit pathogens. Azoxystrobin
(Syngenta, U.K.) can suppress the respiration of mitochondria
and prevent the production of adenosine triphosphate in Bipolaris maydis [19], while the polyoxins (Japanese Research Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Japan) interferes with the synthesis of fungal cells cytoderm chitin [20]. By contrast, armure (Syngenta,
Swiss) inhibits the normal synthesis of the cytoderm sterol in
fungi [21].
After the fungal growth in the control dishes was almost complete, the mycelial growth of fungi (mm) in both the fungicide
treated (D) and the control (Dcontrol ) petri dishes were measured
in three different directions (the decussation method [22]). The
percentage of growth IR was calculated using the following
formula:
IR = (Dcontrol − D)/(Dcontrol − Doriginal ) × 100%

(1)

where Doriginal is the diameter of the pathogen discs before
incubation (i.e., 7 mm). With this approach, single-fungicide
concentration IR curves were measured in order to find the
dosage range of each fungicide. Based on the response curves,
nine or ten fungicide dosages were chosen for each fungicide,
which constituted 810 (9 × 9 × 10) combinations in total. The
dosages of individual fungicide were chosen based on the individual concentration IR curves and covered the concentration
ranges aiming to generate a minimal to a maximal inhibitory
effect of fungal growth. Experiments of 150 fungicide combinations based on random selection were performed to construct
the data-driven model for characterizing the responses of fungal
growth to the fungicide combinations.
B. Modeling Method
Although the fungal cell has complex molecular networks
and an understanding of the detailed mechanisms of action of
fungicide response is presently not available, the response of
the Bipolaris maydis cells to the fungicide combinations can be
well represented by a mathematical model described by a response function. As shown in Fig. 1, this model can be viewed
as a system with multi-input and single-output. The input vector x is equivalent to the fungicide combination and the output
y is equivalent to the IR. The noise is added in the model to

simulate environmental disturbances in the experiments, which
can be well described by a Gaussian distribution. Furthermore,
it is known that the response of biological networks to external
disturbances (such as fungicides) is sufficiently smooth [10].
Therefore, we expect that the mathematical model can be constructed based on a small number of experimental measurements. With this model, the best combinations in terms of the
IR and the total cost for each fungicide combination can be
obtained.
The goal of the modeling is to derive a regression function
that has the ability to predict the output of future samples as
accurately as possible from the available samples. In this paper, we use SVM to implement the regression function. SVM is
an effective supervised machine learning algorithm for nonlinear regression analysis [23]. It has been successfully applied to
predict natural gas emissions [24], protein subcellular localizations [25], and hedge financial risks for construction material
suppliers [26].
We briefly recall from [23] the fundamentals of the support
vector regression. Suppose that the given training data is {(x1 ,
y1 ), (x2 , y2 ), . . . ,(xl , yl )} ⊂ Rd × R, where Rd denotes the
space of the d-dimensional input patterns. An SVM model maps
an input vector x ∈ Rd into a high-dimensional feature space
F via a nonlinear mapping Φ and performs linear regression in
this space. The regression function f (x) can be defined as

achieved by minimizing the norm of ω. In particular, in the εSVM regression, the goal is to find a function f (x) deviating
at most by ε from the target yi for all the training data. The

where αi and αi∗ can be obtained by solving the convex optimization problem (10). Using the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions
[27], we can compute b in the ε-insensitive case. The key idea
is to pick the points xk on the margin, i.e., αk or αk∗ in the open
interval (0, C). Here, b can be obtained by taking the average
over all points on the margin xk , as follows [28]:

To specify an ε-SVM, only the kernel function and a regularization parameter C are determined for a given training data
set. In this paper, the model was constructed and coded using
LIBSVM Tools [29] and MATLAB2012a (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA). The radial basis function was selected as the kernel
function
k(xi , xj ) = exp(−g · ||xi − xj ||2 ).

(15)

The main modeling work is to optimize C in the objective
function and g in the kernel function using the training data,
which corresponds to the parameter vector (c, g) in the LIBSVM
Tools.
To determine the required number of experimental measurements for constructing the response function, we have examined
the effects of using varying numbers of experimental points
to fit the model on the accuracy of the prediction. The SVM
model was trained using datasets with different experimental
data points which range from 10 to 140 with a step increase
of 10. To mimic an actual experimental setup, the points were
randomly selected from the 810 possible combinations using a
uniform distribution. The mean relative prediction error for the
method indicates that increasing the number of points reduces
the mean relative error as shown in Fig. 2. However, no significant reduction in the errors was observed for the model with
more than 130 points.
Training the SVM model based on 130 data points, we obtained the optimum of parameter vector (c, g) as (5, 2) using
particle swarm optimization [30]. With this model, all growth
IRs were predicted and the optimal combinations with a satisfactory IR (>90%) were identified.
As a further step to achieving the optimal combinations that
can yield the required IRs with a smaller cost, a cluster analysis
of the combinations was performed taking both the inhibition
efficacy and the cost into consideration. The cost was calculated
as the sum of the costs of the three fungicides according to the
price data listed in Table I.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. Single-Fungicide Response Concentration Curves
The fungicide response concentration curves were measured
for each of the three fungicides in order to find the appropriate
concentration ranges (xc ) for combination (see Fig. 3 ). In our
experiment, azoxystrobin cannot yield a 100% IR even when
using the undiluted stock solution. The single-fungicide concentration curves can be fitted using an s-function
IR = 100/(1 + a · exp(b · xc )) × 100%

(16)

where a and b are coefficients which can be fitted using experimental data from single fungicide.
So as to implement the combination experiments most conveniently, nine different concentrations of each of azoxystrobin
and polyoxins were prepared, and ten concentrations of armure
was prepared (as listed in Table II). Therefore, there are a total
of 810 different possible combinations of these three fungicides
here.
B. Modeling and Performance Evaluation
A set of 130 randomly selected experimental data points were
used to construct the data-driven model which describes the relationship between the fungicide combination and the IR of

fungal growth using SVM. We obtained a correlation coefficient of 0.97 and mean relative error of 9.5 × 10−5 , indicative
of a well-constructed data-driven model. To confirm that this
model can be employed to predict the fungal growth response
to other fungicide combinations than in the initial test sample,

we performed experiments of an additional 20 combinations.
The experimental and predicted data of these 20 combinations
yielded a correlation of 0.92, demonstrating that this model indeed predicted an accurate fungal response. Fig. 4 shows the
correlation between the predicted IRs by the model and the experimentally measured IRs corresponding to the 150 fungicide
combinations. In the figure, there are five data points that are
outside the 15% error lines. We observed in these five experiments that densities of fungi were dramatically lower than most
of experiments judged by the colors of fungi discs, leading to
larger uncertainties in the measurements.
With this model now established, all IRs corresponding to
the 810 possible combinations can be predicted using the datadriven model. As a result, the optimal combinations which give
the desired IRs can be identified. More importantly, the model
provides us with the capability to take other optimization objectives, for example, the cost of the compounds, into the optimization process. The fungicide cost is an important factor
owing to the large quantity frequently used to treat the crops.
Therefore, the preferred fungicide combinations should not only
completely inhibit or kill the fungal growth but also cost as little
as possible.
For this purpose, we selected, by exhaustive search, the combinations which meet the following criteria: 1) the IR is greater

than 90%; and 2) the cost of each single fungicide in the combination is less than the maximum cost (MC) indicated in Table I.
A set of 137 combinations was identified as satisfactory and
are shown in Fig. 5. To achieve the optimal concentration range
for each fungicide, these 137 combinations were clustered into
3 groups (Groups A, B, and C) using the k-means cluster algorithm [31]. Points were grouped as one cluster when their
Euclidean distance to the mean of that group was minimized.
The obtained clusters are shown in Table III. It is clear that the
concentration ranges associated with group C are the best choice
against SCLB using this fungicide combination strategy. Within
the concentration ranges of group C, 16 fungicide concentration
combinations were randomly selected to evaluate the predictions. All measured IRs corresponding to the 16 combinations
were better than 93%, confirming the predictions.
With these results, we compared the dosages and the costs
required to achieve the IR of 90% using single fungicide with
those using optimized fungicide combinations. The results are
presented in Fig. 6 and Table IV. Clearly, the combination approach can significantly reduce the fungicide concentration and
the cost, demonstrating that our approach is effective. More importantly, we also analyzed and compared the IR achieved by
each fungicide combination with the sum of IRs achieved by the
three individual fungicides in that fungicide combination at the
same concentrations. The data of four fungicide combinations
are shown in Table V. It is evident that the combined treatment shows a dramatically higher IR than the sum of IRs of the

combination is not a simple additive effect of each compound.
Although these results did not rely on the details of the molecular network at play, the incorporation of such knowledge into
the model, as suggested by Feala et al. [7], may significantly
improve the power of the model, and may allow a direct delineation of the synergistic actions between the specific molecular

IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a systematic and quantitative approach was implemented to search for optimal fungicide combinations for inhibiting Bipolaris maydis infestation. Using a machine learning
algorithm, a data-driven model describing the relationship between fungicide combination and the IR of fungal growth was
constructed based on a limited number of experimental measurements. With this model, the optimized combinations, which
yielded high IRs and low costs, were identified. These predictions were confirmed by direct experimental measurements,
thus demonstrating the power of this approach in searching for
optimized fungicide combinations against SCLB. Furthermore,
the combinatorial use of fungicides aimed at complementary
pathways achieved a much higher efficacy than that would have
been expected from a simple additive effect of each compound.
We believe that this systematic approach is well suited to develop effective fungicide combinations that not only can lower
the dosage of application but also improve the inhibition of
microbe growth for pest control and crop protection.
