and Imaging Data

and Aristotelis A. Chatziioannou, Member, IEEE

Abstract—Multimodal data combined in an integrated dataset
can be used to aim the identification of instrumental biological actions that trigger the development of a disease. In this paper, we
use an integrated dataset related to cutaneous melanoma that fuses
two separate sets providing complementary information (gene expression profiling and imaging). Our first goal is to select a subset
of genes that comprise candidate genetic biomarkers. The derived
gene signature is then utilized in order to select imaging features,
which characterize disease at a macroscopic level, presenting the
highest, mutual information content to the selected genes. Using information gain ratio measurements and exploration of the
gene ontology tree, we identified a set of 32 uncorrelated genes
with a pivotal role as regards molecular regulation of melanoma,
which expression across samples correlates highly with the different pathological states. These genes steered the selection of a
subset of uncorrelated imaging features based on their ranking according to mutual information measurements to the selected gene
expression values. Selected genes and imaging features were used
to train various classifiers that could generalize well when discriminating malignant from benign melanoma samples. Results on the
selection on imaging features and classification were compared to
feature selection based on a straight forward statistical selection
and a stochastic-based methodology. Genes in the backstage of
low-level biological processes showed to carry higher information
content than the macroscopic imaging features.

I. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK
UTANEOUS melanoma (CM) is a complex multifactorial disease as both environmental and genetic factors
are involved in this cancer manifestation [1]. CM is an often,
fatal neoplasm, derived from melanocytes, that accounts for
most skin cancer deaths. In the advanced stages of this cancer,
therapeutic intervention usually fails to improve survival de-

spite recent advances in the immunotherapy. According to the
World Health Organization, 132 000 melanoma skin cancers
occur globally each year and the global incidence of melanoma
continues to increase, with the known main factor that predisposes to its development being the recreational exposure to the
sun.
The complexity of cellular metabolism and regulatory pathways involved have until recently, obstructed the formulation
of a unified description of melanoma mechanism [2]. Thus, despite the derivation of gene signatures for various cancers, e.g.,
breast or colon cancer, yet a similar progress remains elusive for
malignant melanoma. Potentially this could be attributed to the
intricate nature of the molecular basis of CM, which requests
neatly stratified epidemiological cohorts to address effectively
the issue of the high heterogeneity of the disease. In any case, genomic studies are limited by the shortage of similar melanoma
cohorts, collecting and maintaining frozen tumor tissue thus
rendering gene expression profiling studies of melanoma relatively scarce [3]. In [3], Winnepenninckx et al. studied patients
that were followed-up and identified 254 genes, which expression was associated with metastatic dissemination of cutaneous
melanomas. Lately, Raskin et al. [4] used transcriptome profiling of primary melanomas, metastases, and normal skin samples. They revealed that the transcription factor HMGA2, previously unrecognized in melanoma pathogenesis, is significantly
up-regulated in primary melanoma and metastases. A number
of important emerging biological pathways and gene targets
recently identified in melanoma are reported in [5]. Key biological pathways where several important genes (e.g., CDKN2A,
CDK4, RB1) are involved include proliferation, transcriptional
control, extracellular matrix remodeling, glutamate signaling,
and apoptosis.
The majority of the existing systems of digital dermoscopy
focus on the detection of malignant melanoma and its discrimination from dysplastic or common nevus. The most common
installation type seems to be the video camera, obviously due to
the control features that it provides [6], [7], while still camera, infrared, or ultraviolet illumination are popular choices
as well [8], [9].
Various approaches based on image analysis and using notions from the traditional visual inspection exist for the diagnosis
of melanoma lesions. The Menzies scale, the seven-point scale,
the total dermoscopy score based on the ABCD rule, and the
ABCDE rule comprise some examples. The ABCD rule investigates the asymmetry (A), border (B), color (C), and differential

structures (D) of the lesion and defines the basis for a diagnosis by a dermatologist [10]. The seven-point scale [11] refers
to seven criteria that assess both the chromatic characteristics
and the shape and/or texture of the lesion, each one contributing to the final assessment with a different weight. Neighboring
gray-level dependence matrix and lattice aperture waveform set
are two textural approaches used for analyzing the pigmented
network on skin lesions [12]. In addition, color texture might
be used for determining the nature of melanocytic skin lesions
[13].
As human interpretation of image content can be subjective,
advanced computerized techniques may aid clinicians in the diagnostic process [14], [15]. In this context, expert computer systems have been proposed as alternatives to the naked-eye expert
prediction. The extracted dermoscopy image features that are
used for automated lesion characterization are usually the ones
that are associated with color in various color spaces (RGB, HIS,
CIELab) [16], [17]. Other common features that are used for automated lesion characterization are associated with asymmetry
and border [18] or intensity [9]. The most common classification methods are the statistical and rule-based ones [19], [20],
while more advanced methods like support vector machines
[21] and neural network [22] have also been applied. Comprehensive review of image analysis techniques and computerbased systems used for the early detection of CM appear in
[23] and [24].
The use of biomedical data from different sources, so called
multimodal datasets, is of known importance in the context
of personalized medicine and health data management. Their
importance is strengthened in the case of multifactorial diseases, like CM, which are promoted by an interplay between
genetic factors and the environment. Different data linked together can help toward a holistic approach of the disease, and
for the evaluation and comparison of various subsets of markers
(genetic/environmental factors, imaging features). In the context
of virtual physiological human, an integrated framework should
promote the interconnection of predictive models pervading different scales. The final goal would be the interconnections of
predictive models defined at different scales into systemic networks that provide a holistic description of the disease [25],
[26]. In the case of cancer research, data from clinical studies
(age, sex, size, or grade of tumor size, image extracted features)
can be integrated with gene expression data from microarray
experiments [27].
In this paper, we aim to associate macroscopic CM disease descriptors, i.e., imaging features from dermoscopic examinations,
and low-level biological information, i.e., gene expression, to
CM disease status and compare their information content. The
ultimate goal is the derivation of a compact set of imaging features, which filters out most of the confounding part from the
initial imaging descriptor set. In addition, the resulting compact set of imaging features would be characterized by reduced
computational cost. More importantly, dermoscopy represents
a noninvasive, extremely easy in its implementation, pain-free
examination. In this sense, the derivation of a highly informative, well performing set of imaging descriptors, to be used

191

as a prognostic classifier for the case of CM would represent
an important breakthrough in the therapeutic management of
melanoma.
For our purposes, two different datasets related to CM are
used. Data come from two separate sets of subjects that are described either by molecular features (gene expression) or imaging features and have previously been used by authors to produce an integrated data set by applying data imputation methods
[28]. We use here several instances of the derived, integrated
dataset by the application of various data imputation methods.
Using statistical entropy-based methods and functional analysis
through exploitation of the gene ontology (GO) tree, we derive
a gene signature for CM. This gene set is further used for the
derivation of a narrowed subset of imaging features, with predictive value concerning CM, by prioritizing imaging features
based on their mutual information to selected genes. Discrimination of malignant melanoma samples from the benign ones is
done by feeding a series of classifiers with the selected imaging
features subset. Results are compared to the classification results
obtained using gene signature for samples discrimination and
the results obtained using imaging features selected either solely
by statistics to the target variable (malignant versus benign) or
by a stochastic methodology that utilizes a genetic algorithm
(GA). Overall, the selection of imaging features based on the
gene signature provides added value to the discrimination power
of the selected imaging features. However, and in line with our
expectations, the selected imaging biomarkers subset derived
here performs worse to the gene signature, as the molecular
description of the disease represents a much denser descriptor
set.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Section II,
we describe the utilized data and the creation of the integrated
multimodal dataset. Section III presents the proposed methodology, while Section IV provides and discusses the experimental
results.
II. DATASET CREATION
The integrated dataset presented here is formed from two different sources (microarrays and imaging), which are described
as follows. Then, the methodology for producing the dataset
using data imputation methods is presented.
A. Microarrays Data and Preprocessing
Gene expression profiling dataset was found in the gene expression omnibus [28], [29], GDS1375. RNA was isolated from
45 primary melanoma, 18 benign skin nevi, and 7 normal skin
tissue specimens and used for gene expression analysis. The
Affymetrix Hu133A microarray chip was used for expression
profiling and contained 22 000 probes. After global normalization and log transformation of gene expression values, the
mean gene vector concerning the normal skin categories was
subtracted from all replicate vectors of the other two categories.
Ratios of differential expression were calculated by dividing
the signal intensities of each category by the respective gene
value of the normal category. The differentially expressed gene

values of the melanoma versus skin, and nevi versus skin, were
then analyzed. An FDR for multiple testing adjustment, p-value
0.001 and a two-fold change thresholds were applied, and thus,
1701 genes were statistically preselected.
B. Imaging Data
The imaging dataset comes from a skin lesion images set and
contains 972 instances of nevus skin lesions and 69 melanoma
cases. Three types of imaging features were calculated as follows: border Features that cover the A and B parts of the ABCDrule of dermatology, color features that correspond to the C rules,
and textural features that are based on D rules [30]. A total of 31
features (see Table I) were produced (one feature was removed
due to having zero variation across the samples). The relevant
preprocessing for all features is described in [30].
C. Integrated Dataset
Microarray and imaging datasets were unified into single
datasets using missing value imputation methods, as already
described in [28]. Prior to missing value imputation, the dataset
corresponded to a sparse matrix containing 1104 samples (benign or malignant samples, either from microarray data or
imaging data) and a total of 1732 features (gene expression
or imaging features). Two algorithms were used for missing
value imputation: uniform data imputation and bootstrap data
imputation [28]. The uniform imputation is conducted by sampling uniformly within the range of each feature per class, and
the bootstrap imputation by independent bootstrapping of each
variable separately per class, until all the missing values are
replaced. Each algorithm was applied three times and a total of
six datasets were derived. All of the derived datasets are used
with a double scope: 1) apply statistics to enlighten the interrelations of imaging features and genes and their impact to the
target variable (malignant versus benign) toward the selection of
narrowed subsets of imaging features or genes, and 2) evaluate
more extensively the selected subsets of features when input to
classification algorithms.

III. METHODS
A. Features Selection (Genes/Imaging) Based on Functional
Analysis and Information Gain
The GO was used in order to explore the underlying functional
content beneath the set of 1701 genes differentially expressed
between the benign and malignant melanoma samples. To this
end, the GORevenge algorithm developed by the authors [31]
was used. GORevenge exploits graph-theoretical algorithmic
methodologies and systematically exploits the GO tree in order
to aid the elucidation of hidden functional regulatory effects
among genes.
As a means of inferring potential functional cliques among
genes, GORevenge uses a stepwise mechanism, starting from
the initially considered gene set. In the first (agglomeration)
phase, genes are collected given their links to a given GO term,
and to its neighboring ones, as well its parents and children
GO terms. These genes are considered to belong to the same
functional clique, which is defined by the use of distance-based
functional similarity criteria. Then, for genes that are annotated by several terms, a pruning phase follows. GORevenge
is able to probe specific categories of the GO, i.e., molecular
function (MF), biological process (BP), and cellular component (CC). The output is a list of genes prioritized based on
the linked GOs to them after the pruning stage, thus measuring the centrality of the genes in the functional mechanism
that is proposed by the initial list of genes. In the final list of
genes, each gene is also marked whether it was included in the
submitted input list of genes of the algorithm or not. GORevenge was applied here twice, once for exploring GOs related
to MF and once for GOs related to BP aspect, and was input
by the set of 1701 genes. Resnik semantic similarity metric
and the bubble genes algorithm were utilized with a relaxation
parameter equal to 0.30 [31]. Only the genes that were both
outputted by GORevenge and were simultaneously contained in
the set of differentially expressed genes were selected for further
processing.
The entropy-based information gain (IG), also known as
Kullback–Leibler divergence [32], was also calculated for the
set of 1701 differentially expressed genes in respect to disease status (malignant versus benign). Specifically, genes were
ranked based on their IG ratio values [33], measured as the mean
value of IG ratios in all six datasets (three uniform and three
bootstrap) derived by the two data imputation methods. Genes
with an IG ratio value in the top 20% (340 genes) were selected
as the most informative ones in terms of variability. Genes with
relatively high IG and genes with a central regulatory role in
the underlying active molecular networks (after applying the
GORevenge algorithm) represent genes with mutually independent characteristics. Therefore, an intersection of the high IG
valued gene set with the functionally related GORevenge gene
sets may possibly reveal the highly informative critical molecular players involved in the development of CM. The two GORevenge output lists (MF, BP) were, thus, intersected with genes
that presented high IG and 32 genes found common comprised
the gene signature presented here.

VALAVANIS et al.: EXPLORING ROBUST DIAGNOSTIC SIGNATURES FOR CUTANEOUS MELANOMA UTILIZING GENETIC

The set of 31 imaging features was also evaluated in terms of
IG ratio in respect to disease status (malignant versus benign)
and were prioritized according to IG ratios obtained.
B. Further Selection (Genes/Imaging) by Total Variance
of Feature Subsets—Prioritizing Imaging Features
From the subsets of 32 selected genes and 31 imaging
features, the correlated features were removed (|correlation
coefficient|>0.8) in order to remove redundant features. No
redundancies was found in the genes subset, while some of
the imaging features (8 out of the 31) were removed as were
found correlated with other imaging features (See Section IV).
The ranked selected genes and imaging features according to
IG ratios in respect to disease status were used in order to
collect a subset of features (genes or imaging) that carries
an adequate total variance (TV) to the disease status. Thus,
the TV was calculated for incremental subsets, the first one
corresponding to the first ranked feature and the last one to
the full set of selected features (post all previous feature selection applied). TV was calculated as the total of normalized IG ratios (IG ratio/sum of IG ratios of all features) for
the features included in each of the incremental feature subsets formed. A threshold of TV >= 80% was used to progressively narrow down the genes or imaging features already
selected.
In a next step, we used the genes obtained by the functional
analysis and statistical filters described earlier (n genes) to prioritize the imaging features (m features) according to their mutual information content to the expression values of the selected
genes. That is, we investigated how much each of the m imaging
features is correlated to each of the genes found to be a critical
molecular player. To this end, we calculated mutual information (MI) between each of the m imaging features and each of
the n selected genes. This yielded a mutual information matrix
(n × m) and its values were then used to sort the imaging features per gene. Finally, we got a prioritized list of the m imaging
features per gene according to their mutual information content
to the gene expression values, and in total, n prioritized lists
were obtained.
C. Classification
The resulted genes subset and imaging features subset were
tested for their classification potency (malignant versus benign)
using a series of popular classifiers. We evaluated four features
subsets: genes obtained through functional analysis and IG ratios
(32 genes), imaging features based on their IG ratio in respect
to disease status (malignant versus benign), imaging features
obtained by prioritizing imaging features based on their MI to
the selected genes, and imaging features selected by a stochastic
methodology that utilizes a GA.
The stochastic feature selection method uses a GA [34] to
select the most robust features that feed an internally used,
1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) classifier [35]. GA mimics the mechanisms of natural evolution and applies biologically inspired
operators on a randomly chosen initial population of candidate
solutions, in order to optimize a fitness criterion. In the cur-

193

rent study, an initial population of 100 random chromosomes
is created during the first step of the GA. Each chromosome,
representing a candidate solution for the feature selection task,
is a binary mask of N binary digits (0 or 1), equal in number
to the dimensionality of the complete features set, that reflect
the use (or not) of the corresponding feature. The genetic operators of selection, crossover, and mutation are then applied
to the initial generation of chromosomes. The selection operator selects, through a roulette wheel scheme, the chromosomes to participate in the operators of crossover and mutation,
based on the fitness value of each chromosome previously calculated, i.e., the total accuracy (number of samples correctly
classified) that the corresponding feature subset yields using
the 1-nn weighted classifier on a three-fold cross validation
basis. The whole procedure is repeated until the stopping criterion of attaining a maximum number (50) of generations is
reached.
For each of the feature subsets, four classifiers were constructed and evaluated in terms of generalization using separately all six datasets (three uniform and three bootstrap) derived
by the two data imputation methods used here. Specifically,
two weighted k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers (k = 1, 30)
[35], a decision tree (DT) [36], and the random forest (RF)
algorithm [37] were used. Their performance was measured using three-cross validation resampling. Sensitivity measurements
(true positive/(true positive + false negative) for each of the two
classes in all six datasets and mean values were calculated and
used to compare the selected genes subset and imaging features
subset. For our classification purposes, appropriate workflows
were built using the RapidMiner platform [38], [39].
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
GORevenge analysis (MF and BP aspects) resulted in total
of 179 genes found in the original list of 1701 differentially expressed genes. Out of this subset of genes, 32 genes had an IG
ratio in the top 20% of all 1701 genes. These genes, presented
in Table II, are characterized by a high information content
measured with entropy-based statistics (mean IG ratio > 0.81)
and are coupled to a central regulatory role as derived by the
GORevenge analysis. These genes comprise a gene signature
underlying CM manifestation, on the basis of the available gene
expression profiling data. No correlation redundancies (|correlation coefficient| > 0.8) were found in the gene set. The TV each
of the incremental genes subset, starting from the first ranked
gene based on IG ratio up to all 32 genes, was calculated and
is listed in Table II. TV measurements show that a gene subset comprising of 26 genes (MAP3K4, CTSB, . . . ,PBX1, see
Table II) carries most of the variation content to the disease
status and corresponds to measurement of TV > 0.8. The utilization of this total variation criterion can be used to further
narrow down the dimensionality of the set of selected genes
set.
The imaging features were found to be less associated with
disease status (malignant versus benign) than genes according
to IG ratios (see Table I). The top ten imaging features (top
ten features in Table I in bold) with an IG ratio > 0.15 were

selected as the ones that comprise an imaging feature subset
derived based solely on statistics, i.e., the information content
to disease status based on IG ratios.
Correlated imaging features (|correlation coefficient|>0.8)
were removed from the imaging features subset and 23 imaging
featured were kept (see Table III). The TV each of the incremental imaging features subset carries, starting from the first
ranked gene based on IG ratio up to all 23 uncorrelated features,
was calculated and is listed in Table III. TV measurements show
that a feature subset comprising of 13 features (mean.R, Area,..,
Distance.std, see Table III) carries most of the variation content
to the disease status and corresponds to measurement of TV >
0.8. The utilization of this total variation criterion was used to

further narrow down the dimensionality of the set of selected
imaging features.
We next used the 26 selected genes (TV > 0.8) and the 13
imaging features (uncorrelated imaging features, TV > 0.8) to
prioritize the imaging features according to their correlation
to the genes in the shortest list of critical molecular players.
This was done by ranking the imaging features per gene according to MI values to gene expression values and results are
presented in the Appendix in Table VIII. A careful observation of Table VIII shows that some of the imaging features
are sorted at the very top for all or almost all genes (e.g.,
mean.R, mean.G). Specifically, the top ten imaging features
according to the prioritization overall all 26 selected genes
correspond to mean.R, mean.G, std.R, mean.B, S.std, S.mean,
Dissimilarity, complexity, Grad.mean, and asymmetry. Their
MI measurements to the selected genes (see Table IX) were
found to be in the range (0.056–0.148) showing moderate, yet
existing, mutual information with the genes. These ten imaging features comprise another subset of features that will be
evaluated for the discrimination between malignant and benign
cases.
The GA-based methodology used for imaging features selection was set to yield the best performing ten-dimensional
feature subset, out of the original set of 31 imaging features,
in terms of the accuracy obtained by the internal 1-NN classifier as described in the previous section. After GA convolution, a subset including the features of mean.R, GMSM.mean,
S.mean, L.mean, A.mean, B.mean, B.std, Grad.mean, Grad.std,
and Grad.max.
In total four gene or imaging features subsets were derived
by the methodologies previously described: 1) Thirty-two genes
comprising the gene signature (functional analysis and IG ratios), 2) ten imaging features selected based solely on information content to disease status (IG ratios), 3) ten imaging features
selected based on the prioritization to the list of genes carrying a
TV > 0.8 using MI values, and iv) ten imaging features selected
by the GA-based selection scheme.
All four subset of features were input to the classifiers used
here. Sensitivity results for the two classes (malignant, benign)
obtained for all six instances of the integrated dataset and mean
values, are presented for these four features subsets in Tables IV,
V, VI, and VII, respectively.
Results in Table IV show that top genes are able to yield very
good performance metrics. Almost all samples can be correctly
classified, when selected genes are input to the classifiers, with
1-NN and RF classifier being the most well performing. Sensitivity measurements for the malignant class are little worse than
the corresponding ones for benign class and this is related to
the much greater abundance of benign samples in the integrated
dataset.
When combining results in Tables IV, V, VI, and VII, it
is obvious that performance metrics obtained here by the top
genes, are much higher than the ones obtained when imaging features are feeding the classifiers. Regarding the use of
imaging features and the classifiers’ performance, the much
greater abundance of benign samples in the integrated dataset
appears to have a great effect here. Thus, along with the lower

information content of imaging features, the classifiers perform moderately when recognizing malignant samples (maximum malignant class sensitivity in Tables V–VII was found
64%).

When observing Tables V–VII that present results obtained by
imaging features, we extrapolate that results in Table VI (imaging features selected based on the prioritization to the short list
of genes) are overall performing slightly better; in fact in some

196

datasets they improve the sensitivity for the problematic, due to
its heterogeneity, malignant case, above 50%, while retaining
the high sensitivity scores for the benign class. However, the
moderate performance of the classifiers using the imaging features is to be further studied and is targeted to be improved by
utilizing new classification techniques or increasing the number
of malignant cases in the available dataset. Also, the unbalanced abundance of benign or malignant lesions in the dataset
used here sets another challenge that will further be addressed
along with the development of classification architectures.
It is worth noting that there is a partial consistency among the
imaging features subsets derived by the selection schemes described (e.g., mean.R is selected by all three selection schemes,
and L.mean, complexity, and dissimilarity by two out of three
schemes). Moreover, performance metrics obtained for classifiers support the proof of concept of this paper, which suggests
that imaging features segregated and selected based on their
correlation to the gene signature, perform well regarding the
discrimination between malignant and benign sample classes,
and may constitute an improved classifier. Common findings in
the selection of imaging features by all three selection schemes,
represents evidence of the congruence of this biologically inspired selection method with classical ones based solely on
statistics or stochastic techniques.
The 32 selected genes, represent important regulators behind
instrumental biological functions linked to the phenotypic manifestation of melanoma, setting the basis for a valuable molecular
signature with potential diagnostic efficiency. They were obtained from a two-step process, involving entropy based statis-

tics and the exploration of regulatory mechanisms. Their potential role as biomarkers can be supported by the high performance
of classifiers when input by the corresponding gene expression
values. Gene enrichment analysis and the identification of enriched processes (based on GO and/or KEGG pathways), that
will enable a system’s level description of melanoma development, are within our future plans.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we aimed the association of macroscopic CM
disease descriptors, corresponding to imaging features, to lowlevel biological information, corresponding to gene expression.
Toward our purposes, an integrated dataset related to CM was
used to derive a list of 32 genes highly related to CM disease
status that comprise potential CM biomarkers. Statistics and a
biologically inspired selection scheme that measures the impact
of genes to imaging features were used to prioritize a total of 31
imaging features and select the most robust ones. Using suitable
classification techniques, imaging features could discriminate
with a moderate success malignant from benign CM samples.
In this classification task, imaging features were outperformed
by the genes subset selected here as the latter contained much
denser information on the manifestation of CM.
