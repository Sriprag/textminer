Identification of Microsatellites in DNA Using
Adaptive S-Transform
Sunil Datt Sharma, Rajiv Saxena, and Sanjeev Narayan Sharma

Abstract—Microsatellites are tandem repeats of size 1–6 base
pairs, associated with various diseases, DNA fingerprinting, and
also useful in evolutionary studies. A signal processing algorithm
for microsatellite detection, based on adaptive S-transform is proposed. The standard deviation of the Gaussian window kernel of
the S-transform has been optimized for integer periods of interest by maximizing the concentration measure. The time–frequency
plot is generated using optimal standard deviation values. Candidate repeats are marked by comparing the spectrogram values in
the time–frequency plot with a threshold. A preprocessing phase
followed by a verification phase extracts final results from the candidate repeats. Simulation studies on DNA sequences establish the
superiority of this algorithm over other existing methods. Applicability of this algorithm in the analysis of DNA sequences associated
with repeat expansion diseases has also been demonstrated.
Index Terms—Adaptive signal detection, discrete transforms,
DNA, spectral analysis.

I. INTRODUCTION
OMPUTATIONAL analysis of the genomes is an important subject in contemporary research for understanding
the biological functionality of organisms. The detection of DNA
repeats by abinitio methods is of paramount importance, particularly evident in eukaryotes, which are involved in gene variations and regulatory functions on gene expressions. The repeats
in DNA sequences can be classified as tandem and dispersed.
In tandem repeats (TRs), two or more contiguous copies of an
arbitrary sequence of DNA symbols are present, whereas dispersed repeats consist of two or more nonadjacent copies of an
arbitrary sequence. On the basis of the repeat motif (pattern)
size, TRs can be further classified as satellites, minisatellites,
and microsatellites (MSs) [1]. The satellites range in length
from 100 K base pairs (bps) to 1 Mbps with pattern size greater
than 100 bps. The length of minisatellites varies between 1 to
20 Kbps and their pattern size range is 9–80 bps. MSs also

known as short tandem repeats (STRs) have a length less than
150 bps with a pattern size of 1–6 bps.
In perfect tandem repeats (PTRs), exact copies of the repeats are present, whereas due to mutation that includes insertion/deletion (indel) and substitution, imperfect or approximate
tandem repeats (ATRs) are formed in which the exact copies of
the repeat patterns are missing.
Among three types of TRs, MSs are important because of their
documented functions and association with cancer and other
diseases. Microsatellite repeats are responsible for the diseases
such as Fragile-X syndrome, Huntington’s disease, Frederick’s
ataxia, and 40 other neurological, neurodegenerative, and neuromuscular diseases [2]. Microsatellites are more susceptible to
mutations when compared to other regions of the genome and
are often studied to understand evolution. Microsatellites are
also useful in various fields such as forensics, DNA fingerprinting, population studies, linkage analysis, evolutionary studies,
behavior of living organism, etc. [3].
In view of the important role played by MSs, several computational approaches have been proposed, based on which
many algorithms have been developed to identify the periodicity,
structure, location, and copy number of the repetitive patterns
presents in the DNA sequences. Broadly, these approaches have
been divided into two categories: deterministic and stochastic
[4]. There are many probable paths with stochastic models for a
process starting from the known points. The sequence alignment
following stochastic models has been popularly used for microsatellite finding [5]. To reduce the run time of these methods,
heuristic algorithms have also been developed [6]. However, a
prior requirement of the period of the repeat or the basic pattern of the region limits the applicability of these methods. To
overcome many of the limitations of these methods, Benson has
developed a method known as the TR finder (TRF) [7] which
is based on a probabilistic model. The TRF can detect repeats
with larger patterns and its searching ability is dependent on the
values of the matching probabilities and indel probabilities.
DNA sequences can be converted into numeric sequences using various mapping schemes [8]. The numerical representation
of the DNA sequences allows their analysis to be carried out
using signal processing (SP) techniques. A number of deterministic algorithms that use SP methods for the identification
of MSs have been reported. A deterministic algorithm behaves
predictably. Also, SP methods which fall in deterministic class
determine more number of repeats and offer greater sensitivity
toward detection of inexact repeats. SP-based algorithms that
use correlation techniques have been developed for the identification of exonic regions in DNA sequences characterized by
period-3 repeats [9]. As these methods are sensitive to latent

periodicities, they can detect more number of ATRs. Whereas,
because of the more stringent match conditions, it is difficult for
string–matching based algorithms to identify inexact repeats resulting from mutations. SP algorithms based on discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) [10], short time periodicity transform (STPT)
[11], exactly periodic subspace decomposition (EPSD) [12],
quaternionic periodicity transform (QPT) [13], auto-regressive
(AR) model [1], and wavelet-based empirical mode decomposition [14] have been reported recently for the identification of
MSs.
DFT-based spectral repeats finder (SRF) primarily identifies
the repetition periods present in any DNA sequence and subsequently the sequence is scanned at these periods to locate the
approximate regions where the repeat units are contained. The
high-intensity peaks are observed for a large number of exact
TRs in the power spectrum determined with the SRF method,
but the quality of the signal degrades when the DNA sequence
is mutated. To avoid this limitation of the sum spectrum used
by SRF, in [15], the Fourier product spectrum has been introduced to detect weak ATRs. To overcome the deficiencies of
the spectral methods, a time-domain method called the STPT
has been developed [11]. However, both FT- and STPT-based
methods, while detecting ATRs, are not able to tell whether a
repeat is of period p or its multiple, i.e., 2p, 3p, and so on. The
EPSD algorithm developed by Gupta et al. [12] identifies exact
as well as ATRs, and also helps in identifying whether a particular pattern is due to period p or its multiple. The EPSD method
however requires different window sizes with different repeat
periods and no criterion for deciding the window size has been
precisely specified. Another solution, QPT, meant to address the
deficiencies of STPT, like symbol bias, lack of an appropriate
postprocessing stage, and an absence of a strategy for identification of indels has been reported by Brodzik [13]. The QPT
method requires the minimum repeat length to be specified a
prior, and this feature restricts its detection capability. Another
SP method based on parametric spectral estimation (PSE) analyzes the spectrogram of DNA sequences using the AR model
[1]. The AR model is an improvisation over the OMWSA algorithm reported by Du et al. [16]. It has been shown that the AR
model produces a sharp peak and low background noise, while
the FT produces a very noisy back ground. The true order of
the AR model however is not known a priori and an optimal
order has to be determined according to the characteristics of
the data. When the power spectrum of the repeats consists of
several frequencies, then the AR model uses smallest frequency
to calculate the period. This approach leads to a wrong detection
in the cases where the smallest frequency is too weak to be detected. Also, as the length of repeats units are not known before
hand, the AR model requires different window sizes to detect
all repeats in a sequence, for which no criterion is specified.
In this paper, an SP-based algorithm for the identification
of MSs has been developed. The performance of this algorithm is not limited by the aforementioned factors that affect
other SP-based methods. To enhance the detection performance,
time–frequency plots have been obtained using the S-transform.
The standard deviation of the Gaussian window used in the Stransform [17] has been tuned at different periods to maximize

the concentration measure (CM) for better discrimination [18].
In the screening phase, by applying a suitable threshold on the
S-transform spectrograms, the presence of candidate repeats has
been marked. Candidate repeats have been preprocessed to reduce the false detections. The verification phase introduced by
Boeva et al. [19] has been finally used to determine the actual
repeats.
This paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the
S-transform and its optimization to detect MSs. The adaptive
S-transform (AST) algorithm is presented in Section III and
the methodology has been elaborated using a specific example.
In Section IV, the performance of the AST algorithm has been
evaluated on DNA sequences which have been used in earlier
reported works. A comparative study of the AST algorithm with
the TRF [7], PSE [1], and recently reported Empirical Mode and
Wavelet Decomposition (EMWD) [14] has also been carried out
in this section. Section V describes the applicability of the AST
algorithm in the analysis of DNA sequences associated with a
repeat expansion disease. Concluding remarks are presented in
Section VI.
II. ADAPTIVE S-TRANSFORM
The S-transform was proposed by Stockwell et al. [17] to
get a joint time–frequency representation with the frequencydependent resolution, while retaining the absolute phase of each
frequency. The S-transform is conceptually a hybrid of short
time Fourier analysis and wavelet analysis, with inverse frequency dependence of the localizing Gaussian window, and the
phase referenced to the time origin. The S-transform of a signal
u(t) is defined as
 ∞
u (τ ) g (t − τ, f ) exp (−j2πf τ ) dτ
(1)
S (t, f ) =
−∞

where τ represents the time, f the frequency, g the scalable
Gaussian window, and the quantity t is the parameter which
controls the position of the Gaussian window on τ -axis. The
Gaussian window in time domain is defined as

√ 


(2)
g (t) = 1/σ 2π exp −t2 /2σ 2 .
In the S-transform, the Gaussian standard deviation σ is a
function of the frequency and defined as
σ (f ) = 1/ (|f |) .

(3)

Combining (2) and (3) gives
S (t, f ) =

When the S-transform is applied on genomic sequences for
the identification of the TRs, it suffers from poor energy concentration. To enhance energy concentration, frequency-based
window width optimization [20] and modified S-transform [21]
were also tried. However, these modified versions of the Stransform also did not yield satisfactory results because of poor

energy concentration in their time–frequency plots, leading to
weak discrimination of TR regions from their adjacent regions.
In place of imposing constraints on the standard deviation of
the S-transform, Pei and Wang [18] proposed a more flexible
modified S-transform, in which the optimal value of σ (f ) at
frequency f is obtained straightly by maximizing the CM. The
modified S-transform has been defined as
S (t, f ) =

Based on this modified version of the S-transform, the AST
algorithm has been proposed in this paper for the detection of
MS repeats.

III. AST ALGORITHM
The flowchart for the detection of MSs using AST is shown
in Fig. 1. A detailed description of each and every step of the
algorithm is provided in the following sections.
A. Character Sequence Mapping
A genomic sequence comprises of four characters: A, T, C,
and G. O. sativa, which is a short, highly repeated DNA sequence
with accession number X64775 [15] has been selected as an example sequence to explain the working of the AST algorithm. To
analyze this sequence, it is first mapped into an equivalent numeric sequence using complex mapping [8], [11]. The complex
mapping has been preferred as it reduces the computational complexity by 75% as compared to the binary mapping scheme. It
performs the conversion by employing following mapping: A ↔
1 + i, T ↔ 1 − i, G ↔ −1 − i, C ↔ −1 + i, where i stands
for the imaginary unit.

B. Optimization of Standard Deviations
The time–frequency analysis has been performed only for integer periods 2 to12, and not at all bin frequencies, for reducing
the computational load. Although, for microsatellite detection,
the repeat periods only up to six are of interest; to get a sizeable
number of spectrum magnitudes for threshold computation, the
time–frequency analysis has been done upto period 12. The optimization scheme developed by Pei and Wang [18] has been used
to determine the signal- and period-specific optimum standard
deviations. The optimum standard deviations maximize the concentration values. The discrete version of the S-transform and

steepest descent algorithm has been employed to reduce the
computational time [23]. The Steepest descent algorithm carries out the search and finds the value of the standard deviation
that maximizes the concentration at a particular period. Fig. 2
shows the variation in the values of optimum standard deviations
with periods for the sequence X64775.
C. Time–Frequency Analysis
In (11), σ is set to optimum standard deviation values and
time– frequency plot values are computed for X64775 using
(10). The resultant time–frequency plot is shown in Fig. 3. On the
horizontal axis, base positions are marked, and integer periods
are shown along the vertical axis. Integer periods (p) are the
reciprocal of the bin frequencies (fn = nFs /N )[24], i.e.,
p = N/nFs .

(13)

In (13), N is the length of the sequence, n is an integer 0 to
N – 1(frequency index), and FS is the sampling frequency. FS

for the genomic sequence is taken as one, as the consecutive
DNA nucleotides or bps are assumed to be separated in time
by 1 s. So, for X64775, with N = 302, period-2 corresponds
to n = 151. Noninteger values of n are rounded to the nearest
integer and using these values, periods have been marked in
Fig. 3. However, from this plot, it is difficult to establish by
visual inspection the locations of the TRs. Hence, in order to
mark the candidate repeats, spectrum values have been subjected
to the screening phase.

D. Determination of Candidate Repeats
(Screening Phase)
Time–frequency results shown in Fig. 3 have been subjected
to the screening phase for identifying the candidate repeats.
Candidate repeats have been marked using the method described
in [1]. Following steps are required to generate the binaried
time–frequency plot shown in Fig. 5.

values. The time–frequency plot after preprocessing of Fig. 5
results is shown in Fig. 6. Preprocessing has removed the false
detections at periods 2, 3, 7, 11, and 12. These regions are thus
not subjected to the verification phase and helps in reducing the
computational load.

(14)
2) Determine the threshold value H (i) at base position, i
using
H (i) = RS̄ (i) , where i = 1, 2, . . . , N.

(15)

From studies carried out in this paper, R has been set to
1.5.
3) For every base position, compare the spectrum values
(i, p) at different periods and identify the maximum spectrum value, Sm ax (i, p).
4) Except Sm ax (i, p) values assign zero values to other
S (i, p) values.
5) At every i compare Sm ax (i, p) with H (i). If
Sm ax (i, p) > H (i), then assign Sm ax (i, p) a value one,
else assign it zero value.
The values of H (i) and S (i, p) have been plotted together in
Fig. 4. Using aforementioned steps, a binaried time–frequency
plot has been generated for X64775 and is shown in Fig. 5. This
plot provides the candidate repeats for further analysis.
E. Preprocessing of Candidate Repeats
To reduce the computational load during the verification
phase, candidate repeats have been preprocessed to reduce the
number of false TR cases. The length of the different segments
of the candidate repeats at a period is compared with a number
which is twice of the corresponding period. If the length of a
candidate repeat is lp with a period p and if lp < 2p, it is not
considered to be a candidate repeat, as it does not satisfy the condition of minimum two contiguous repeats for a valid TR. The
spectrum values corresponding to this segment are assigned zero

F. Verification Phase
To verify the existence of the TRs in the marked candidate
repeats, a verification method introduced by Boeva et al. [19]
and applied by Zhou et al. [1] has been used. Candidate repeat
sequences shown in Fig. 6 are represented by segments S from
which segment Ŝ containing TRs are to be extracted by the
verification phase. Segment Ŝ is defined by the start and end
positions Xs and Xe , respectively.
Xs and Xe have been determined using two arrays Af (i)
and Ap (i). In the sequence S , the nucleotide at position i of
the genomic sequence is compared with that at position i +
p to extract the TRs with periodicity p. If the symbols at two
locations are identical, then Af (i) is set to 1, otherwise it is set
to 0. Then, the local sum of the Af (i) is calculated to generate
an array Ap (i) as
Ap (i) =

i+p−1


Af (k).

(16)

k =1

To take care of mutations in TRs, the mismatch ratio δ has
been used. For a period p, a value of Ap (i) ≥ δp guarantees a
repeat at index i with mismatch ratio δ. TR sequences have been
generated using following steps:
1) The start position Xs in a TR is the position of minimum
i, which satisfies the two conditions
a) Ap (i) ≥ δp, and
b) Af (i) = 1.
2) TRs is a sequence that satisfies the condition
Ap (i) ≥ δp.
3) The end position is the first position i after the start position
which satisfy the conditions

a) Ap (i − p − 1) ≥ δp, and
b) Ap (i − p) ≤ δp.
A mismatch ratio of 0.6 has been used here and this allows
no mutation in period 2 (Ap ≥ 1.2), one mutation in period 3
(Ap ≥ 1.8), one mutation in period 4 (Ap ≥ 2.4), two mutations
in period 5 (δp ≥ 3), and two mutations in period 6 (Ap ≥ 3.6).
This ratio can be changed to set a different mutation criterion. As
an example, a period 3 candidate repeat sequence S from 108–
122 bps of X64775 is given: S = CGGCGGCGGATCACC
Using aforementioned steps, two Ŝ sequences, first from 108
to 116 (CGGCGGCGG), and second from 117 to 122 (ATCACC) are obtained. When deletion or insertion exists in the
sequence S , more than one Ŝ sequence will be obtained. For

the sequence Ŝ, a candidate repetitive unit pattern with least

considered ATRs as the “fuzzy” repeats with one or more than
one bases replaced by others. “Loose” repeats in the EMWD are
the dispersed repeats. These repeats have not been included in
the comparative study, since the AST, TRF, and PSE algorithms
can identify only TRs and not the dispersed ones. In M65145
period, one repeat has been detected by the EMWD from indices
51–72. The AST algorithm also finds these repeats in almost the
same locations, i.e., from 52–68. However, the detection signals
are observed in period-3 region. Since this is the only segment
containing period one, it has not been included in Table IV for
the comparative study. Period 2 detections by the four methods
are almost the same. However, significantly higher number of
detections is done by the AST algorithm for periods 3, 4, 5, and
6. At these periods, the AST algorithm detects not only more
number of PTRs, but at the same time is observed to be highly
sensitive toward detection of ATRs, particularly with small copy
numbers.
V. AST AND REPEAT EXPANSION DISEASES

M65145 [14], are used in this paper. These datasets are selected
for the comparative study as they have been also used by the
earlier reported methods. TRs in the three datasets have been
identified using the AST algorithm and the results are shown in
Tables I–III along with the detections of TRF, PSE, and EMWD
methods. From these results, a summative record of microsatellite repeats detected by the four methods, for the three sequences
is given in Table IV. Both PTRs and ATRs have been included in
these results. To establish a comparative study same mismatch
ratio of 0.6 as used by the PSE method has been used for the
AST algorithm. However, in the EMWD method, no criterion
for the mismatch ratio has been explicitly specified. They have

The repeat expansion diseases include genetic disorders
caused by long and highly polymorphic TRs [25], [26]. Such
diseases are caused by expansion of noncoding as well as coding region repeats. Unstable trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, and
pentanucleotide repeats lead to a large number of neurological disorders. For example, tetranucleotide expansion in gene
ZNF9 (OMIM no. 602668) [27] leads to mytonic dystrophy
type2 (DM2) disease [26]. The expansion of CCTG repeat in
intron 1 of ZNF9 gene is responsible for DM2. The normal
repeat length is <27, whereas the pathogenic repeat length is
75–11 000. The accession number for homo sapiens ZNF9 gene
with a normal CCTG repeat number is AF388525 and with
expanded repeats is AF388526. These sequences are available

online [28] and have been analyzed by the AST algorithm.
Time–frequency plots obtained after the verification phase of
the AST algorithm for AF388525 and AF388526 are shown in
Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. Corresponding detection results are
described in Tables V and VI. Repeat regions which are responsible for the DM2 disease have been highlighted in Figs. 8 and
9 using hatchings. The expansion of the CCTG region can be
observed in Fig. 9 because of the DM2 disease.

From these results, it follows that the AST algorithm works
satisfactorily when used for the analysis of highly repetitive
DNA sequences associated with repeat expansion diseases.
Gene ZNF9 has also been analyzed by recently reported
FireμSat2 algorithm [29], with its default settings, and the findings are shown in Table VII. Numbers of detections appear to
be considerably large as compared to AST results. However,
the detections suffer from significant overlapping, resulting in
redundant detections. For example, period 4 detections in the
regions 41–57, 106–183, 124–187, and 144–182 are highly over
presented, and similar overlapping are present in other periods
too. Also, in the same regions FireμSat2 detects different periods. In the region 130–175 of the ZNF9 gene, the AST algorithm
detects 11.5 copies of motif CCTG, expansion of which leads
to disease DM2. These results match with the online available
results [28]. On the other hand, FireμSat2 detects different motifs of period 3, 4, and 5 in this region. As these overlappings
lead to ambiguity in deriving interpretations from the output, an
overlap-free version of FireμSat2 is still in progress [29]. Also,
FireμSat2 does not detect period 6 motifs which fall under the
microsatellite category [1], [3]. Apart from these limitations,
the visual representation feature is missing in FireμSat2 . In
contrast, results of AST can be easily comprehended because of
the graphic visualization. The AST algorithm provides a “near
complete” compilation of TRs and the output generated is user
friendly.
VI. CONCLUSION
The AST algorithm proposed in this paper can detect PTRs
as well as ATRs. Its detection performance is observed to be
better than TRF, PSE, and EMWD methods. Numbers of AST
detections are less than FireμSat2 . However, detection of significant TRs with no overlappings and visual representation
with no ambiguity are the positive features of the AST. The
better performance has been obtained by this algorithm as the
AST helped in deciding the optimum window size. The window
size in this method is period- and sequence-specific. However,
the performance of the algorithm is observed to be poor when

be addressed and the algorithm can be generalized to detect
minisatellites as well as satellites.
