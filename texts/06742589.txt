Hemorrhage Control
Mark R. Brinton, Student Member, IEEE, Yossi Mandel∗ , Roopa Dalal, and Daniel Palanker

Abstract—Noncompressible hemorrhage is currently the most
common cause of preventable death in battlefield and in civilian
trauma injuries. Tourniquets, specialized wound dressings, and
hemorrhage-inhibiting biomaterials are not sufficiently effective in
arrest of noncompressible hemorrhage and often cause collateral
tissue damage. An effective, easy-to-use, portable device is needed
to reduce blood loss in trauma patients immediately following injury and to maintain hemorrhage control up to several hours—
until the injured is evacuated to a medical facility. We developed a
miniature electrical stimulator to induce vascular constriction and,
thereby, reduce hemorrhage. Vasoconstriction of the rat femoral
arteries and veins was studied with pulse durations in the range of
1 μs to 10 ms and repetition rate of 10 Hz. Pulse amplitude of 20 V,
duration of 1 ms, and repetition rate of 10 Hz were found sufficient
to induce rapid constriction down to 31 ± 2% of the initial diameter, which could be maintained throughout a two-hour treatment.
Within one minute following treatment termination the artery dilated back to 88 ± 3% of the initial diameter, providing rapid
restoration of blood perfusion. Histology indicated no damage to
the vessel wall and endothelium seven days after stimulation. The
same treatment reduced the blood loss following complete femoral
artery resection by 68 ± 11%, compared to untreated vessels. Very
low power consumption during stimulation (<10 mW per 1.6 mm
electrode) allows miniaturization of the stimulator for portable
battery-powered operation in the field to control the blood loss
following vascular trauma.
Index Terms—Electrical stimulation, hemorrhage control, junctional bleeding, vascular trauma, vasoconstriction.

areas, such as inguinal hemorrhage, and hemorrhage in internal
solid organs, such as the liver and spleen. Hemorrhage from
these areas cannot be successfully controlled using traditional
tourniquets or standard bandages. According to the U.S. military reports, successful implementation of traditional tourniquets significantly reduced hemorrhage morbidity from limb
injury, and now hemorrhage not amenable to truncal tourniquets
(i.e., noncompressible wounds in joints, cavities, and solid organs) is the most common cause of preventable of death [2]–[4].
Recent military data from U.S. and coalition troops reports
that 23% of casualties were potentially survivable, 20% of which
died from junctional hemorrhage [3]. Consequently, an efficient
method of hemostasis could have prevented these casualties. A
device capable of preventing hemorrhage from truncal noncompressible injuries could save an even greater number of lives [4].
Recent efforts to address the problem of noncompressible
hemorrhage include use of hemorrhage-inhibiting biomaterials,
gauze packing, or sophisticated new tourniquets. Biomaterials
and biomaterial-enhanced dressings have been proven effective for some locations and severity of injury, but not all [5].
For example, wound dressings enhanced with fibrin, chitosan
(HemCon), or poly(N-acetyl glucosamine) have inhibited hemorrhage with high efficacy. However, they are less effective
when applied to deep cavity or incompressible wounds [5]–[7].
Similarly, the QuikClot Combat Gauze, a zeolite-based wound
dressing endorsed by the US Army for hemorrhage control not
amenable to a tourniquet, and other enhanced wound dressings, are also ineffective in junctional bleeding (i.e., groin,
gluteal, axilla, shoulder, and others) [1], [3], [5], [8], [9]. In
a powdered form, biomaterials such as QuikClot granules can
be easily poured into deep wounds and conform to irregular
surfaces but can cause tissue damage by exothermic reactions,
may have local or systemic toxicity, and are not biodegradable
and, therefore, must be removed before definitive surgery [5].
WoundStat, a ceramic-based hemostatic powder, was shown to
be more effective than QuikClot granules and HemCon dressing in a porcine femoral artery model [10]. Unfortunately,
WoundStat was difficult to remove from the wounds and it
caused endothelial damage and moderate vein necrosis [10]. Recently, improved control of noncompressible solid organ hemorrhage has been achieved using a polyurethane injection. However, this technique can only be used with closed cavity injuries,
and tissue necrosis was observed as a result of the pressure
increase within the cavity [11]. A new tourniquet, the Combat Ready Clamp (CRoC), approved by the FDA for prehospital hemorrhage control, can only be used for inguinal hemorrhage and cannot be applied to the head, neck, abdomen,
and chest [12], [13]. Animal and cadaver studies indicated the

CRoC’s effectiveness; but as of 2012, there was only one anecdotal report of its effective use in patient care, despite hundreds
being deployed [13]. A similar clamp targeting the aorta has
been proposed to arrest inguinal hemorrhage [14].
In the current study, we evaluate a novel method of hemorrhage control, based on electrical stimulation of blood vessels
with microsecond pulses [15], [16]. Though vasoconstriction
was long reported in response to direct electric current, it was
accompanied by tissue damage [17], [18], probably due to excessive heating or electrochemical reactions caused by the charge
imbalance. Charge-balanced pulsed electrical stimulation, on
the other hand, can avoid irreversible electrochemical reactions
and tissue damage at the electrode–tissue interface [19]. Pulsed
electrical stimulation of chicken embryo caused vasoconstriction in 10 s and thrombosis after 3 min [20]. Recent studies
using microsecond and millisecond pulses have demonstrated
vasoconstriction and reduced bleeding in femoral and mesenteric vessels in rats or in injured liver in rabbits, without tissue
damage [15], [16].
In the current paper, we describe an effective, easy-to-use,
portable device for hemorrhage control, which should help minimize bleeding until the injured is evacuated to a medical facility [21]. We explore the feasibility of providing sustained vasoconstriction for several hours using a portable, battery operated
miniature stimulator.
II. METHODS
Based on evaluation of the vasoconstriction thresholds in our
previous studies [16] and in current experiments, we elected to
design the portable device to operate at 20 V due to the following reasons. First, 20 V provides vasoconstriction sufficient to
reduce vessel diameter by a factor of 3, cross-sectional area by a
factor of 9. Second, 20 V can be simply and inexpensively supplied using a stack of several 3-V coin batteries, eliminating the
need for bulky, power consuming voltage converters. Third, the
use of low-voltage components and integrated circuits greatly
reduce the device size and cost.
A. Animals
Male, wild-type Long Evans rats, aged 50–60 days, were
used for this study (Charles River, Wilmington, MA). The average animal weight was 263 g. Animals were anesthetized with
75 mg/kg Ketamin HCl and 5 mg/kg Xylazine. An additional
half dose was given every 45 min, when necessary. Buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg) and Hartman’s Lactated Ringer Solution
(114 ml/kg/24 h, 37 ◦ C) were administered subcutaneously at
the beginning of the experiment for pain control and hydration.
Animal experiments were approved by the Stanford Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care.
B. Surgery
With the animal in the supine position, the internal temperature was monitored and held to 37 ± 1 ◦ C using a heating pad.
The femoral artery was exposed by removing the skin and fascia. Hartman’s Lactated Ringer solution (37 ◦ C) dripped onto

across and equidistant from the vessels. Disc electrodes represent the exposed

the surgical site throughout surgery and experiments. After exposure, the vessel was allowed to acclimate for 15 min before
any experiments were performed.
C. Vessel Stimulation and Data Collection
Stainless steel wires (3 N8 purity, EPSI Metals, Ashland,
OR) were coated with insulating spray, except for the circular
end-face, to create 1.6-mm diameter stainless steel disc electrodes. Since the stimulation target is the blood vessels, the two
electrodes spaced 4 mm apart were placed with the artery and
vein centered between them (see Fig. 1). Monophasic, anodic
pulses were generated using a customized pulse generator. A
10-μF capacitor between the generator and one of the electrodes assured charge balance of each pulse cycle. Stimulation
waveforms were captured and monitored using an oscilloscope
(Tektronix 3034 B, Beaverton, OR). Current was calculated
from the voltage drop across a 10-Ω series resistor. The effect
of pulse duration on vasoconstriction was studied for 1, 10, and
100 μs, and 1 and 10 ms pulses of 20-V at 10-Hz repetition rate.

Fig. 2. Normalized vessel diameter during stimulation with various pulse
durations. The 20-V amplitude and 10-Hz repetition rate remained constant,
while the pulse duration was swept from 1 μs to 10 ms, changing by a factor
of 10 every 10 min. Vessel diameter was recorded every 2 min and within 15 s
after the change in pulse duration. At 50 min, the stimulation was terminated
and the vessel relaxed. Error bars show SEM. The difference between the
average arterial constriction obtained with 100-μs and 1-ms pulses was highly
significant: p = 0.01 (n = 5).

Sustained electrical stimulation was applied for 120 min using
20-V, 1-ms pulses at 10-Hz repetition rate.
The blood vessel lumen diameters were measured from the
images captured with a digital camera (TC202 USB-A, Sentech
Inc.) using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The bleeding
rate from the arterial injury was measured using blood collection with preweighed KimWipes. Using the weight change and
knowing the blood density (1060 mg/ml), the collected blood
volume was calculated. In the bleeding experiments, stimulation was applied with 1-ms pulses at 10-Hz repetition rate using
20- and 100-V amplitude. All results are presented as
mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was determined using
the Student’s t-test.
D. Histology
After stimulation, the skin and fascia were closed using a 6–0
silk suture. After seven days, the vessel stimulation site was
once again exposed and 10% buffered formalin was applied
topically for 20 min. After euthanasia, the vessel was dissected
and immersed in 10% buffered formalin overnight. The tissue
was then dehydrated with a graded series of ethanols, fixed
in paraffin, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E).
III. RESULTS
A. Effect of Pulse Duration on Vessel Constriction
To explore the effect of pulse duration on vessel constriction,
20-V stimulation pulses were applied for 10 min with pulse
durations of 1, 10, and 100 μs, and 1 and 10 ms at a 10-Hz
repetition rate. As shown in Fig. 2, no response was observed
for 1- and 10-μs durations, but within seconds of applying the
100-μs pulses, the artery constricted to 50 ± 6% of the original

diameter during 120-min-long stimulation, and dilated to 88 ± 3% within 1 min

diameter. The artery further constricted to 30 ± 5% with 1-ms
pulses (p = 0.01), while the vein only constricted transiently
to 86 ± 6%. The 10-ms pulse duration added only transient
improvement to arterial response: after initial constriction to
19 ± 1%, the artery slowly dilated back to 28 ± 2%. However,
the vein constricted to approximately 60 ± 4%.
B. Sustained Vasoconstriction
Two important characteristics of a hemorrhage control device
are its ability to 1) maintain vasoconstriction and prevent blood
loss for a few hours, until the patient is evacuated, and 2) rapidly
restore the flow when patient arrives at the definitive treatment
center. The 20-V, 10-Hz, 1-ms stimulation was able to sustain
the constriction of the femoral artery for two hours, which then
rapidly recovered to its original diameter after stimulation ended
(see Fig. 3). The artery constricted initially to 31 ± 2% and then
gradually dilated to 44 ± 4% during the two hours of stimulation.
Interestingly, the vein constricted only transiently to 81 ± 7%,
and dilated to 110 ± 6% of the initial normalized diameter
during the first 15 min. After the end of stimulation, the artery
recovered to 88 ± 3% of its diameter within one minute. Vessel
histology at 24 h (not shown) and one week after stimulation
(see Fig. 4) did not show any obvious damage caused by the
prolonged stimulation.
C. Control of Blood Loss in Severe Arterial Injury
To assess the rate of blood loss in severe injury of the femoral
artery, it was completely cut and the volume of blood lost during 2 min was recorded with and without electrical stimulation
(n = 5 for each group). Fig. 5 shows the bleeding rate (ml/min)
averaged over the two-minute collection time. Bleeding rate
during 100-V and 20-V stimulation at 10 Hz with 1-ms pulses is
compared to a control (no stimulation). The 20 V stimulation reduced the bleeding rate by more than 3.5 fold from 1.04 ± 0.12
to 0.29 ± 0.08 ml/min (p = 0.0075). The 100-V stimulation reduced the bleeding rate by 9 fold—down to 0.11 ± 0.04 ml/min
(p < 0.001).

To use a hemorrhage control device in the field, the apparatus should be small enough to fit into a first aid kit and should
allow several hours of battery-powered operation. As a proof
of concept of such miniaturization, we designed and fabricated
the 11-mm × 23-mm device shown in Fig. 6. The stimulator
includes a programmable microcontroller (PIC10 F 202, Microchip), powered with the 3-V supply, which serves as a pulse
generator with adjustable duration and repetition rate. The pulse
generator employed a NMOS push–pull output stage to deliver
the supply voltage (∼20 V) to the 1.6-mm diameter stainless
steel disc electrode. Eight, 3-V Lithium Batteries (CR927, Evergreen), stacked together (9.5-mm diameter, 21.6-mm in length),
supplied sufficient voltage to generate pulses of 20.7 V. We
elected to stimulate with asymmetric charge-balanced pulses
to reduce the device size-monophasic pulses requires only one
+20 V power supply. As long as the vessel is equidistant from
the two electrodes the vasoconstriction effect will be similar to
a biphasic pulse and invariant to electrode polarity. To ensure
charge balance, the output was coupled to electrodes via 10μF coupling capacitor. The recharge time constant was more
than 13 ms. The rise and fall times (10%–90%) of the voltage
waveform were 7 and 62 μs, respectively. An example of a 1-ms
pulse generated on a tissue load at 10-Hz repetition rate is shown
in Fig. 6(c). The 10-μF coupling capacitor charged to approximately 2.5 V during the pulse, evidenced by the voltage drop
from 20.7 to 18.2 V. The falling edge of the pulse is composed
of two phases: when the first transistor (push) of the output cascade is turned off, the current drops to zero, and when the second
transistor (pull) opens, the current becomes negative, recharging the coupling capacitor. During the idle phase, the device

operated with 0.45 mA, while during the pulse, the maximum
current draw was 15 mA. To stabilize the supply voltage and
effectively draw current from the battery, a 44-μF capacitor was
connected parallel to the battery pack, which drew an average
current of 0.6 mA from the batteries. With a battery capacity of
30 mAh, even 10% use of its storage capacity should suffice for
5 h of operation.
Effectiveness of the mini-stimulator was also tested on
femoral vessels for 10 min (see Fig. 7). The normalized artery
diameter constricted to 34 ± 1%, similar to the same treatment
obtained with the bench-top stimulator (see Figs. 1 and 2).
IV. DISCUSSION
The 20-V, 10-Hz, 1-ms stimulation applied via a bipolar pair
of 1.6-mm electrodes resulted in rapid (within seconds) constriction of the rat femoral artery to 31 ± 2% of its diameter,
which was maintained throughout a 2-h period, albeit with slow
relaxation to 44 ± 4% by the end of the treatment. Surprisingly,
the bleeding rate decreased only by 3.5 fold at these setting,
compared to control. One could expect the flow rate decrease
at least as a square of the vessel diameter. However, the control
vessel also constricts in response to dissection and bleeding.
In addition, the reduced blood pressure and extra-luminal clotting [22]–[24], both intrinsic hemostatic response mechanisms,
may further reduce the bleeding rate in the control group. Therefore, the advantage of electronic vasoconstriction over no treatment is likely affected by the extent of natural hemostatic ability
of the ruptured vessel. An alternative mechanism of the reduction in blood loss was suggested to be caused by blood clotting
due to endothelial cells electroporation [15], [25]. However, it
is unlikely to play a role in the current study, given the lack of
the endothelial cell damage upon histological examination.
The mechanism of vasoconstriction in response to electrical
stimulation involves activation of sympathetic nerve fibers embedded in the vessel wall and the release of noradrenaline, which
binds to the α1 -adrenoreceptor [26]–[30]. Stimulation of the rat
mesenteric artery with 5-ms pulses of 15–30 V at 10–50 Hz,

1769

applied via bipolar electrodes, was shown to induce vasoconstriction solely by engaging the sympathetic fibers [28]. Similar
to our results, they noted rapid dilation within a few seconds of
the treatment termination and slight relaxation of the constricted
vessel after 30 min of sustained stimulation. Importantly, rapid
dilation of the vessel restores the blood flow once a patient is
stabilized, which should help prevent unnecessary ischemia and
associated tissue damage during definitive surgery. Possible direct engagement of the smooth muscle cells of the vessels’ walls
at higher voltage stimulation requires further investigation.
Despite a significant vasoconstriction of the arteries in response to 20-V, 1-ms waveforms, the veins responded weaker at
these settings and would likely require stronger stimuli. Previous studies indicate that strong vein constriction occurs at higher
voltage (60 V with 1 ms) [16], [31] or longer pulse durations
(20 V with 10 ms in the current study). At low voltage, veins
exhibit short constriction and slow dilatory response, observed
in our study and in previous experiments with rabbit portal vein
(15-V, 1-ms pulses at 10 Hz) [32]. Vein relaxation has been
linked to the release of nonadrenergic noncholinergic neurotransmitters, such as nitric oxide and ATP [32], [33]. Despite
weak venous response, constricted arteries will minimize blood
loss through damaged veins indirectly. If needed, higher voltage
or longer pulse durations can be used to achieve significant vein
constriction [16].
Importantly, electrical stimulation provided sustained arterial
constriction for two hours with no apparent damage to vessel
walls or endothelium, thus leaving the tissues well-preserved
for the following surgery and therapy.
Severe loss of blood, defined as more than 40% of total
blood volume, corresponding to the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) shock class IV, is associated with mean mortality
of 26%. A three-fold lower volume, i.e., loss of less than 15%
(ATLS class I shock), is associated with less than 4% mortality [34]. Though it might be difficult to directly extrapolate the
significance of our results to clinical setting, a 3.5 fold decrease
in bleeding volume might save many lives.
Stimulation parameters for effective control of bleeding in
trauma care will require further investigation in larger animal
models and, eventually, in human patients. Practical application
of electrical stimulation in large wounds with poor visibility of
the vessels will likely require an array of penetrating electrodes
integrated with microsensors. Detection of the temperature, conductivity, and hemoglobin oxygenation ratio will help localize
the source of bleeding and activate the electrodes proximal to
that location. Alternatively, implantable microstimulators could
be injected into the bleeding tissue and powered wirelessly to
induce local vasoconstriction [35]. Since wireless power transmission is rather inefficient, the transmitter will likely be bulky
and require a large power supply. In addition, lack of visibility inside the wound will still require multiple electrodes and
sensors to activate the ones proximal to the bleeding site.
V. CONCLUSION
Pulsed electrical stimulation of the vasculature by a miniature battery-operated generator can constrict the femoral artery

in rats within seconds, sustain constriction for multiple hours,
and then release the vessel within a minute after termination
of the stimulation. Extent of constriction can be controlled by
pulse amplitude, duration and repetition rate. The blood loss
from injured femoral arteries in rats can be reduced by more
than three-fold with 20-V pulses, and more than nine times
with pulses of 100 V. Further experiments in larger animals are
required to optimize the stimulation protocol and evaluate the
potential of this technology for human use.

Daniel Palanker received the Ph.D. degree in applied
physics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, Israel, in 1994.
He is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Ophthalmology and in the Hansen Experimental Physics Laboratory at Stanford University,
Stanford, CA, USA. His research interests include
interactions of electric field with biological cells and
tissues in a broad range of frequencies: from quasistatic to optical, and develops their diagnostic, therapeutic, and prosthetic applications, primarily in ophthalmology. Several of his developments are in clinical practice world-wide:
Pulsed Electron Avalanche Knife (PEAK PlasmaBladeT M ), Patterned Scanning Laser Photocoagulator (PASCALT M ), and OCT-guided Laser System for
Cataract Surgery (CatalysT M ). In addition to laser-tissue interactions, retinal
phototherapy, and associated neural plasticity, he is working on electro-neural
interfaces, including retinal prosthesis, and electronic control of vasculature and
of the glands.
