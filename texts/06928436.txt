Abstract—The heart characteristic length, the inverse of conduction velocity (CV), and the inverse of the refractory period are
known to determine vulnerability to cardiac fibrillation (fibrillation number, FibN) in in silico or ex vivo models. The purpose of
this study was to validate the accuracy of FibN through in silico
atrial modeling and to evaluate its clinical application in patients
with atrial fibrillation (AF) who had undergone radiofrequency
catheter ablation. We compared the maintenance duration of AF
at various FibNA F values using in silico bidomain atrial modeling. Among 60 patients (72% male, 54 ± 13 years old, 82% with
paroxysmal AF) who underwent circumferential pulmonary vein
isolation (CPVI) for AF rhythm control, we examined the relationship between FibNA F and postprocedural AF inducibility or
induction pacing cycle length (iPCL). Clinical FibNA F was calculated using left atrium (LA) dimension (echocardiogram), the
inverse of CV, and the inverse of the atrial effective refractory
periods measured at proximal and distal coronary sinus. In silico
simulation found a positive correlation between AF maintenance
duration and FibNA F (R = 0.90, p < 0.001). After clinical
CPVI, FibNA F (0.296 ± 0.038 versus 0.192 ± 0.028, p <
0.001) was significantly higher in patients with postprocedural AF inducibility (n = 41) than in those without (n = 19).
Among 41 patients with postprocedural AF inducibility, FibNA F
(P = 0.935, p < 0.001) had excellent correlations with induction pacing cycle length. FibNA F , based on LA mass and wavelength, correlates well with AF maintenance in computational modeling and clinical AF inducibility after CPVI.

I. INTRODUCTION
TRIAL fibrillation (AF), one of the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice, is related to increasingly
high rates of disability and mortality [1]. It is predicted that
the number of individuals with AF would more than double
by the year 2050 [2]. The prevalence of AF increases with age
up to 9% among those 80 years or older [3]. As radiofrequency
catheter ablation (RFCA) for AF has become a common practice
for AF rhythm control, the pathophysiology of this multifactorial disease is gradually being uncovered through clinical studies. However, the mechanisms of cardiac fibrillation are still
poorly understood [4]. While the focal source hypothesis [5]
states that a relatively stable periodic source (“mother rotor”)
with fibrillatory conduction maintains fibrillation, the multiple
wavelet hypothesis [6] states that a continuous wavebreak and
localized reentry may sustain fibrillation after the exclusion of
arrhythmogenic triggers [7]–[9]. Probability of reentry is expressed by wavelength, proportional to the effective refractory
period (ERP) and conduction velocity (CV). The cardiac chamber mass also has been found to play an important role in the
maintenance of continuous wavebreak, which led to the critical
mass hypothesis [10], [11]. Moe et al. [12] originally reported
that the characteristic length of substrate, the inverse of CV, and
the inverse of the refractory period determine vulnerability to
fibrillation (fibrillation number, FibN) based on in silico study
of AF. These results are similar in concept to the Reynolds number, which is related to turbulence in fluid flow. In this study, we
tested FibN to validate its predictive value for AF maintenance
in silico, as well as its clinical usefulness among patients with
AF. We hypothesized that FibNAF reflects the vulnerability to
AF maintenance in silico, and postprocedural inducibility of AF
after clinical catheter ablation.

II. METHODS
A. Two-Dimensional Fibrillation Modeling
To test the effect of FibN on wave propagation in cardiac
tissue, we simulated the action potential propagation in atrial
tissue using an in silico model. Time-dependent voltage distribution on a two-dimensional (2-D) computational domain
was obtained by solving the bidomain reaction–diffusion equation as described by Ashihara et al. [13]. The electrophysiological model of human atrial action potential developed by

Courtemanche et al. [14] was used to determine ion channel
currents in each cell at each time step. A 600 × 600 element
cell array, with spatial discretization of 0.25 mm and temporal
discretization of 0.05 ms, was used to simulate fibrillation wave
dynamics. Finite element formulation based on the Galerkin
method was used for discretization of the bidomain equations
for electric wave propagation in tissue [15]. We chose diffusion coefficients of 0.091 mm2 /s for the intracellular domain
and 0.064 mm2 /s for the extracellular domain, which are in
the range of typically used values for cardiac simulation [16].
The resulting CV was 0.31 m/s. No flux condition was applied
for all the boundaries of intra- and extracellular domains. For
reentry initiation, we used the protocol of Clayton and Holden
[17], which we have previously validated [15]. To induce fibrillation, Ito , ICaL , and IKur were reduced by 80%, 30%, and
90%, respectively, and IKr was increased by 50% as described
by Jacquemet et al. [18] The resulting action potential duration
(APD) was 216 ms at 600 ms cycle length, and the maximal
slope of the APD restitution curve is 1.2 [18].

where L is the length scale of tissue size and APD is the action

To evaluate the effect of FibNAF on fibrillation wave dynamics, 2-D fibrillation wave dynamics simulation was performed
for 16 different values of FibNAF determined by randomly generated length scale, APD, and CV. The length of the side of
FibNAF =

the square computational domain was used for the length scale.
The APD was varied by changing the conductance of IKr and
IKs , and CV was decreased by reducing the diffusion coefficients. The range of the length scale was 87.5–150 mm, the
range of refractory period was 216–290 ms, the range of CV was
0.26–0.31 m/s, and the resulting FibNAF values were between
1.21 and 2.22. For each FibNAF value, the time from reentry
initiation to the termination of fibrillation was recorded
C. Clinical Validation of FibNA F in Human AF
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board and adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki. All
patients provided written informed consent. We included consecutive 60 AF patients (71.7% male, 54.2 ± 12.9 years old,
paroxysmal AF: persistent AF = 81.7%:18.3%; Table I) who
underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) guided by
computed tomography (CT) merged three-dimensional (3-D)
NavX map. All patients maintained optimal anticoagulation
status and had ceased all antiarrhythmic medications for five
half-lives of the respective drugs. We examined all patients with
3-D spiral CT (64 Channel, Light Speed Volume CT, Philips,
Brilliance 63, The Netherlands) to visually define the anatomy
of the left atrium (LA). Intracardiac electrograms were recorded
using a Prucka CardioLab Electrophysiology system (General
Electric Health Care System Inc., Milwaukee, WI, USA). We
generated 3-D spiral CT merged 3-D electroanatomic mapping
(NavX system, St. Jude Medical Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA)
for RFCA. An open-irrigated 3.5-mm-tip deflectable catheter
(Celsius, Johnson & Johnson Inc., Diamond Bar, CA, USA;
30–35 W; 47 °C) was used for RFCA. All patients underwent
circumferential PV isolation (CPVI) at the LA antrum level. After CPVI, we generated a LA 3-D activation map by obtaining

contact bipolar electrograms from 350 to 500 points of the LA
endocardium during high right atrial (RA) pacing (cycle length
500 ms). The bipolar electrograms were filtered from 32 to
300 Hz. After acquiring the LA activation map, we measured
atrial effective refractory periods (AERPs) at proximal and coronary sinus by S1–S2 pacing (S1 500 ms). AF inducibility test
was performed with 10-s high current burst pacing (10 mA,
pulse width 5 ms, Bloom Associates, Denver, CO, USA) from
the high RA with starting pacing cycle length (PCL) of 250 ms.
If AF could not be induced or maintained for > 3 min, the PCL
was reduced serially to 200, 190, 180, 170, 160, and 150 ms
with 1:1 atrial capture. Inducibility was defined as the presence
of induced AF lasting for longer than 3 min, and the PCL of
successful induction of AF was regarded as the induction PCL
(iPCL; see Fig. 3).

For off-line analyses, color-coded activation maps were generated by recording bipolar electrograms and the activation time
of negative (dV/dt)m ax . We analyzed the color-coded LA activation maps (see Fig. 3) as previously described [19]. The earliest
activation site on the LA high septum was colored white, and
the site of activation 80 ms later than the earliest activation was
colored purple. The reference distance was measured using the
interelectrode distances of coronary sinus catheters (duodecapolar catheter, St. Jude Medical Inc., Minnetonka, MN, USA.).
Because of limited spatial resolution of LA activation map,
we calculated CV by measuring the distances from the earliest
activation site to the latest activation sites on LA appendage
parallel to septoatrial bundle (AP view) and to LA posterior
wall parallel to septoatrial bundle (PA view), based on histological isotrophy [20] using customized software (Image Pro)
referenced to a color scale bar. The measured distance on the
activation map was divided by the time difference, as measured
using color codes, to calculate the local CV. The length scale of
tissue size was represented by anterior–posterior diameter of LA
measured using 2-D echocardiogram or LA volume measured
using 3-D CT. We did not include RA in our electroanatomic
mapping study, because AF drivers have been known to exist
mostly in LA in experimental model and in human [21], [22].
We calculated FibNAF as follows and compared it with postRFCA inducibility and iPCL. Mean values of AERPs measured
at proximal and distal coronary sinus were used for FibNAF
calculation:

D. Data Analyses
We compared the inducibility of reentry and the incidence
of wavebreak, using the S1–S2 protocol in our 2-D cardiac
simulation model with estimated FibNAF . FibNAF was compared with post-RFCA inducibility of AF, as well as their iPCL.
Comparisons of FibNAF and iPCL were analyzed using the
Mann–Whitney test or the paired t-test. All values were expressed as mean±SD. All statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS version 12.0, and a p-value of <0.05 was considered
significant.

III. RESULTS
A. FibNA F Is Correlated With AF Maintenance Time
in Computer Simulation
The 2-D simulation of AF wave dynamics was performed
for 16 different values of FibNAF , in order to validate FibNAF
as an arrhythmogenecity parameter. Under the default condition of our 2-D bidomain atrial tissue modeling, the length
scale was set to 150 mm, APD was 290 ms, and CV was
0.31 m/s at a pacing cycle length of 600 ms. We generated

eight combinations of length scale, APD, and CV by decreasing
APD, and/or CV, and/or length scale by 26%, 19%, and 42%,
respectively, with a resulting range of FibNAF values between
1.21 and 2.22. Depending on the wave properties, fibrillation
terminated at a point in time with its maintenance time being
longer for higher FibNAF (see Fig. 1). FibNAF and the duration of fibrillation maintenance exhibited a significant positive
correlation (see Fig. 2, R = 0.90, p < 0.001).
B. FibNA F Has Linear Correlation With Postprocedure iPCL
After AF Ablation
We compared FibNAF and inducibility of AF after RFCA
in 60 patients (see Table I). Compared to patients with negative postprocedural inducibility of AF (n = 19), the positive
inducibility group showed lower E/Em in echocardiography
(p = 0.004), slower CV (p < 0.001), and higher FibNAF (p <
0.001). Fig. 3 shows representative examples, which emphasize the clinical significance of FibNAF . In general, AF is more
easily inducible in patients who have larger LA than those with
smaller LA. However, AF was more difficult to induce in the patient with low FibNAF and enlarged LA [see Fig. 3(a)] than the

patient with high FibNAF and normal sized LA [see Fig. 3(b)]
in these specific examples. The main determinant for this difference in FibNAF was CV. Fig. 1(b) shows an in silico example
of shorter AF maintenance duration with larger tissue size and
lower FibNAF . In terms of iPCL of post-CPVI inducibility,
FibNAF was significantly higher in patients with AF induction
at iPCL ࣙ 200 ms (n = 12, 0.315 ± 0.024) than that in patients
with iPCL 150–190 ms (n = 29, 0.283 ± 0.036, p < 0.0001) or
noninducible patients [n = 19, 0.192 ± 0.028, p < 0.000; see
Fig. 4(a)]. Postablation iPCL for AF had linear correlations with
FibNAF [R = 0.94, p < 0.0001; see Fig. 4(b)].
IV. DISCUSSION
A. Main Findings
As proposed by Moe et al. [12], FibNAF is a nondimensional
number characterizing susceptibility to fibrillation in cardiac
electrophysiology. A higher FibN implies a greater vulnerability
to fibrillation. In this study, we performed in silico simulation,
and found that FibNAF had a linear correlation with fibrillation
maintenance time. We also applied FibNAF to the clinical data
of patients who had undergone catheter ablation of AF. FibNAF
of patients with positive postprocedural AF inducibility was
significantly higher than that of the patients without inducibility,
and FibNAF had a linear correlation with the PCL required to
induce fibrillation.
B. Electrophysiological Meaning of FibNA F
FibN can be interpreted as the ratio of the propagating inertia
of an electric wave relative to the diffusive dissipation in physiological terms [23]. As the propagating inertia increases relative
to dissipation, the instability of the electric wave increases, resulting in an increased risk of reentry wave generation. FibNAF
is related to the parameter derived from the cardiac wave propagation equation expressed with the reference frequency and
diffusion coefficient [23]. The reference frequency and diffusion coefficient are related to APD and CV, respectively. Since
cardiac wavelength is equal to APD times CV, FibN is essentially heart (tissue) size relative to cardiac wavelength. Our
observation that higher values of FibNAF are correlated with

677

increased arrhythmogenecity is consistent with several other
studies, which found that larger heart is more arrhythmogenic
[24]–[27]. Garrey [28] had reported that the persistence of fibrillation is proportional to the size of the tissue. Qu [29] confirmed
the dependence of fibrillation maintenance on tissue size using
in silico modeling. In addition, it has also been hypothesized
that a minimum amount of tissue is required for fibrillation
maintenance, which is known as the “critical mass hypothesis.”
Kim et al. [10] reported that the nature of cardiac wave dynamics transitioned from chaotic to periodic below a critical mass
in the right ventricular tissue of swine. Hwang et al. [30] documented the existence of critical mass in human atrium by testing
atrial defibrillation threshold and iPCL. While the critical mass
hypothesis initially proposed by Garrey [28] relates tissue mass
to fibrillation, the fibrillation number examined in this study
incorporates the effects of more parameters such as refractory
period and CV as well as tissue mass. Wavelength is another
parameter that affects fibrillation maintenance. It is widely accepted that wavelength relative to tissue size determines wave
dynamics characteristics [29], [31].
C. Predictors of AF
Risk factors for AF include hypertension, diabetes, male gender, vascular disease, obesity, and sleep apnea [32]. There have
been numerous studies regarding predictors of AF or AF recurrence after catheter ablation. LA size [33], function [34],
pressure [35], and heart rate variability [36] are among the predictors, as well as the duration of refractory period and CV,
which have already been discussed. However, FibNAF is a combination of three factors, each of which has been found to be
associated with increased susceptibility to AF. In the present
study, LA diameter, LA volume, and AERPs were not significantly different between the patients with inducibility and those
without. In contrast, CV was significantly lower in positive inducibility group, which had higher FibNAF . We measured CV at
a fixed site with a fixed PCL, because CV is dependent on heart
rate and pacing site. However, it was reported that the rate related conduction slowing is more predictive of AF than baseline
CV [37], and the CV restitution property [38] is more prominent under the condition with slower CV. Although we obtained
the duration of refractory period and CV with invasive methods
in this study, these values might be obtained with noninvasive
methods such as P-wave duration in electrocardiography [39],
[40]. Development of parameters that can be calculated using
data from noninvasive methods is the next step of this study.
D. Clinical Implication
Parameters that quantify atrial arrhythmogenecity would
complement existing diagnostic criteria, and assist clinicians
in choosing optimal management strategy. Because no quantitative clinical measure of arrhythmias due to reentry waves has
been proposed, the clinical effectiveness of FibNAF is noteworthy. In this regard, FibNAF can represent the personalized AF
burden and supplement the limitation of current crude classification of AF: paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent AF [41].
Second, low burden paroxysmal AF appears transiently and is

678

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2015

hardly identified in electrocardiogram. Therefore, FibNAF can
be used as a biomarker index for AF with reentry mechanism.
FibNAF can also be utilized for early detection of risky population for AF and stroke as part of the medical examinations
of both healthy patients as well as those suffering from related
diseases. Third, FibNAF could also be used to assess the success
of arrhythmia management by comparing pre- and posttreatment
values. Although appropriate substrate modification is required
to achieve anti-arrhythmic effect during catheter ablation for AF,
excessively long ablation time is independently associated with
high recurrence rate of AF, especially in patients with persistent
AF [42].
E. Study Limitations
In fibrillation wave dynamics, there are a number of important parameters that can be used to characterize wave dynamics
aside from the duration of fibrillation. These parameters include wavebreak, phase singularity, dominant frequency, complex fractionated electrogram, and rotor [43]–[45]. Examining
these parameters for different values of FibNAF is the next step
of this study. Although FibN is a combination of three factors, namely, CV, AERP, and heart size, CV mainly affected the
difference in FibNAF between the inducible and non-inducible
groups. It may be due to selection bias or small number of
patients. We generally do not conduct AF ablation in patients
who have very large LA (>55 mm). Although we demonstrated
clinical usefulness of FibN in this study, further studies are
warranted with larger number of patients with more diverse
conditions in the future. We used the values of in silico CV
lower than those of clinically observed ones to induce AF lasting up to 20 s in 2-D model. We did not calculate conduction
distance perpendicular to the isochronal map for CV measurement in LA activation map, due to limited spatial resolution of
LA activation map. Instead, we measured the distances from
the earliest activation site to the latest activation sites on LA
appendage parallel to septoatrial bundle and to LA posterior
wall parallel to septoatrial bundle, based on histological isotrophy [20]. FibNAF represents the inducibility of AF based on
reentrant mechanisms, and AF with non-reentrant mechanisms
cannot be quantified by this number. The ultimate goal of this
study is to apply FibNAF to individual patients in a clinical
setting. Although we observed a positive correlation between
the duration of fibrillation and FibNAF , individual patients may
exhibit different wave dynamics characteristics. Additional clinical and computational research is needed to ensure that FibNAF
is applicable to individual patients.
V. CONCLUSION
The FibNAF , based on critical mass and wavelength, correlates well with AF maintenance in computational modeling and
clinical AF inducibility after CPVI.
