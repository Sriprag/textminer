Temporal and Spatial Monitoring and Prediction
of Epidemic Outbreaks
Amin Zamiri, Hadi Sadoghi Yazdi, and Sepideh Afkhami Goli

Abstract—This paper introduces a nonlinear dynamic model to
study spatial and temporal dynamics of epidemics of susceptibleinfected-removed type. It involves modeling the respective collections of epidemic states and syndromic observations as random
finite sets. Each epidemic state consists of the number of infected
individuals in an isolated population system and the corresponding partially known parameters of the epidemic model. The infectious disease could spread between population systems with known
probabilities based on prior knowledge of ecological and biological
features of the environment. The problem is then formulated in the
context of Bayesian framework and estimated via a probability hypothesis density filter. Each population system under surveillance
is assumed to be homogenous and fixed, with daily reports on the
number of infected people available for monitoring and prediction.
When model parameters are partially known, results of numerical
studies indicate that the proposed approach can help early prediction of the epidemic in terms of peak and duration.
Index Terms—Filtering, nonlinear dynamic systems, spatiotemporal phenomena, syndromic surveillance.

I. INTRODUCTION
N epidemic is a term used in epidemiology that refers
to “the appearance of new cases of a particular disease
in a given human population, during a given time period, at a
rate that substantially exceeds the expected number based on
recent experience” [1]. The effects of an epidemic can quickly
spread from a region to a country, or even a group of countries
[2] ranging from a local cluster of a communicable disease
to a global threat, as in the case of the ongoing epidemics of
AIDS, tuberculosis, and the recent outbreaks of avian influenza
(H5N1), SARS, and H1N1 (swine flu) [3], [4].
In surveillance terms, “syndromic” or “prediagnosis” relates
to a specific set of symptoms not requiring laboratory confirmation for diagnosis. While syndromic observations are available
much earlier than that of postdiagnosis reports, they are not deterministic and suffer from noisy and incomplete data [5]–[7].
The goal of syndromic surveillance is estimating and predicting
any increase in the rate of reported cases, allowing a timelier
public health response [8], [9].

Syndromic surveillance algorithms and its applications have
recently attracted significant attention by scientific community
and the governments [8] and there is a plethora of literature
devoted to this topic (more comprehensive reviews are provided
in [10]–[12] and references therein).
Generally, the problem is often formulated as prospective
evaluation of a single-time series. Unfortunately there is not an
extensive body of the literature focusing on analysis of multiple data sources with spatial information [13]. A straightforward approach to incorporate spatial information is to apply
a separate single-time series approach within each spatial region. In practice, however, the different time series under study
may be influenced by common confounding factors, and so
they are likely to be correlated [14]. For example, an infectious
agent in one region could spread to neighboring areas through
various forms of transition pathways, with similar peak and
duration [15].
In this paper, a recursive information fusion algorithm is presented for the prediction of epidemic progress amongst a set
of isolated population systems. These population systems could
represent a specific geographical area such as a city or a country.
The population dynamics within each area is described independently, with additional terms accounting for the probability of
spread. The problem is then formulated in the Bayesian context
of nonlinear multitarget filtering and estimated using a probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter with particle systems implementation known as particle-PHD or sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) PHD filter in tracking literature. While the Bayesian formulation and the nonlinear filtering implementation have been
considered earlier, see [16]–[18], none has considered the case
of spatial spread of the disease. This paper introduces a novel
multitarget approach to include spatial information of reported
cases while providing temporal estimates of epidemic peak and
duration. We formulate and solve the optimal Bayes predictor
when there are several sources of syndromic data streams (each
from a specific area) and the number of outbreaks is unknown.
The observation data in this case could be noisy and missed in
some short intervals, as typically in the case of syndromic data
[6]. Numerical results are provided in this paper as a proof of
concept using syndromic data based on a real-world epidemic
in Switzerland.
The celebrated susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model
[19]–[21] is a suitable epidemiological model for our framework. The epidemic curve in the SIR model is formulated by
only two parameters of the population: contact rate β and recovery time γ. With values of these parameters at hand, the number
of infected people could be predicted at each time step based on
the current population of infected and susceptible.

Our choice of the SIR model was driven by its widespread
adaptation and relevance for the operational context of the
problem, which is the short-term prediction for an emerging
epidemic that is spreading rapidly. Although the attractive simplicity of the SIR model is a plus, there are some shortcomings
involved. A clear downside of this model is the inability to
describe any spatial aspects of infectious disease spread [22],
which is addressed in the proposed approach.
II. MOTIVATION
The analysis of infection spread through linked populations
systems is of great significance [23] and attracts considerable
attention; the Foot and Mouth Disease epidemic of 2001 being an important example [24]. An excellent review of the literature on spatial epidemic models can be found in [5] and
[25].
Incorporating spatial information into the epidemic model
is motivated by two factors. These factors could contribute to
earlier and more accurate modeling during the initial stages of
epidemic, and are discussed in this section.
In order to benefit from spatial information, reported data
from all geographical areas of interest should be modeled in a
holistic approach. This is where single time-series approaches,
including single-target filtering, fall short. Spatial information
in these methods, if considered at all, is usually handled by
running a separate algorithm for each region. Consequently, the
spatial autocorrelation is neglected [5].
A. Spatial Patterns of Spread
Spatial patterns and disease spread directions could be observed during the course of an epidemic. In European continent,
for example, a west–east direction of influenza spread was observable for several years [26]. The 2003/2004 influenza season
in Switzerland is a clear instance of such pattern. The first wave
of the epidemic appears in the final weeks of 2003 in Geneva,
Switzerland, and then, spreads to nearby cities in the following
weeks [15].
Ecological and geographical features could also shape certain
patterns of spatial spread. In fox rabies, for example, rivers
act as barriers that holds back further spread of the disease
[27].
Once an outbreak is detected, prior knowledge on patterns
and directions of spread could contribute to earlier predictions
for clean areas, based on their risk of contamination.
B. Behavioral Similarity of Epidemics
Because of the spatial variability of the population (contact
rate and recovery time), it is hypothesized that the epidemic
curves could vary from place to place and even wave to wave
[28]. Therefore, an epidemic in one population system could
evolve differently after spreading to another. However, the variability of this kinetic process for the same strain could be usually
modeled by a limited range of parameter values [29]. Pandemic
influenza cases, for example, are suggested to be latent for two
days and infectious for 2.5 days [30].

III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Modeling Population Dynamics
According to the SIR model, the population of a system can
be subdivided into three interacting groups: susceptible, infectious, and removed individuals [21], [31]. Let the number of
susceptible, infectious, and removed denoted by SL , IL , and
RL , respectively, so that SL + IL + RL = PL , where PL is the
total size of the population system L. To represent an epidemic
progress in time as a dynamic model, the following differential
equations based on the “conservation” law for the population
are derived:
dsL
= −qL
dt
diL
= qL − γL iL
dt
rL = 1 − sL − iL

(1)
(2)
(3)

where
1) sL = SL /PL , iL = IL /PL , and rL = RL /PL are the
normalized compartment sizes;
2) γL represents the average infectious period of the disease;
3) the term qL (iL , sL ) describes the social interactions between the individuals of population. As in the classical
SIR model, we assume qL (iL , sL ) = βL iL sL . The contact rate parameter βL is a product βL = ρL . γL , with
ρL being the basic reproductive number, which represents
the average number of new infections produced by direct
contact with a single infected individual that would be
expected in a population of entirely susceptible subjects.
The epidemic model parameters can be assumed to be partially known
as interval values, that is
 for every population

βL ∈ β̄, β and γL ∈ γ̄, γ for each population system of area
L under study.
B. Measurement Model
For each area L (with an ongoing epidemic) at a specific time
step t, we assume
zL = iL + ωL

(4)

where zL is the observable proportion (reported cases at time t)
of infected population in area L. The noise term ωL is added to
simulate the randomness of real-world syndromic observations
(measurements noise), which is assumed to be uncorrelated to
other population systems.
The collection of all measurement for all population systems
(observable proportion of infected population) at time t is denoted by
Δ

Zt = {zi t , i = 1, . . . , Nt }

(5)

where Nt is the total number of measurements reported at time
t. The aforementioned model allows for reports on the number
of cases to be missed and to include noisy or false reports.
The problem is then to estimate the “true” number of infected
areas and normalized number of infected iL and susceptible sL

ZAMIRI et al.: TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL MONITORING AND PREDICTION OF EPIDEMIC OUTBREAKS

at time t, together with model parameters, for each area using
observations zL of (4), collected at time t.
C. Handling Spatial Information
Modeling spatial population dynamics in humans or animals
requires comprehensive ecological and biological knowledge of
the pathogenesis of the infectious agent. Accurate reporting of
the variables involved (including mobility range, dispersal rates,
contact rates, etc.) is paramount for realistic construction of a
spatial model [4], [32]. In practice, however, such information
is not readily available and can be very expensive to obtain
[33]. Moreover, available data primarily reflect politically defined reporting units rather than biologically relevant ecological
units [27].
To avoid complications that arise from comprehensive modeling of population dynamics, our model is reduced to the basic
assumption of infectious disease spread based on predefined
probabilities between each pair of population systems.
IV. PROPOSED APPROACH
A. Optimal Bayesian Solution
The model (1)–(3) are given in continuous time. For a recursive algorithm, a discrete-time approximation of this model is
required. The state vector for each target area is adopted as
x = [s i β γ L]T

(6)

where T denotes the matrix transpose. It includes i and s for
every infected area and also the imprecisely known parameters
β and γ as well as the area identifier L.
The state is assumed to follow a Markov process on state space
X ⊆ Rn x . Let Mk be the number of ongoing epidemics detected
at k, where k = tk /τ is the discrete time index for small integration interval τ > 0. Suppose that, at time k − 1, the targets
are xk −1,1 , . . . , xk −1,M k ∈ X . At the next time step, a subset of
these targets may not exist (finished epidemics), the surviving
targets evolve to their new states, and some new targets may appear (due to disease spread to new areas or spontaneous epidemic
emergence). This results in new states xk ,1 , . . . , xk ,M k ∈ X .
The state vector in from of (6) includes all the required information for each target (i.e., an ongoing epidemic of SIR type
for an isolated population system). Following the discussions
provided in Section II, the spread of disease from one area to
another, as well as the possibility of new epidemic emergence
in areas under study, should also be modeled. The problem is
that the state evolution model for each area cannot be processed
independently. Moreover, the number of infected areas in this
case is unknown and false alarms in the number of reported
cases (clutter) are possible.
The random finite set (RFS) [34] approach to multitarget
tracking is an emerging and promising approach to address these
limitations [35], [36]. In the RFS formulation, the collection
of individual targets is treated as a set-valued state, and the
collection of individual observations is treated as a set-valued
observation, i.e.
Xk = {xk ,1 , . . . , xk ,M k } ∈ F(X )

(7)

737

Zk = {zk ,1 , . . . , zk ,N k } ∈ F(Z)

(8)

where F(X ) and F(Z) are the respective collections of all finite
subsets of X and Z.
Set-valued states and set-valued observations modeling approach allows the problem of dynamically estimating multiple
targets in the presence of noisy and incomplete data [34]–[37].
The problem of spatial monitoring of epidemics is then formulated as multitarget tracking and is posed as a filtering problem
with multitarget state space F(X ) and observation space F(Z).
The RFS that models the multitarget state, is the union of
state vectors that survived from previous time step, those which
have been spawned by existing targets and those which appear
spontaneously, and is given by
⎛
⎞ ⎛
⎞


Sk |k −1 (x)⎠ ∪ ⎝
Bk |k −1 (x)⎠ ∪ Γk .
Xk = ⎝
x∈X k −1

x∈X k −1

(9)
In the aforementioned formulation, the first term is the RFS
of epidemic states at discrete time index k given the previous
states Xk −1 (survived targets). Sk |k −1 (x) can take on either
{xk } when the epidemic continues, or ∅ when the epidemic
period is passed. The second term represents the RFS of newly
infected areas spawned from the previous epidemics at time
step k − 1. The last term, RFS Γk , accounts for spontaneous
epidemic emergence in clean areas.
The multitarget measurement at time step k is modeled by
the RFS
	



Zk = Kk ∪
Θk (x)
(10)
x∈X k

where Θk (x) is the RFS of measurements from multitarget state
Xk , and Kk is the RFS of measurements due to false reports
(clutter). For a given target xk , the term Θk (xk ) can take on
either {zk } when the target is detected (there is a report available
for kth day) with probability pD ,k (xk ), or ∅ when the target is
missed with probability 1 − pD ,k (xk ).
The formal Bayesian solution is given in the form of the
multitarget posterior density p(Xk |Z1:k ). Based on the posterior
density, our aim is to predict the progress of the epidemic across
areas under study at the next time step k + 1, using the dynamic
model equations.
The multitarget Bayes filter propagates the multitarget posterior density pk (·|Zk ) conditioned on the sets of observations up
to time k, Zk , with the following recursions.
Step 1–Prediction:

pk |k −1 (Xk |Zk −1 ) = fk |k −1 (Xk |X)pk −1 (X|Zk )μs (dx).

Step 2–Update:
pk (Xk |Zk ) =

(12)

where the dynamic model is governed by the multitarget
transition density fk |k −1 (Xk |X) and multitarget likelihood
gk (Zk |Xk ) and μs is an appropriate reference measure on

738

F(X ) [38]. The randomness in the multitarget evolution and
observation described by (9) and (10) are, respectively, captured
in fk |k −1 (·|·) and gk (.|.) [39].
The function gk (Zk |Xk ) is the joint multitarget likelihood
function of observing the set of measurements, Z, given the set
of target states X. The parameters for this density are the set
of observations Z, the unknown set of targets X, observation
noise, probability of detection PD , false alarm PFA , and clutter
models [40].
The evolution of the epidemic state, by neglecting the process
noise for the moment, can be written according to (1) and (2) as
ẋ = g(x) where
g(x) = [−βis (βs − γ)i 0 0 0]T .

(13)

For a small integration interval τ > 0, one could approximate
the state evolution in time using the Euler method:
x(t + τ ) ≈ x(t) + τ g(x (t)).

(14)

B. Estimation With Particle-PHD Filter
The recursion (11) and (12) involves multiple integrals on the
space F(X ), which are computationally intractable [39]. Therefore, the multitarget Bayes filter is computationally intractable.
The PHD filter [41] is an approximation that propagates the
first-order statistical moment, or PHD, of the RFS of states in
time [35]. Since the PHD filter operates on the single-target state
space, it avoids the combinatorial problem that arises from data
association. These outstanding features of the PHD filter are
extremely attractive for practical problems [39]. In our study,
the problem of data association is resolved by including the area
identifier (L) in the state vector, because the origin of reported
cases of infection is always available.
For a RFS X on X with probability distribution P, its firstorder moment is nonnegative function v on X , called the intensity or PHD [35] in tracking literature, such that for each region

In this notation, xk [i] represents the ith component of vector
xk . Process noise w in (14) is assumed to be zero-mean white
Gaussian with a diagonal covariance matrix Q of size 5 × 5.
Its components, except the first two, are set to zero based on
assumption that β and γ are constant during the epidemic.
As mentioned earlier, spatial spread is modeled by a set of
predefined probabilities of transition pathways between areas.
In this setting, βk |k −1 (x), returns an state vector of (6) with area
identifier selected based on the transition probability of area x[5]
to other areas (trans(.)), and is defined by

gives the expected number of elements of X that are in S. The
local maxima of the intensity v are points in X with the highest
density of expected number of targets, and therefore, can be
used to generate estimates for elements of X [39].
Let vk and vk |k −1 denote the respective intensities associated
with the multitarget posterior density pk and the multitarget
predicted density pk |k −1 in the recursion (11) and (12). It can be
shown that the posterior intensity can be propagated in time via
the PHD recursion.

third components. Subroutine trans generates a random number identifying an area under study, such that the area with the
highest transition probability with xk −1 [5] has a higher probability of selection.

Since the PHD recursion involves multiple integrals that have
no closed-form solutions in general, we develop an approximate solution. Generic sequential Monte Carlo techniques have
been proposed to propagate the posterior intensity in time (see
[42] and references therein). In this approach, state estimates
are extracted from the particles representing the posterior intensity using clustering techniques such as k-means or expectation

for this study.
The particle-PHD approximates the intensity of the posterior PDF pk (Xk |Zk ) by a weighted random sample. Given a
sequence of measurement sets Z1:k , the approximation at time
step k > 0 is given as follows.
In the initialization step, particles are distributed across the
state space according to the prior. The initial intensity function

B. Prediction Performance
In the following set of results, prediction errors for the upcoming observations at each cutoff day during the course of the
epidemic are calculated. The results are compared with the SIR
fit over the observations using an exhaustive search. Regression
and model fitting approaches are common in the biosurveillance
literature for comparison and validation [7], [45].
Fig. 1 compares the prediction results of the model and SIR
fit for different cutoff days. This figure serves to demonstrate the
prediction robustness of the proposed algorithm by filtering out
noisy data and incorporating prior knowledge into the model.
Although the predefined intervals for parameters β and γ were
the same, the fitted SIR curve suffers from imprecise predictions and high fluctuations, especially during the early days of
monitoring.

C. Prior Knowledge in Early Prediction
As more observations become available, prior knowledge on
partially known model parameters is increased. The possible
similarity of epidemic waves (see Section II-B) would then help
improve early prediction when a new population is infected.
Fig. 2 displays estimation and prediction results after ten
days of monitoring the epidemic waves for selected cities. It is
observed that the 95% confidence interval area gets tighter in the
second and third wave. A subset of particles for Lausanne and
Bern are generated based on current estimates in Geneva and
Lausanne, respectively, using (15), which improves convergence
for these cities. In the second and third waves, the particles are
more concentrated in the vicinity of SIR fit.
Studying Fig. 2, one can make the observation that in accordance with our expectations, the estimation and prediction
results are more certain when prior knowledge of parameters β
and υ is gathered during the first wave. However, even when
the knowledge of these parameters is imprecise, the reported
cases corresponding to what we consider as the “true” number
of infected people (empty diamonds) are always enveloped by
predictions after a few days of monitoring.

D. Disease Transition Probabilities
Based on the prior knowledge of west–east direction of epidemic spread [26], [15], disease transition probabilities were
selected such that the first wave of influenza epidemic is more
probable to appear in Geneva. The epidemic would spread to
Lausanne with high probability and from there to the next city,
Bern. The following experiment studies the influence of the
predefined disease transition probabilities on the proposed algorithm. In Fig. 3 the “true” observations for the first 40 days of
monitoring, together with state estimate of infected population
are displayed. The horizontal solid line is the event threshold, determining which observations are fed to the filtering
algorithm.
Disease transition probabilities dictate the corresponding
population system in the randomly generated state vectors. In
this case, more state vectors for Geneva are generated.

thin dashed lines are the predicted curves for model and the SIR fit, respectively.

Since the set of the state vectors representing spontaneous
epidemics Γk contains more particles for Geneva, on days 8
and 9 the (manually modified) number of reported cases are not
detected as an ongoing epidemic and are ignored as false alarms
simply because the summation of the corresponding particle

confidence intervals are displayed by solid and dashed lines, respectively. In the histograms, the vertical dashed line is the result of SIR fit over all observations.

weights (Nk ) is not greater than 1, until the third report on day
10. Comparing with the algorithm behavior on day 18, a single
report for Geneva is estimated as an epidemic and is tracked
during the following days.
Once an ongoing epidemic is detected in a city, detection
sensitivity is increased for its neighbors as more particles are
generated, representing target birth through spatial spread with
Bk |k −1 in (16). This is the case of the first report of Lausanne
on day 26 and also the sixth report of Bern on day 36.

E. Spatial Information
In this section, the effects of spatial information in prediction
results are studied. To this end, a comparison of the prediction accuracy and confidence of the proposed algorithm with a
version of the algorithm with no spatial information (zero disease transition probability) and also a similar approach based
on a single target (no spatial information) particle filter [16], is
provided.

results are averaged over ten runs of the algorithm. Parameter values obtained
by fitting a SIR curve to data of the epidemic wave are shown with the horizontal
line.

in city Bern; (a) proposed algorithm, (b) proposed algorithm with no spatial
information provided and (c) single target particle filter implementation with no
spatial information as in [16]. Marks and symbols as in Fig. 2.

With disease transition probabilities defined beforehand, prior
knowledge on SIR model parameters in form of range values
are acquired during the monitoring phase. This improves the
prediction results by providing a set of starting points in the
search space of the problem for the newly infected areas.
As depicted in Fig. 4, the confidence interval is tighter and the
predicted parameters are more concentrated around the “right”
answer in the proposed algorithm as opposed to the other two
methods.
By ignoring disease transition probabilities [see Fig. 4(b)],
the prior knowledge on SIR model parameters is lost. It can be
observed that the confidence margin in this case is larger and
the histogram of predicted parameters display a wide range of
possibilities. This is also true for any similar algorithm without
this kind of prior knowledge as shown in Fig. 4(c).

F. Peak Duration and Intensity Prediction
Prediction performance of epidemic duration and peak intensity is studied in the final set of results (see Fig. 5). For the
epidemic in Bern, d = 56 and im ax = 0.1. At each cutoff day,
intensity is computed using the approximate formulae from Theorem 2.1 in [46] under the assumption that initial susceptible
population s0 ≈ 1 and initial infected population i0 ≈ 0.
im ax ≈ 1 − ρ−1 + ρ−1 log(ρ−1 )

(27)

where ρ = βγ (see Section III-A). Parameters γ and β are estimated from the observations available up to the cutoff day (current estimate of the state vector). The duration of the epidemic is
calculated by measuring the size of an SIR curve simulation using the estimated β and γ. The results further show that duration
and intensity are reasonably acceptable, even in short periods
of observation. The uncertainty in estimation decreases as more
observations become available.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed an algorithm for estimation and
prediction of epidemic outbreaks formulated in the context of
multitarget nonlinear filtering, based on the set of observations
of the number of infected people in loosely coupled population
systems. The epidemic progression in time is modeled using
the classical compartmental SIR model. While an independent
set of SIR parameters is used to model the epidemic dynamics
within each area, the proposed framework is capable of modeling spatial information as well. This is carried out by defining
a set of transition probabilities between each pair of monitored
geographical areas. Prediction and estimation results for newly
infected areas also benefit from early convergence by narrowing the range of possible model parameters based on epidemic
behavior in neighboring areas. The algorithm, implemented as a
particle-PHD filter, provides continuous estimation of the state
of all epidemics, including the infected population and the partially known parameters of the SIR model for every population
system. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
can be useful in providing timely prediction of the epidemic peak
and duration when the uncertainty in prior knowledge of model
parameters is limited.
The proposed method is rather a conceptual solution for a
new biosurveillance and still at its early stages of development.
Further research is concerned with practical problems regarding its operational deployment. For instance, there is a potential
challenge in selecting more complicated epidemic models and
also incorporating population migration patterns (variable population). Our future work would involve a generalization of the
proposed framework to include more realistic criterions with
regards to known ecological and biological features of animal
and human populations.
