Abstract—Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has long been recognized as a powerful tool for cardiovascular imaging because of
its unique potential to measure blood flow, cardiac wall motion,
and tissue properties jointly. However, many clinical applications
of cardiac MRI have been limited by low imaging speed. In this paper, we present a novel method to accelerate cardiovascular MRI
through the integration of parallel imaging, low-rank modeling,
and sparse modeling. This method consists of a novel image model
and specialized data acquisition. Of particular novelty is the proposed low-rank model component, which is specially adapted to
the particular low-rank structure of cardiovascular signals. Simulations and in vivo experiments were performed to evaluate the
method, as well as an analysis of the low-rank structure of a numerical cardiovascular phantom. Cardiac imaging experiments were
carried out on both human and rat subjects without the use of
ECG or respiratory gating and without breath holds. The proposed
method reconstructed 2-D human cardiac images up to 22 fps and
1.0 mm × 1.0 mm spatial resolution and 3-D rat cardiac images
at 67 fps and 0.65 mm × 0.65 mm × 0.31 mm spatial resolution.
These capabilities will enhance the practical utility of cardiovascular MRI.

turing the structural and functional changes of the beating heart
in real time. Over the last five decades, significant progress has
been made, leading to the successful development and application of several noninvasive cardiac imaging modalities, including echocardiography [1], cardiac CT [2], cardiac PET (positron
emission tomography) [3], cardiac SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) [4], and cardiac MRI (magnetic
resonance imaging) [5]. Cardiovascular MRI has a unique potential to allow multiple comprehensive cardiac assessments in a
single integrated examination [6], such as measurement of blood
flow and cardiac wall motion, assessment of tissue properties,
etc. [7], [8]. However, the low imaging speeds of existing MRI
technology have limited its research and clinical impact.
Significant efforts have been made over the last three decades
to develop high-speed MRI technology, resulting in a large
number of methods. These methods can be grouped into three
categories: 1) fast scanning methods using special pulse sequences [9]–[13]; 2) parallel imaging methods using phased
array coils [14]–[17]; and more recently, 3) sparse sampling
methods [18]–[36].
Sparse sampling methods for cardiac MRI can be partitioned
into two subcategories: those exploiting the sparsity of cardiovascular images in various domains [22], [24], [25], [26], [27],
and those exploiting the partial separability (PS)-induced lowrank properties of cardiac images [30]–[33]. Because sparsity
and low-rankness are complementary properties, methods have
been proposed recently which jointly enforce both the PS model
and signal sparsity. Examples include PS-Sparse [34], [35] and
k-t SLR [36].
In this paper, we present a novel method that synergistically
integrates fast scanning, parallel imaging, and both low-rank
and sparse modeling. We have successfully used the technique
to perform 2-D human cardiac imaging up to 22 fps and 1.0 mm
× 1.0 mm spatial resolution and 3-D rat cardiac imaging at 67
fps and 0.65 mm × 0.65 mm × 0.31 mm spatial resolution
without the use of ECG gating, respiratory gating, or breath
holds. This unprecedented 3-D capability enables simultaneous whole-heart imaging of cardiac motion, respiratory motion,
and first-pass myocardial perfusion. This in turn allows multiple cardiac assessments including measurement of ejection
fraction, cardiac output, and myocardial blood flow in a single
experiment. We believe that this capability would improve the
practical impact of cardiovascular MRI.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the proposed method in detail. Section III shows some

representative results obtained using the proposed method, and
Section IV contains the conclusion of the paper.
II. PROPOSED METHOD
The proposed method achieves high-speed cardiac imaging
by using a novel data acquisition scheme that sparsely samples (k, t)-space. The sparse sampling scheme is enabled by
a new image model capable of reconstructing high-quality images from highly undersampled data. This model effectively
integrates: 1) sparse sampling based on “regional” PS (a form
of low-rank modeling); 2) sparse sampling based on compressed
sensing (CS) (a form of sparse modeling); and 3) sparse sampling based on sensitivity encoding using phased array coils
(often known as parallel imaging). In this section, we describe
our proposed method in detail.
A. Spatiotemporal Image Model
We represent the spatiotemporal changes of cardiac images
using an Lth-order PS model [30], [31],
ρ(r, t) =

degree of spatiotemporal correlation makes {d(km , t)}M
m =1 linearly dependent (M > L).
The basic PS model assumes that the entire image shares
a common temporal subspace of same dimension. There are
several ways to extend the basic PS model for cardiac imaging
[37], [38]. For example, noting that cardiac and noncardiac
anatomy undergo different types of motion, the spatiotemporal
signal changes can be more efficiently represented by a regional
PS model as

space for the cardiac region (Ω) and the noncardiac region, respectively. In practice, we may further assume that
2

⊃ span{φ (t)}L=1
since any background mospan{ϕ (t)}L=1
tion (e.g., respiratory motion) also affects the cardiac region.
Therefore, we can rewrite (3) as

express the singular value decomposition (SVD) of its Casorati
matrix C(d) as

where ψ̃ (k) = Fr {ψ (r)}. The Lth-order PS model
implies that the following Casorati matrix

d(kM , tN )

which can be constructed for any arbitrary set of indices
N
{m}M
m =1 and {n}n =1 , has a rank of no more than L [31], [33].
The same is true for the Casorati matrix C(ρ). It has been observed that cardiac (k, t)-space signals are often partially separable to a low order (as illustrated in Fig. 1) because the high

where σ is the th singular value, and where u and v are the
th left and right singular vectors, respectively. Clearly, we have
L = L2 . An experimental “fact” that can be taken advantage of
for constructing the PS model in (4) is that the dominant right
singular vectors tend to capture the “low-frequency” (e.g., respiratory) temporal signal changes, while the “high-frequency”
components represent mainly cardiac signal changes (as illustrated in Fig. 2 below and also in Fig. 4 in Section III-A).
Therefore, one set of temporal basis functions for ρ(r, t) can be
defined in the form ϕ̂ (tn ) = Vn∗  (note that the th column of
V is equal to v ), which is already partitioned according to the
assumptions in (4).
B. Data Acquisition
The (k, t)-space signal from a parallel array of Q coils can
be expressed as

measured at a limited number of k-space locations. The figure plots the real
parts of v 2 and v 1 8 , respectively. Both vectors are complex, but only the real
parts are shown for the purposes of simplicity. As can be seen, v 2 contains
the low-frequency signal changes (related to respiratory motion), whereas v 1 8
captures faster cardiac motion.

where Sq (r) is the sensitivity weighting function and ρq (r, t) =
Sq (r)ρ(r, t) the sensitivity-weighted image of the qth coil. Conventional imaging methods sample k-space at the Nyquist rate
and reconstruct each ρq (r, t) using conventional reconstruction
methods. These individual coil images {ρq (r, t)}Q
q =1 are then
typically combined
using
the
sum-of-squares
algorithm,
pro
Q

ducing ρ(r, t) =
q =1 |ρq (r, t)| . However, sampling highdimensional k-space at the Nyquist rate results in low imaging
speeds which often violate the temporal Nyquist rate associated
with rapid cardiac and respiratory motions. Parallel imaging,
low-rank modeling, and sparse representation each provide a
complementary avenue for signal recovery from undersampled
(k, t)-space data. Here, we integrate these capabilities to achieve
high spatiotemporal resolution for cardiac imaging.
The proposed data acquisition scheme is characterized by the
collection of two datasets denoted as D1 and D2 here. For simplicity, we ignore the readout direction of k-space. D1 contains
data in a few k-space locations at a high temporal rate (satisfying the temporal Nyquist criterion), and D2 contains data
from sparse (k, t)-space locations. This scheme is motivated
by the signal model in (4): D1 can just be navigator data (or
training data) used to determine the temporal basis functions
{ϕ̂ (t)}L=1 , and D2 should contain imaging data with proper
contrast-weighting for determining {ψ̂ (r)}L=1 . Using navigator (or training) data for model estimation in MR dynamic imaging was introduced in [18], and the idea was later used in several
other publications (e.g., [19], [30]–[32]).
J1
1 ,Q
Let D1 = {dq (kj,1 , tj,1 )}jJ=1,q
=1 . Here, {kj,1 }j =1 covers a
few k-space locations to ensure that the temporal Nyquist criterion is satisfied, without being subject to the spatial Nyquist
constraint or any spatial resolution considerations. In prac1
often sample the central k-space based on
tice, {kj,1 }Jj =1
signal-to-noise considerations. For each kj,1 , we assume that

3085

dq (kj,1 , t) is measured for t = t1 , t2 , . . . , tN , and that this sampling rate satisfies the temporal Nyquist criterion for the underlying signal. The data in D1 can be rearranged into Q
Casorati matrices Cq = C(dq ), for q = 1, 2, . . . , Q. All the
Cq ’s share the same temporal subspace as ρ(r, t), as the inclusion of time-invariant coil sensitivity weightings Sq (r) in
(6) does not alter partial separability of the (k, t)-space data.
We can then compute the SVD
of the expanded Casorati matrix
[ CT1 CT2 . . . CTQ ]T = L=1 σ u vH and define the temporal basis functions as ϕ̂ (tn ) = Vn∗  . Having this set of predefined temporal basis functions is enormously useful in low-rank
modeling [35] because: 1) it reduces the number of degreesof-freedom in the PS model; 2) it simplifies the model-fitting
inverse problem so that only the spatial coefficients {ψ̂ (r)}L=1
need to be determined; and perhaps more importantly, 3) it improves the quality of the resulting reconstructions.
With {ϕ̂ (t)}L=1 being defined, we have a lot of flexibility in
2 ,Q
acquiring D2 = {dq (kj,2 , tj,2 )}jJ=1,q
=1 to obtain sufficient data
for determining the spatial coefficients of the PS model without
being subject to the Nyquist constraint along both the spatial
and temporal directions. The following practical factors should
be considered in deciding the (k, t)-space sampling locations
2
in a specific data acquisition scheme.
{(kj,2 , tj,2 )}Jj =1
First, with sensitivity-encoding using Q receiver coils, we can
undersample k-space by a factor of P ≤ Q according to multichannel sampling theory [17]. In practice, we choose P  Q to
avoid the well-known ill-conditioning problem associated with
conventional parallel imaging. In conventional parallel imaging,
there is a tradeoff between k-space undersampling and temporal
undersampling. By integrating parallel imaging with low-rank
modeling, the proposed method avoids this tradeoff: temporal
undersampling is allowed in PS model-based image reconstruction (as discussed in Section II-C). Therefore, the proposed
2 ,Q
method allows more flexibility in placing {(kj,2 , tj,2 )}jJ=1,q
=1
and enables sparser sampling of (k, t)-space than conventional
parallel imaging.
Second, in parallel imaging, image reconstruction requires
either explicit knowledge of each Sq (r) [15] or implicit knowledge, often in the form of auto-calibration signal (ACS) lines
measured from Nyquist samples in the central region of k-space
[16]. The proposed method can use either strategy, although we
use the latter in our implementation. Third, the proposed method
utilizes a spatial-spectral sparsity constraint to regularize the PS
model to avoid any potential ill-conditioning problem associated with (k, t)-space undersampling [35]. Sparse modeling is
most effective with “incoherent” data acquisition [23]. In our
proposed method, one can gain the desired incoherence by sampling (k, t)-space in a randomized order [22]. Simply put, for
a given kj,2 , temporal sampling should not be periodic, i.e.,
tj,2 = jΔt. Further details of our implementation can be found
in Section III.
C. Image Reconstruction
Equation (1) admits the factorization C(ρ) = ΨΦ, where
Ψij = ψj (ri ) and Φij = ϕi (tj ). Given a predetermined Φ̂, we
can reconstruct Ĉ(ρ) by solving for Ψ̂. We do this by solving

Using this simplified notation, (7) becomes

|ψ (rm )| .

Note that when λ1 = 0 or L1 = L2 , the reconstruction
problem in (7) integrates the 1 -norm regularized basic PS
model [34], [35] with parallel imaging. If we further select
L1 = L2 = min{M, N }, i.e., reconstruct a full-rank image,
then we would obtain an (r, f )-space sparsity inverse problem
similar to k-t SPARSE-SENSE [27].
We solve the convex optimization problem in (7) by using
an additive half-quadratic minimization algorithm [41], [42]
extended to handle (1,2)-norm regularization and combined
with a continuation procedure [43]. This algorithmic approach
has previously been shown to be efficient for similar problems [35]. For simplicity of notation, we define the operator
T {Ψ} = [ λλ1 R{Ψ}T λλ2 vec(ΨΦ̂F t )T ]T in order to express
the regularization constraints in (7) using an alternative (1,2)norm expression with groupings such that

R{Ψ} concatenates the rightmost columns of Ψ (i.e., ΨL 1 +1
through ΨL 2 ), and vec(·) is the vector constructed by concatenating the columns of the argument matrix. 	R{Ψ}	1,2 enforces
the subspace structure in (4), and 	vec(ΨΦ̂F t )	1 is a spatialspectral sparsity contraint widely used in CS-based cardiac MRI
(e.g., [22], [24], [25], [27], [33], [35]).
The constraint 	R{Ψ}	1,2 promotes group sparsity of

Defining x(i) as the ith group of some vector x, then the mixed

Equation (8) distributes the higher-order spatial coefficients
2
into different groups. For each L1 <  ≤ L2 ,
{ψ (r)}L=L
1 +1
each set of cardiac spatial coefficients {ψ (rm )}m |r m ∈Ω comprises a group, as does each individual noncardiac spatial co/ Ω. As a result, the cardiac region takes
efficient ψ (rm ), rm ∈
on an effective model order up to L2 and each noncardiac voxel
individually takes on an effective model order of L1 or slightly
higher. This grouping promotes a uniformly high model order
over the cardiac region and a spatially varying low model order
over the noncardiac region, introducing flexibility to the choices
of L1 and L2 . This flexibility is desirable for model order selection and region identification in practical applications because:
if either L1 or L2 is chosen too small, then the representational
power of the model is reduced, leading to model bias; if either
L1 or L2 is chosen too high, then the model becomes sensitive
to noise and reconstruction quality will be heavily dependent
on regularization. Similarly, this flexibility also allows imprecise specification of Ω, as voxels incorrectly placed outside Ω
would also be allowed to take on a higher model order. Voxels incorrectly placed inside Ω will have higher model orders
than necessary, but the model overfitting problem would still be
addressed by spatial-spectral sparsity regularization. The group
sparsity constraint reduces these potential pitfalls while still allowing the option to exactly enforce the basic PS model by using
L1 = L2 .

which is a straightforward (1,2)-norm regularized inverse
problem.
The sensitivity encoding functions {Sq (r)}Q
q =1 must also be
known in order to solve (7). In our implementation, we obtain these functions from GRAPPA [16] reconstructions of the
time-averaged measured data. We first average the measured
(k, t)-space data at each k-space location over time, yielding
a static k-space dataset {d¯q (km )}M
m =1 . We treat each of these
datasets as measurements of a function d¯q (k), which in our
implementation is downsampled in the ky direction by a factor
of P (except over the ACS region, which has NACS Nyquistsampled k-space lines). We then use GRAPPA to reconstitute
each d¯q (k), for which inverse Fourier reconstruction yields
ρ̄q (r). The sensitivity encoding functions are then defined as
Sq (r) = ρ̄q (r)/ρref (r), where ρref (r) is a coil reference image
usually produced from {ρ̄q (r)}Q
q =1 by the sum-of-squares algorithm. This strategy, which extends the method in [44] to produce
full-resolution sensitivity encoding functions, combines advantages of GRAPPA reconstruction (e.g., robustness to overlapping geometry) with the simple joint-channel reconstruction of
the SENSE [15] inverse problem.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
All data in this paper were collected according to the strategy
outlined in Section II-B, with implementation as follows. Successive readouts of {dq (k, t)}Q
q =1 alternated between D1 and
D2 such that J1 = J2 = J and tj,2 = (tj,1 + TR ) ∀j, where
TR is the time between readouts. Assuming that kx was the
readout direction, then D1 contains (k, t)-space data from Nd
unique (ky , kz )-space locations, sampled in repeating order:
kj,2 = k(j −N d ),2 ∀ j > Nd . For D2 , each ky ,j,2 was drawn from
a set consisting of 1) NACS central ky -space locations with
a sampling rate Δky satisfying the Nyquist criterion and 2)
additional ky -space locations at the sampling rate P Δky . No
k-space undersampling was performed in the kz direction. We

A. Analysis of the Low-Rank Model
Here, we present an analysis of low-rank structure in a numerical cardiovascular phantom ρ(r, t). This analysis demonstrates
the utility of the model in (4) when combined with the proposed
data acquisition/subspace definition scheme using the SVD of
D1 to define Φ̂. The phantom was generated from in vivo human
short axis MR images, and it features variable-rate cardiac and
respiratory motion. D1 was collected with Nd = 5. Section IIIB describes this phantom in greater detail.
The SVD of C(ρ) yields insight into the low-rank structure
of cardiovascular images. As  increases, signal in the spatial
“eigenmaps” {u }L=1 becomes more concentrated in the cardiac region than in the noncardiac region. Fig. 4 shows image
representations of |u | and Re{v } for  = 1, 5, 19 from the
cardiac phantom. Each eigenmap contains cardiac signal; however, by  = 19, the noncardiac signal is highly sparse, limited
to only a few voxels over the vasculature.
In the following paragraphs, we will denote C1 and
C2 as the mutually exclusive submatrices of C(ρ)
which represent the cardiac and noncardiac regions of
the image, respectively. Formally, these submatrices are
described as C1 = [C(ρ)m n ]m |r m ∈Ω,n =1,2,...,N and C2 =
[C(ρ)m n ]m |r m ∈/ Ω,n =1,2,...,N . We further denote R(Φ̂H ) as the
column space of Φ̂H , and E1 and E2 as the rank-L EckartH
Young column spaces for CH
1 and C2 , respectively. The
root-mean-square (RMS) error of a matrix X approximating
some C is given by the Frobenius norm 	C − X	F , and the
corresponding normalized RMS (NRMS) error is given by
	C − X	F /	C	F .
Here, we compare the approximation errors resulting from
H
different low-rank approximations of CH
1 and C2 . The lowest
RMS approximation errors achievable by an Lth-order PS model
H
with predetermined Φ̂ result from projecting CH
1 and C2 onto
H
R(Φ̂ ). The lowest possible rank-L approximation errors for
H
each region result from projecting CH
1 and C2 onto E1 and
E2 , respectively; these approximation errors can be calculated
directly from the singular values of C1 and C2 .

Fig. 5. NRMS error of low-rank approximations from projecting the cardiac
H
and noncardiac matrices C H
1 and C 2 onto different temporal subspaces. In
both cases, the noncardiac region can be estimated with a low-order model as
accurately as the cardiac region can with a higher-order model.

Fig. 5 shows the corresponding NRMS error values as a function of model order L. The error curves from the Eckart–Young
approximation are an indicator of the intrinsic rank properties
of each region. It is evident that very low-order representations
of the noncardiac region can match the accuracy of moderately
low-order representations of the cardiac region. Here, a rank-6
approximation of C2 is as accurate as a rank-54 approximation
of C1 (as measured by NRMS error). When compared to the
ideal regional subspaces, there only is a small loss of accuracy
associated with use of the suboptimal estimate Φ̂: the relatively
small size of this loss suggests that the intrinsic rank properties
of cardiovascular images can be successfully and practically exploited using the nested subspace strategy represented in (4) as

B. Simulation Results
We have evaluated the proposed method using the same numerical cardiac phantom. The source images for this phantom
were collected using retrospective ECG and respiratory gating, resulting in images of a single representative cardiac cycle. These images were looped and time-warped to simulate a
variable-rate heartbeat, and then spatially deformed to simulate
variable-rate respiration. The phantom image sequence contains
one complex-valued 200 × 256 frame every 3 ms over a duration of 30 s. We provide reconstruction examples using the proposed method as well as sliding window reconstructions (i.e.,
direct Fourier reconstructions of the sparsely sampled (k, t)space data after nearest-neighbor temporal interpolation), and
CS model reconstructions.
In all simulations, we sparsely sampled (k, t)-space data from
the numerical phantom. The sampling pattern was limited to a
single (k, t)-space readout line every 3 ms (the effective TR ) to
represent real-world sampling conditions. Data were collected
with Q = 1, P = 1, and Nd = 5.
Reconstructions were performed according to (7) with
a variety of parameters. Regularization parameters were
chosen for the minimum NRMS reconstruction error
	C(ρ) − Ψ̂Φ̂	F /	C(ρ)	F after a comprehensive sweep. All
reconstructions have a frame rate of 33 fps, which is equal to
the temporal resolution of the training data (i.e., 1/2Nd TR ).
Table I presents the NRMS reconstruction errors over a range
of values for L1 and L2 . Entries where L1 = L2 are denoted by
“∗,” and the full-rank (i.e., CS) reconstruction is denoted by “†.”
The smallest overall reconstruction error appears in bold. Model
order combinations where L1 > L2 are inconsistent with the assumption in (4) that L2 ≥ L1 and are therefore grayed out. The
left column of Fig. 6 depicts 2-D spatiotemporal slices from the
phantom (i.e., the gold standard) and the noiseless reconstructions which yielded the smallest NRMS error for each method.
The right column depicts the error image for each reconstruction, scaled by a factor of 2 for clarity.
Fig. 7 depicts normalized singular value curves of the cardiac
region Ĉ1 and the noncardiac region Ĉ2 of the proposed reconstruction with L1 = 25 and L2 = 64. The constraint 	R{Ψ}	1,2
successfully promoted sparsity of the noncardiac spatial coefficients indexed above L1 = 25, yielding effective ranks of

C. 2-D Human Imaging
We also demonstrate the proposed method in vivo in human
subjects. We implemented the data acquisition scheme on a
Siemens TRIO 3 T scanner using a customized FLASH pulse
sequence. Typical imaging parameters were as follows: TR =
4.6 ms, TE = 2.5 ms, flip angle (FA) = 18◦ , field-of-view (FOV)

Q = 12, Nd = 5, NACS = 42, and P = 3. The total acquisition time was 3 min. All data were collected continually with
neither ECG gating nor breath holding. The experiments were
approved by the local Institutional Review Board, and all subjects gave informed consent prior to scanning. We reconstructed
the sparsely sampled (k, t)-space data according to the proposed model with L1 = 16 and L2 = 48, the proposed model
with L1 = L2 = 48, and the full-rank (i.e., CS) model. All regularization parameters λ1 and λ2 were set according to Morozov’s discrepancy principle [45]. Specifically, the data discrepancy of our reconstructions matches the

depicts an end-diastolic snapshot from the reconstruction with
L1 = 16 and L2 = 48 as well as spatiotemporal slices through
the left ventricle from all reconstructions. The frame rate of all
reconstructions is 22 fps.
A similar experimental procedure was used to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method in human subjects with
cardiac arrhythmias. The imaging protocol remained the same,
with specific imaging parameters as follows: TR = 4.3 ms, TE
= 2.5 ms, FA = 18◦ , FOV = 286 mm × 340 mm, matrix size
= 130 × 192, in-plane spatial resolution = 2.2 mm × 1.8 mm,
slice thickness = 7.0 mm, Q = 12, Nd = 5, NACS = 32, and
P = 3. The total acquisition time was 2 min. We performed
reconstruction according to the proposed model with L1 = 15
and L2 = 64, the proposed model with L1 = L2 = 64, and the
full-rank (i.e., CS) model. All regularization parameters λ1 and
λ2 were set according to Morozov’s discrepancy principle. Fig. 9

depicts an end-diastolic snapshot from the reconstruction with
L1 = 15 and L2 = 64 as well as spatiotemporal slices through
the left ventricle from all reconstructions. The frame rate of all
reconstructions is 23 fps.
D. 3-D Rat Imaging With First-pass Myocardial Perfusion
To demonstrate the proposed method in vivo in rats, we implemented the data acquisition scheme on a Bruker Avance AV1
4.7 T scanner using a customized FLASH pulse sequence. The
images were collected with the following parameters: TR =
7.5 ms, TE = 2.4 ms, FA = 18◦ , FOV = 40 mm × 40 mm ×
40 mm, matrix size = 62 × 62 × 128, and spatial resolution =
0.65 mm × 0.65 mm × 0.31 mm, Q = 4, Nd = 1, and P = 1.
The total acquisition time was 24 min. All data were collected
continually with neither ECG gating/triggering nor breath holding. Dynamic contrast enhancement for first-pass myocardial
perfusion imaging was performed by injecting a 0.2 mmol/kg
bolus of gadolinium contrast agent (Gd-DTPA) into each subject after the start of data acquisition. The animals used in the
study were Brown Norway rats with and without ligation of the
left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. All animals received humane care in compliance with the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the National Institutes of Health, and the animal protocol was approved by the
Carnegie Mellon University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
We reconstructed the sparsely sampled (k, t)-space data according to the proposed model with L1 = 15 and L2 = 48 and
the proposed model with L1 = L2 = 48. The full-rank (i.e., CS)
solution was not computed due to memory constraints. All regularization parameters λ1 and λ2 were set according to Morozov’s
discrepancy principle. Fig. 10 depicts end-systolic snapshots
from the reconstruction with L1 = 15 and L2 = 48 as well as
spatiotemporal slices from each reconstruction. The frame rate
of all reconstructions is 67 fps. Fig. 10 depicts baseline-corrected
signal intensity curves from the four apical segments of the

septal segments, both of which are associated with LAD blood
supply [47]; the ligated artery was identifiable using the proposed method.
E. Discussion
In simulations, the proposed method with L1 < L2 yielded
the most accurate reconstruction (in the NRMS error sense)
as well as providing the most faithful representation of the true
cardiovascular dynamics. For each fixed L2 , the minimum-error
reconstruction occurs for some L1 < L2 . Each of the low-rank
results achieved significantly less error than the full-rank (i.e.,
CS) method. The superior performance of the proposed method
with L1 < L2 over that with L1 = L2 can be attributed to the
variable-rank model which better reflects the nature of cardiovascular images. In contrast, the low-rank model with L1 = L2

and the full-rank model do not distinguish between the regions of
the image, imposing regionally unspecific model assumptions.
For the human data, the proposed method with L1 < L2
shows clear improvement over the proposed method with
L1 = L2 and the full-rank (i.e., CS) methods. The reconstructions with L1 < L2 clearly depict the cardiac and respiratory
cycles without the blurring seen in the other reconstructions.
All three reconstructions fit the data to the same degree, but the
model with L1 < L2 is the most flexible: it exhibits the least
model bias and captures more subtle temporal variations than do
the other models. The other reconstructions show a clear model
bias, relying far more heavily on (r, f )-space sparse regularization than did the model with L1 < L2 .
In 3-D imaging of rat hearts, the proposed method with
L1 < L2 shows some improvement over the proposed method
with L1 = L2 , although the differences between the reconstructions are less obvious than in the human case. As in the human
case, all reconstructions match the measured data to the same
degree. The images from the proposed method with L1 < L2 are
sharper and show slightly less model bias than the images from
the proposed method with L1 = L2 . The increased similarity
between the two reconstructions can be partly attributed to the
increased reliance of the proposed method with L1 < L2 on the
(r, f )-space sparse regularization term for more highly undersampled scenarios such as whole-heart 3-D imaging. The lowrank model allows storage of C(ρ) in the factored form ΨΦ, allowing memory-efficient computation even in high-dimensional
cases for which C(ρ) cannot be stored in memory. The CS
method requires the full C(ρ) to be stored at each iteration, and
was therefore not computed due to memory limitations.
The ability to perform high-speed whole-heart 3-D imaging has wide-ranging implications. The improved spatial coverage allows for more comprehensive assessment of the heart
than methods which capture only a handful of slices. The ability to image the whole heart in 3-D also eliminates the need
for scan plane localization and excessive scout scans, as the
reconstructed volumes can be retroactively sliced in arbitrary
directions.
The proposed method requires identification of the cardiac
region Ω. In our initial implementation, cardiac regions were
identified manually from the time-averaged reference image
ρref (r). However, it may be preferable to automate this process
through image segmentation methods for more practical routine
use, especially for 3-D imaging applications.
IV. CONCLUSION
Cardiovascular MRI can be significantly accelerated by leveraging parallel imaging alongside low-rank and sparse modeling.
This paper has described a novel method to integrate these three
approaches to sparse sampling, achieving imaging speeds high
enough to represent cardiac and respiratory motion without the
need for gating or triggering. Very high imaging speeds are
even achievable in 3-D: for example, speeds of up to 67 fps at
0.65 mm × 0.65 mm × 0.31 mm spatial resolution were demonstrated in rats, depicting cardiac motion, respiratory motion, and
myocardial perfusion in a single experiment. Images generated

CHRISTODOULOU et al.: HIGH-RESOLUTION CARDIOVASCULAR MRI BY INTEGRATING PARALLEL IMAGING

by the proposed method should allow comprehensive evaluation
of the heart through the visualization and measurement of cardiac structures and functions in very high spatial and temporal
resolution.
