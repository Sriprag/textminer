Variations in the Aging Lumbar Spine

Abstract—Human spine is a multifunctional structure of human
body consisting of bones, joints, ligaments, and muscles which all
undergo a process of change with the age. A sudden change in
these features either naturally or through injury can lead to some
serious medical conditions which puts huge burden on health services and economy. While aging is inevitable, the effect of aging
on different areas of spine is of clinical significance. This paper
reports the growth and degenerative pattern of human spine using
principal component analysis. Some noticeable lumbar spine features such as vertebral heights, disc heights, disc signal intensities,
paraspinal muscles, subcutaneous fats, psoas muscles, and cerebrospinal fluid were used to study the variations seen on lumbar
spine with the natural aging. These features were extracted from
lumbar spine magnetic resonance images of 61 subjects with age
ranging from 2 to 93 years. Principal component analysis is used
to transform complex and multivariate feature space to a smaller
meaningful representation. PCA transformation provided 2-D visualization and knowledge of variations among spinal features.
Further useful information about correlation among the spinal
features is acquired through factor analysis. The knowledge of age
related changes in spinal features are important in understanding
different spine related problems.

I. INTRODUCTION
ATA mining has great potential for exploring the hidden patterns in medical datasets. These patterns can be
utilized for clinical diagnosis and understanding disease prevalence. However, most of the available raw medical datasets are
huge, widely distributed, complex, and heterogeneous in nature.
This makes medical data mining more rigorous and complex to
handle. Whether it is genomics, study of human brain dynamics,
analysis of biological relationships, image informatics, study of

infectious disease or disease diagnosis, data mining finds its
application in almost all areas of biomedicine [1].
Aging in humans is a multidimensional process of physical,
psychological, and social change in a person over time. Some
dimensions of aging grow and expand over time, while others
decline. The aging of the population in developed countries appears to be a nonreversible phenomenon. Decreased birth rates
and increased life expectancy have risen the median age [2].
This increasing median age has significant social and economic
implications in general, with tremendous load on healthcare
services. With the aging population increased numbers of musculoskeletal problems are seen. Back and neck pain are among
the most frequently encountered complaints of older people [3].
Back pain is usually associated with spine problems. The nature
of the spine makes those problems highly complex to investigate and treat. The unrelenting changes associated with aging
gradually affect almost all areas of the spine.
In the modern world, the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosing back pain and other spine problems
has become a standard practice. Clinical specialists have an extensive amount of information these days, ranging from details
of clinical symptoms to various types of biochemical data and
outputs of imaging devices. With the help of MRI, the underlying anatomical reason for back pain and spinal pathology can
be sought. In the absence of pathology such as fracture, tumor
or infection, back pain is commonly thought to come from the
intervertebral discs, the facet joints, muscles, tendinous or ligamentous insertions of the lumbar spine. However, when there is
no pathological indication from MRI, patients remain frustrated
about the cause of their back pain. Therefore, one of the reasons
to conduct this study is to explore beyond the apparent lack
of anatomical indications and reveal “hidden” information with
the help of principal component and factor analyses. Back pain
sometime originates due to age related degenerative changes in
the spine. Spine specialists do not have any reference values
to compare with patients’ age and reassure them that the result of their MRI is not indicative of any disease and the aging
effect on their spines is within natural limits. In this paper, information extracted from lumbar spine MRIs is used to visualize
and correlate the changes seen in human lumbar spine features
with aging. This study will be helpful in understanding changing characteristics of lumbar spine with the natural aging. By
finding the significance and correlation among spinal features,
clinicians will be able to understand the spinal disease prevalence in a better way. The results from this study will also be
helpful in finding the correlation between changing anatomy of
spine and back pain.
In this paper, the appearance and variation of several key
spine structures are reported in detail. In general, when the
appearance of these structures seems to vary with age, they are

often described as degenerative or age related changes (ARCs).
To date, there are no standard reference values available which
can be compared to conclude whether the changes in spinal
features are induced by natural aging or by some disease. Some
studies have tried to explore the effect of aging on specific
areas of the spine but the findings vary among the studies. For
example, some studies suggest vertebral height increases with
the age [4] while other reports decrease in vertebral height with
the age [5]. Interestingly, another study suggests that vertebral
body size increases with age in males but remains the same
for females [6]. Some studies have confirmed a correlation of
spinal variations with age [7]–[9] whereas some others have
failed to do so [10], [11]. In some studies, when looking at
specific aspects of the scan, there seems to be an extremely
strong correlation with age [12], [13]. A handful of studies are
carried out to understand the aging effect on lumbar spine. Most
of them, explore the behavior of a single feature at a time. But
due to the complex nature of the spine, many of the spinal
features are interconnected and often move together. So looking
at one feature may not always give an accurate picture.
Some studies tried to correlate age related changes to clinical symptoms but with few succeeding [14]. There is a general
agreement that changes induced by aging lead to alterations in
the thickness of the disc and muscles [15], but there are differences in the accounts of the effect of aging on the thickness
of the lumbar discs. One study stressed that reduction of the
intervertebral disc height with age is inevitable [16]. In contrast, an increase in disc height with age has been reported by
other study [17]. One study suggests that disc degeneration is
highly correlated with age and educational level [18]. Similarly,
many others have tried to link spinal aging with environment
and genetics. According to another study, the only degenerative
feature associated with self-reported lower back pain was spinal
stenosis [19]. Some studies suggest that there is a significant difference in pattern of vertebral growth in male and female [20],
[21]. Therefore, the variation in the incidence of ARC’s varies
widely between the studies. The method of assessing ARC’s
also varies widely from ordinal observer data to continuous,
computer generated data. The number and type of ARC’s varies
but are often presented to mean the same in regards the amount
of degeneration seen on the lumbar spine MRI. The variations
among the studies are due to the way of looking at the data.
Most of the studies have tried to correlate one feature at a time.
Very few have tried to correlate two or more spinal features
with aging process. The spine is a complex structure having
several bones, ligaments, joints, and muscles which often affect
one another and move together. So it is important to study the
group of spinal features simultaneously. This research is based
on the evaluation of 24 spinal features simultaneously against
the natural aging. This paper not only portrays the behavior of an
individual feature of the spine but also explores the correlation
among the features.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Overview
In this paper, information from lumbar spine MRIs is used to
visualize the variations in human lumbar spine among different

age groups. A human spine consists of bones, joints, ligaments,
and muscles. There are a total of 33 vertebrae in the human
spine: 7 in the neck (cervical region), 12 in the middle back
(thoracic region), 5 in the lower back (lumbar region), 5 that
are fused to form the sacrum, and the 4 coccygeal bones that
form the tailbone. Mechanical back pain usually comes from
the lumbar spine, so this paper focuses on lumbar spine area for
the pilot study. The lumbar spine has five vertebrae, namely L1,
L2, L3, L4, L5 separated by intervertebral discs. Fig. 1 shows
sagittal (left) and an axial (right) view of the lumbar spine MRI.
B. Dataset
The dataset used in this pilot study was taken from University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry,
U.K., in the form of patient MRIs. All the necessary ethical
approvals were obtained from the concerned bodies against the
use of data for research purposes.
Images were obtained from GE Scanners (GE healthcare
Milwaukee) at 1.5T using standard imaging protocol. All the
subjects were scanned in supine position. Images were visualized and scored using the PACS web browser (GE). The format
of data was digital imaging and communications in medicine
(DICOM). An attempt was made to keep only MRI scans
which do not exhibit any clearly visible lumbar spine pathology. However, no assessment was made into the patients clinical
symptoms.
Lumbar spine MR scans of 61 subjects were selected to develop an initial model. There were 35 female samples and 26
male subjects in total. The dataset is grouped on the basis of
age decades. Roughly 5–6 samples were selected from each age
decade. Only four lumbar spine MRIs were available for age under 10 years. Age and gender distribution of subjects are shown
in the Fig. 2.
C. Feature Extraction, Measurement, and Scoring of Data
There are several features that can be studied from a lumbar
spine MRI scan. After a thorough literature study, a list of significant lumbar spine features was prepared by the orthopedic
spinal surgeon and radiologist for the pilot study. The scoring
criteria were set to look initially at vertebral heights (L1, L2, L3,
L4, L5), disc heights (T12-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5,
L5-S1), disc signal intensities (T12-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4,

L4-L5, and L5-S1), paraspinal muscle signal intensity at L3
(both left and right), subcutaneous fat left and right, psoas muscle (both left and right), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These
24 spinal features were used in principal component and factor analysis. Although there are tools and procedures available
for automated segmentation and feature extraction [22], [23], in
this pilot study, features were measured manually by an orthopedic spinal surgeon using digital measuring tools. The measurements were repeated twice to get a good approximate and
were recorded against lumbar spine MRIs of the 61 subjects.
Vertebral and disc heights were measured from the center of
vertebras and discs and were reported in millimeters.
III. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS
One of the inherent difficulties in multivariate analysis is the
problem of visualizing data that has many variables. In such
datasets, groups of variables often move together and usually
measure the same driving principle governing the behavior of
the system [24]. In such scenarios, one can take advantage of
this redundancy of information. This problem can be simplified
by replacing a group of variables with a single new variable
[25]. Humans often have difficulty comprehending data that has
many dimensions. Thus, reducing data to a small number of
dimensions is useful for visualization purposes. With a large
number of variables in a dataset, the dispersion matrix may be
too large to study and interpret. There would be too many pairwise correlations between the variables to consider. Graphical
display of data may not be of particular help in case the dataset is
very large. For example, with 12 variables, there will be 220 3-D
plots to be studied. To interpret the data in a meaningful form,
it is therefore necessary to reduce the number of variables to a
few, interpretable linear combinations of the data, where each
linear combination will correspond to a principal component
[26]. Principal components analysis is a quantitatively rigorous
method for achieving this simplification. The full set of principal components is as large as the original set of variables. But
it is commonplace for the sum of the variances of the first few
principal components to exceed 80% or so of the total variance
of the original data [27], [28]. By examining plots of these few
new variables, researchers often develop a deeper understanding
of the driving forces that generated the original data.

PCA is mathematically defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the data to a new coordinate system
such that the greatest variance by any projection of the data
comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal
component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on [29]. In PCA, one wishes to extract from a
set of p variables a reduced set of m components that accounts
for most of the variance in the p variables. PCA is completely
reversible and the original data can be recovered from the principal components, making it a versatile tool, useful for data
reduction, noise rejection, visualization, and data compression.
In this paper, the dimension of the original data is reduced by
a factor of eight, without losing much information. Multivariate dataset is visualized by making 2-D plots and relationships
among the spinal features were understood by studying these
plots. This paper provides an easy to understand visual representation of spinal feature variations with age. For the principal
component analysis, all 24 scored features of lumbar spine were
considered. These features were measured against 61 selected
subjects.
A. Statistical Analysis and Data Standardization
Usually principal components are computed from raw data
when all the variables in the dataset have the same units. Standardization of data is often preferable when the variables are
in different units or when variance of the different columns is
substantial as in this case. If the standard deviations of variables
are different from one another, then one variable might dominate in the analysis [30]. Equation (1) gives the standardization
formula used in PCA analysis, where x is the original observed
data value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. The
statistics of raw and standardized data is shown in Table I

B. Data Visualization
The principal components were computed using the variance
technique [31]. Using MATLAB Statistical Toolbox, 24 components were computed from 24 original features. Fig. 3 shows
the first five components. It can be seen that most of the variance
(88.5%) in data is shown by the first three components. The first
component accounts for 36.08% variance, the second component accounts for 31.64%, and the third component accounts for
20.78% of the variance in whole data. As 88.5% of the variance
is explained by the first three components, the remaining components can be excluded or discarded. With PCA, 24 features
were now replaced by three principal components. The size of
the original dataset was reduced from 61 × 24 to 61 × 3. By
compressing the original data eight times, only 11.5% information is lost. Using these three principal components, original
data can be easily visualized using a single 3-D plot or making
three 2-D plots (first versus second component, first versus third
component, and second versus third component).
A plot of first versus second principal component that account
for about 68% of the variance in the data is shown in Fig. 4.
It shows the distribution of the 61 subjects ranked on the basis
of their spinal scores. Each “+” sign corresponds to a specific

subject. It can be seen that most of the subjects were dragged
on the left side of the first principal component whereas second
principal component has almost an equal distribution of the
subjects.
Each subject was labeled with the corresponding age and
gender to explore the patterns in the data. Fig. 4 shows the plot
of first two principal components labeled with their age and
gender. It can be seen that as we move along the first principal
component, age tends to change. Subjects with age 2, 8, 15,
16, etc., are located in the right or the positive half whereas
subjects with age 68,78, 88, 90, 91, etc., are located in the left
most or negative half of the first principal component. So it
can be said that the first principal component is the descriptor

for age. Also, it can be seen that the most of the subjects in
the positive (upper) half of the second principal component are
male whereas most of the subjects in negative (lower) half of the
second principal are female. Though there are few exemptions
but it can be fairly said that second principal component is
descriptor for the gender. Fig. 5 shows the plot of first principal
component versus age. It can be seen that the age increases as
we move from positive to the negative half of the first principal
component.
The plot of PC1 versus PC3 is shown in Fig. 6. Again principal
component 1 here is the descriptor for age. Principal component
three has greater concentration of female subjects in the middle
of axis or close to zero whereas male subjects tend to lie away
from zero, either between 1 to 4 or −1 to −4.
The plot of second and third principal components is shown in
Fig. 7. Principal component two shows a gender bias as majority
of male subjects lie on the positive half and majority of female

subjects lie on the negative half of component two. Component
three has a mixed distribution of subjects which does not provide
much information.
C. Correlated Features
Reducing the dimensions of the data and plotting the principal components gives an understandable visual representation
of the data. This 2-D representation uncovers some patterns in
the data but more knowledge can be extracted by exploring the
driving force with allocates or ranks the samples in 2-D plane.
Plotting first versus second principal component and exploring the driving force for the allocation of sample provides the
significance of the variables. Plot of samples and variables for
principal component one and two (accounting for 68% variance)
is shown in Fig. 8. Each blue line in this figure represents the
corresponding variables as labeled. The magnitude of line gives
the significance of that variable. The most significant here is disc

signal intensities located in the first quadrant. The other significant variables are vertebral heights and disc heights located in
the second quadrant. In third quadrant, paraspinal muscle signal
intensity shows high significance whereas fat signals and psoas
signal shows somewhat lesser significance. The least significant
is CSF, found in fourth quadrant.
Fig. 8 not only gives the significance of the input variables
but also provides the correlation among the input variables.
Looking into first quadrant, it can be seen that disc signal intensities (T12-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4) are almost overlapping each other showing that these variables are correlated
and show similar pattern. Disc signal intensities L4-L5 and L5S1 show a little different behavior than the rest. Similarly, by
looking at the vertebral heights in second quadrant, L1, L2, L3,
and L4 are very close to one another whereas L5 is bit away
from them. This shows that the aging pattern of vertebra L5
is slightly different from the rest of lumbar vertebrae. It can
also be seen from Fig. 8 that the behavior of disc height L1L2 resembles more to L3-L4 than the L2-L3. Also, disc height
L4-L5 is located slightly away from the rest. Disc height L5S1 is the least significant lumbar disc height. In third quadrant,
paraspinal muscle signal intensities left and right are close to
one another. It can also be noticed that pattern of psoas left and
fat signal left is slightly different from psoas right and fat signal
right.
Here, we have seven set of input variables as vertebral heights,
disc heights, disc signal intensities, psoas signal, fat signal,
paraspinal muscle signal intensities, and CSF. These features
are said to be somehow interconnected and affect each other.
An interesting thing about PCA representation (given in Fig. 8)
is that we can draw conclusion about the existing correlation
among these set of variables. The variables located in the same
quadrant are said to be correlated and move together. The variables which are located in adjacent quadrant (or are at right
angle) have no effect on each other. The variables in the opposite quadrant are negatively correlated to each other. In other

750

words, if one increases the other one decreases. From Fig. 8,
vertebral heights and disc heights lie in the same quadrant and
therefore are correlated. Similarly, psoas signal, fat signal, and
paraspinal muscle signal intensity are also correlated.
D. Noncorrelated Features
The magnitude of blue lines gives the significance of the respective variable with aging. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that CSF
is the least significant variable. Disc signal intensities, psoas
signal, fat signal, and paraspinal muscle signals are located adjacent to CSF meaning that they have no correlation with CSF.
However, CSF has negative correlation with vertebral heights
and disc heights. Similarly, disc signal intensities have a negative correlation with psoas signal, fat signal, and paraspinal
muscle signal. Vertebral and disc heights have no correlation
with disc signal, psoas signal, fat signal, and paraspinal muscle. It was concluded that CSF shows the least variations with
natural aging.

IV. FACTOR ANALYSIS
Factor analysis is a statistical method used to describe variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called factors [32].
Factor analysis and principal component analysis are related
to each other but are not identical [33]. Principal components
analysis is commonly used to find optimal ways of combining
variables into a small number of subsets, whereas factor analysis
is commonly used to identify the structure underlying such variables and to estimate scores to measure latent factors themselves
[34]. A generic correlation among the variables is presented in
the previous section. In this section, factor analysis is used to
get the numerical values of the significance and correlation seen
among the features.
Factor analysis was also conducted in MATLAB Statistical
toolbox. Three principal factors were extracted from dataset.
Looking at the loadings of factor one, it was found that disc
signal intensities were the most significant feature which varies
with the age. A general rule of thumb is that any variable having
loading value greater than or equal to 0.7 is said to be significant.
However, this level is said to be very high and most of the
researchers use 0.4 as an appropriate level for real-life data
analysis. In this analysis, any variable scoring greater than 0.7
are supposed to be highly significant. Variables with loadings
between 0 and 0.2 are treated as nonsignificant. Variables with
loading values between 0.2 and 0.7 are somewhat significant.
Loadings for factor one in the order of their significance is given
in Table II, with disc signal L2-L3 being the most significant of
all. Each factor has loadings for all 24 variables but here only
the nonzero values are shown.
This shows that paraspinal muscle signal intensity left-right,
psoas left-tight, and fat left-right, are negatively correlated with
disc signal intensities. Since the factor loadings for fat signal
and CSF is very low, so it can be said that they are nonsignificant variables and they do not vary a lot with the age. Psoas and
paraspinal muscles are somewhat significant. The most significant variables are of disc signal intensities. Similarly, looking
at the loading of factor two, vertebral heights are the only set

small loading values which can be neglected. The loadings for
factor two in the order of their significance are given in Table III
below.
By inspecting the loadings of factor three, disc heights are the
most significant variables. They are listed in Table IV below, on
the basis of their significance.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, principal component and factor analysis were
successfully applied for the visual analysis of age related variations seen in lumbar spine features. This 2-D representation
of multivariate data proved easy to understand and provided
meaningful information. The correlations between natural aging and lumbar spine features; vertebral heights (L1, L2, L3, L4,
and L5), disc heights (T12L1, L1L2, L2L3, L4L5, and L5S1),
disc signal intensities (T12L1, L1L2, L2L3, L4L5, and L5S1),
paraspinal muscles signal intensity (left and right), fat signal
(left and right), psoas signal (left and right), and CSF were
explored. Visualization of multivariate lumbar spine data was

done using principal component analysis. The relationship between spinal features and the significance of different features
was evaluated by factor analysis. One benefits of using factor
analysis was that the relationships between all of the variables in
the model were examined simultaneously and also in pairwise
combinations.
Some interesting patterns were observed from multivariate
analysis. Disc signal intensities were found to have a very strong
correlation with natural aging. Disc signal L2-L3 is the one
most affected by the aging. Disc heights and vertebral heights
also show a strong correlation with natural aging. Vertebral
height L3 and disc height L2-L3 were most prominent in their
respective groups. Paraspinal muscles show a moderate correlation with age; with left muscle scoring slightly higher than
right one. Psoas muscle shows a very little correlation whereas
subcutaneous fat signal and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were almost noncorrelated with age. Disc heights and vertebral heights
were found correlated to each other. Similarly, psoas, paraspinal
muscle, and fat signals were also found correlated and have a
negative correlation with disc signal intensities.
This research was based on the scores of 24 spinal features.
However, in addition to these 24 features, some other notable
features such as Schmorl’s nodes, Modic changes, vertebral
alignment, osteophytes, ligamentum flavum, and facet joints
will also be considered for future analysis.
