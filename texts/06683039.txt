Regression Based on Ensemble Synchronization

and Kaushik K. Majumdar, Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—In this paper, we propose an ensemble synchronization measure across all EEG channel pairs of a cluster based on
Frobenius norm of the phase synchronization matrix, in a 0–1 scale
enabling a direct comparison between clusters with different number of channels. Using this metric, we studied the intrahemispheric
EEG synchronization in the lower gamma band (30–40 Hz) during
1229 single trials of an audio–visual integration cross modal task
(CMT) recorded from five patients with schizophrenia and five
healthy control subjects. Using ensemble synchronization measure
and response latency of single trials recorded during the CMT as
features for logistic regression, we could classify each single trial
of EEG as belonging to a patient with schizophrenia or a healthy
control subject with 73% accuracy, with an area under receiver
operating characteristics curve of 0.83. We also propose a likelihood rating to denote the possibility of a subject belonging to the
schizophrenia group.

I. INTRODUCTION
UMAN cognitive functions involve the functional integration among different brain regions that are specialized
for certain aspects of cognitive processing [1]. To perform even
a simple task, the brain simultaneously employs multiple functionally distinct areas. Phase synchrony of neuronal oscillations
has been postulated to be an important mechanism for binding
together the activity of different brain regions in order to generate a unified perceptual experience from multiple sensory stimuli. This has been referred to as the binding problem by Treisman [2]. Phase synchronization has been implicated in sensory
perception [3], attention modulation [4], memory processes [5],

neural communication [6], synaptic plasticity [7], action planning [8], task execution [9] etc. Schizophrenia, a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by aberrant brain connectivity [1],
has been shown to be associated with task specific abnormal
synchrony in scalp EEG channels [10]. Therefore, we examined
scalp EEG phase synchronization across different brain regions
during the performance of an audio–visual integration task, in
the hope of differentiating subjects with schizophrenia from
healthy controls using a novel ensemble synchronization-based
classification metric.
Task specific single-trial EEG classification, based on signatures of brain activities, has remained a challenging problem [11]–[13]. In the past, differentiation of patients with
schizophrenia from healthy controls has been attempted using artificial neural networks on EEG with 71% accuracy [14].
In this study, our focus was on single-trial EEG classification
between schizophrenia and healthy groups. The need to use
single trials came from our intent of developing a real-time
system capable of performing such a classification. Here, we
studied ensemble phase synchronization as a feature for classification, where the ensemble would encompass all brain regions
involved in performing those cognitive tasks where a difference
in performance between subject groups is expected. We chose
to study intrahemispheric ensemble synchronization in lower
gamma band, which is involved in long-range coordination [15],
as there are reports suggesting dysfunctional long-range coordination in schizophrenia [16], [17].
In the next section, we describe the experiment and data
acquisition. In Section III, we present a theoretical description of
the quantitative methods used to process the data. In Section IV,
we present the results. The paper concludes with a Conclusion
section.
II. EXPERIMENT AND DATA
A. Subjects
Scalp EEG of five right-handed patients with schizophrenia and five healthy right-handed healthy control subjects were
randomly selected from an EEG data base of schizophrenia
and healthy subjects acquired as part of a funded research
project at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, India. The earlier study
had the approval of the NIMHANS Ethics Committee, thus
conforming to the ethical standard laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained
from all participants, prior to enrolling them into the study. The

electrodes and four bipolar electrodes for EOG, EKG, and EMG.
Acquisition was controlled using ACQUIRE, Neuroscan’s
proprietary acquisition software. Impedances for all electrodes
were reduced to a range of 5–10 K Ω. A high-pass filter of 0.1 Hz
and a low-pass filter of 100 Hz were used at the time of recording. Sample frequency was set to 1000 Hz. Stimulus delivery
was controlled by STIM2 (Compumedics, Charlotte, USA), a
stimulus presentation system which includes a dedicated audio
system and a four-button response pad for collection of fingerpress responses from the subjects. The subjects were seated in
a comfortable cushioned chair in a darkened, sound-attenuated
room facing a 17 CRT monitor at eye-level which was connected to the STIM2 system.

B. Equipment Configuration
The EEG was acquired using a 70-channel Neuroscan
SynAmps acquisition system (Compumedics, Charlotte, USA).
An electrode cap with the 10–10 International system of electrode placement was used. This included 64 monopolar scalp

This is an audio–visual integration task administered as an
event-related paradigm and designed to engage multimodal perceptual integration processes in the brain. The subjects were
simultaneously presented with an image on a computer monitor
and a sound through earphones. The gestalt image could be a
human male or female face or a scrambled image. The sound
could be a snippet of a human male or female voice or white
noise. The subject’s task was to pay close attention to both the
visual and auditory stimuli and to respond by appropriate button
press if the gender of the face in the image and the voice in the
sound matched (congruent trials, index finger press), or did not
match (incongruent trials, middle finger press) or if there was
no discernible face or voice (neutral trials, ring finger press).
Trials in which no image was presented, served as null trials
to provide stimulus free baseline while also ensuring that the
intertrial interval is random.
Of a total of 256 trials for each subject, 25% each were
congruent, incongruent, neutral, and null trials. The sequence
of image-voice combination was prespecified according to a
pseudorandom list such that the appearances of each stimulus
type were approximately equal during any interval. Half of the
incongruent trials had male face—female voice pairings and the
other half had female face—male voice pairings. For the neutral
task, the scrambled image and white noise clipping were paired.
At the onset of each trial, a fixation cross-hair was presented
which lasted for 2060 ms before being replaced by the probe
image. Stimulus onset for both visual and auditory stimuli
was 2060 ms after trial onset. The size of visual stimuli was
180 × 200 px which subtended a visual angle of 6.9◦ vertically
and 6.2◦ horizontally at a viewing distance of 60 cm. The duration of both visual and auditory stimuli was 500 ms. The fixation
cross-hair reappeared 1500 ms after the stimulus offset, with intertrial interval being 5070 ms. Fig. 1 captures the sequence of
events for each trial in the CMT EEG experiment.
The data on acquisition was band pass filtered between 0.5
and 80 Hz and notch filtered at 49–51 Hz to remove the acline noise. ECG and EMG channels were removed. Artifacts
were rejected upon visual inspection and by ICA-based methods
using ADJUST toolbox [18], [19] in EEGLAB [20] a MATLAB
toolbox for processing EEG.

B. Ensemble Synchronization Measure
We propose a quantitative measure to define an ordering of
the synchronization matrices based on Frobenius norm of a
matrix [28]. If aij is the ijth entry of a matrix A, then the entry
wise norm Ap is defined in (3) where p is a positive integer
and n is the number of channels in the ensemble. We chose
Frobenius norm AF ,by substituting p = 2 as follows:
⎞1/p
⎛
n 
n

Ap = ⎝
(aij )p ⎠

III. QUANTITATIVE METHODS
A. Hilbert Phase Synchronization
Let s(t) be any time domain signal. Let us define analytic
signal ψ(t)
ψ(t) = s(t) + j · ŝ(t) = A(t) · exp(j · ϕ(t))

(1)

where ŝ(t)
√ is the Hilbert transform of the signal
s(t), j = −1, A(t) is the instantaneous amplitude (envelope),
and ϕ(t) is the instantaneous phase of the analytic signal ψ(t).
For phase to be free from influence of amplitude, the signal
must be narrow band [21]. So we consider the lower gamma
(30–40 Hz) band for the phase synchronization analysis, which
is sufficiently narrow and also includes the 40-Hz representative component instead of entire gamma band [22] instead of
the entire 30–80 Hz [23]–[26]. Instantaneous phase difference
ϕ(t) at time t is φ12 (t) = φ1 (t) − φ2 (t) where ϕ1 , ϕ2 phases of
first and second EEG channels of the pair are. Finally, we define
the synchronization value s between a channel pair for window
Wt as follows:

2


|W |
 1 


s12 (Wt ) = 
exp(i · φ12 (t))
(2)
 |W | t=1

where |W | is the length of the analysis window W [27]. If
s = 1 signal pairs are in perfect phase synchrony and if s = 0
the signals are in perfect phase asynchrony. If there are n number
of EEG channels in a cluster an n × n symmetric matrix An (t)
is created whose ijth entry aij (t) is the phase synchronization
of ith and jth channels as calculated in (2).
The EEG signals acquired during the CMT were analyzed by
segmenting into trials from 1 s before the stimulus onset till 2
afterward. The data were band pass filtered for lower gamma
band using an equiripple FIR filter with the following specification: pass bands at 30 and 40 Hz; stop bands at 26 and 44 Hz;
pass-band and stop-band attenuation of 0.5 and 40 dB, respectively. The analysis window length used for calculating phase
synchronization was 400 ms, which was shifted by one time
point at a time. We obtained two 35 × 35 symmetric matrices
one for each hemisphere, as all eight channels on the center line
are included in both hemispheres i.e.,((62 − 8)/2) + 8 = 35
channels in each hemisphere.

(4)

The ensemble measure is computed on a 0–1 scale as given
in (4), where n is the number of channels in cluster. Here, a
value of 0 corresponds to the lowest ensemble synchronization
while 1 corresponds to highest. This enables comparison of
different clusters using the proposed ensemble measure, thus
one can tell which ensemble or which subject exhibits greater
synchronization.

C. Statistical Significance of Phase Synchronization
We test the null hypothesis H0 , that the observed phase synchronization on a channel pair s1,2 is not statistically significant
or H0 : s1,2 = 0. The decision rule used to test this hypothesis is: reject H0 if s1,2 > s0 , where for a given p-value, s0 is
the 100 × (1 − p) percentile of the distribution of s values obtained as phase synchronization between a large number of pairs
of independent shifted-time surrogate signals [29]. For Hilbert
transform-based pairwise phase synchronization over an analysis window of 400 ms, we observe s0 = 0.51 when evaluated
over 100 pairs of surrogate signals for a p-value of 0.05 or 95%
significance level. We observe a high value for s0 since the analysis window duration is small. The choice of window length is
influenced by our desire to retain good temporal resolution to
facilitate in capturing the changing dynamics.
Now, we conduct a similar null hypothesis significance testing on the proposed ensemble synchronization measure γ. The
decision rule used to test null hypothesis H0 , i.e., observed
ensemble synchronization is not significant is to reject H0 if
γ > γ0 , where γ0 is evaluated as the 100 × (1 − p) percentile
of the distribution of γ values evaluating on a large number of
ensembles of independent shifted-time surrogate signals for a
given p-value. Using the proposed ensemble synchronization
measure γ, we observe γ0 = 0.51 (= s0 ) for a 100 surrogate
ensemble with 35 channels each for a p-value of 0.05. Even
intuitively there is no reason to expect ensemble synchronization to be significant when pairwise synchronization is not or
vice versa. As expected the statistical significance threshold for
ensemble synchronization γ0 is similar to the synchronization
threshold for channel pair s0 irrespective of the number of signals in the ensemble.

D. Logistic Regression
Let m, n be number of training examples, and features extracted from data. Transpose is denoted as (•)T . The feature
matrix X is defined as follows:

T
	
X = (x(1) )T (x(2) )T · · · (x(i) )T · · · (x(m ) )T


	 (i)
(i)
(5)
x(i) = 1 x1 · · · xj · · · x(i)
n .
Here x(i) , of order 1 × (n + 1), is the feature vector of ith
(i)
example and xj is its jth feature. The extra dimension cor(i)

responds to the intercept term
 set to1, i.e., x0 = 1. Now, ith
example is represented as x(i) , y (i) , where y (i) in (6) defines
target class vector Y of order m × 1:

0, healthy control
(6)
y (i) =
1, schizophrenia.
The hypothesis function h is the sigmoid

which restricts the
output to [0, 1] range. The output hθ x(i) corresponding to
 (i) (i) 
defined in (7), depends on a weight vector θ of

The goal is to minimize a cost function by searching for a
weight vector θm in such that a hyper plane partitions the examples into its respective classes with best possible accuracy. To
avoid overfitting for training dataset leading to a loss of generalization, we perform regularization, penalizing the cost function
with weights θ and degree of regularization is controlled by
parameter λ.

trials selected for each category and stimulus type is presented
in Table III.
F. Classifier Performance
For each stimulus type, we trained a logistic regression classifier on randomly chosen subset of the selected trials that were
divided into training set (65%) and testing set (35%) using a
pseudorandom sequence. Then we compute the performance on
testing dataset by using θm in obtained on the training set with
regularization parameter set to 1. The performance of the classifier is evaluated using accuracy at single trial on training set in
tandem with testing set which reflects the real-world scenario.
Further, we report sensitivity, i.e., true-positive rate defined as
ratio of true positives to actual number of positive in the total
dataset using a threshold of 0.5, and false-positive rate defined
as the ratio of false positives to the actual number of negatives
in the dataset using a threshold of 0.5, this is equivalent to
(1– specificity).
G. Likelihood Rating
A likelihood rating lik (sj ) is assigned to each subject sj ,
which reflects the likelihood of the subject as belonging to
schizophrenia category over healthy control. This rating ranges
from 0 denoting healthy, to 1 denoting schizophrenia, computed
as the average of scores assigned to all selected single trials
tr (sj ) belonging to subject sj for a particular stimulus type,
where score (i, sj ) is the score assigned to ith selected single
trial defined as the predicted output of the classifier hθ m i n x(i)
(see (7)). If the likelihood rating is greater than threshold then the
subject is termed as belonging to schizophrenia category, else
to healthy category. In our study, a threshold of 0.5 is chosen for
performing the subject level classification:

lik (sj ) =
score (i, sj )
tr (sj ) i=1

schizophrenia,

lik (sj ) ≥ threshold.

E. Logistic Regression-Based Classification
We chose four features for the classifier viz. average hemispheric synchronization measures evaluated using the proposed
ensemble measure (4) over a 300 ms window at three intervals—
at stimulus onset (interval from stimulus onset to 300 ms afterward), at stimulus offset (interval from stimulus offset to 300 ms
afterward) and at response time (interval from 400 to 100 ms
preresponse) apart from using response latency.
We restricted the trials that are used for the classification by
the following criteria. Apart from rejecting trials at preprocessing stage, due to spurious signals, noise, etc., we chose only trials
with a correct response. Further, we selected trials in which the
response latency is at most two standard deviations away from
the mean response latency for the subject under consideration.
This ensures that trials where the subject responded either very
quickly or delayed are not considered as they might have been a
random guess due to haste or confusion. Summary of number of

IV. RESULTS
A. Behavioral Results
The behavioral performance during the CMT trials is given in
Table IV. The mean and 95% confidence interval for response
accuracy and response latency for both groups across all the
three stimulus types are listed. The mean difference in response
latency between groups was statistically significant for congruent and incongruent but not for neutral stimulus type. Therefore,
response latency for congruent and incongruent trials (but not
the neutral trials) may be a good candidate for the classification
task. The response latency among healthy controls is validated
to be faster when compared to the patients with schizophrenia
across stimulus type. Thus, neutral stimulus type might not be
a good candidate for classification task in the feature space.

values of the area under the ROC curve indicate a statistically
reliable classification performance.
In Table V, we report the average results of 100 training and
testing phases for the performance metrics at single trial and at
subject level for all three stimuli types. We observe single-trial
average classification accuracy of around 73%, and area under
the ROC curve of around 0.83. Thus, we observe that congruent
stimulus type performs better than incongruent stimulus type,
also confirmed by the ROC curve in Fig. 2. We also note that
classification of single-trial using neutral stimulus type leads
to 59% accuracy, which is closer to random guess, confirming our surmise that neutral stimulus type is not favorable for
classification using our proposed features.

B. Classifier Performance
The average performance of the classifier for each stimulus
type separately trained and tested on 100 randomly selected
training and testing sets is reported. The receiver operating
characteristics (ROC) curve for the classifier performance is
depicted in Fig. 2 for all three stimuli types. The area under the
ROC curve measures the performance of the classifier. Higher

The likelihood ratings assigned to all subjects belonging to
both healthy and schizophrenia categories for both congruent
and incongruent stimulus types are provided in Table VI. We
can infer that the likelihood ratings are on the border, i.e., around
threshold of 0.5, for those schizophrenia subjects, in whom the
illness has set in very recently as reflected by the duration of
illness specified in months.
V. CONCLUSION
EEG and MEG are noninvasive tools that acquire brain signals
with high temporal resolution using scalp electrodes and provide
valuable insights into the systems-level processing associated
with rest and cognitive ability. Phase synchronization is one
of the most effective signal processing tools to measure task
specific ensemble activities of different brain regions specialized

PRASAD et al.: SINGLE-TRIAL EEG CLASSIFICATION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION BASED ON ENSEMBLE SYNCHRONIZATION

for specific functions [30], [31]. We proposed the quantity γ
in (4) to capture a multichannel Hilbert transform-based phase
synchronization measure in 0–1 range, using which it is possible
to compare ensembles for level of synchronicity.
If single-trial EEG classification is a challenging problem
[13], then task-based classification of EEG of a patient with
mental disorder relative to that of a subject without the disorder is even more challenging [14]. Here, we have attempted
to develop a single-trial EEG-based classifier that differentiates
congruent and incongruent EEG trials in a CMT as belonging to
the schizophrenia group or the healthy control group. We have
chosen four features for logistic regression from hemispheric
ensemble synchronization at three specific intervals in addition
to response latency. We believe this approach has good potential
for developing a real-time system capable of estimating the likelihood of a subject belonging to the schizophrenia group based
on their performance on certain cognitive tasks. One of our future goals will be to validate this method on a large data set,
improvising it by including other frequency bands, while limiting to channel clusters relevant to the cognitive task under study.
