Comparison of a Single Optimized Coil and
a Helmholtz Pair for Magnetic
Nanoparticle Hyperthermia
Michael D. Nieskoski and B. Stuart Trembly∗

Abstract—Magnetic nanoparticles in a tumor can induce therapeutic heating when energized by an alternating magnetic field
from a current-carrying coil outside the body. We analyzed a singleturn, air-core coil carrying a filamentary current to quantify the
power absorbed by: a) magnetic nanoparticles at depth in tissue
and b) superficial tissue in response to induced eddy currents; we
defined this quotient as power ratio (PR). Given some limit on the
eddy current heating tolerated by an alert patient, maximizing the
PR maximizes the power absorbed in the tumor; all else being
equal, this increases the thermal dose delivered to the tumor. The
mean eddy current heating rate tolerated in four clinical studies
we reviewed equaled 12.5 kW/m3 . We differentiated our analytical
expression for PR with respect to the radius of the coil to find the
value of radius that maximizes PR. Under reasonable simplifying
assumptions, the optimal value of coil radius equaled 1.187 times
the depth of the nanoparticle target below the body surface. We
also derived the PR of two coils surrounding the body configured as
a Helmholtz pair. We computed PR for combinations of nanoparticle depths below the surface and axial locations with respect to
the coils. At depths less than 4.6 cm, the optimized single coil had
a higher PR than that of the Helmholtz pair and furthermore produced less total ohmic heating within the coil. These results were
independent of driving frequency, nanoparticle concentration, tissue electrical conductivity, and magnetic nanoparticle heating rate,
provided the latter is assumed to be proportional to the product of
frequency and the square of the local magnetic field. This paper
supports the clinical application of current-carrying coils to deliver
efficacious hyperthermia therapy to tumors injected with magnetic
nanoparticles.

I. INTRODUCTION
AGNETIC nanoparticles (mNPs) have many biomedical applications, including drug delivery, magnetic actuation for the control of cellular function, contrast enhancement
of magnetic resonance imaging, and hyperthermia therapy [1].
In mNP hyperthermia therapy, mNPs are localized in a tumor
region by means of direct injection or systemic delivery. A

current-carrying coil applies an alternating magnetic field, H̄, at
a frequency, f , to the tumor region, thereby causing the mNPs
to generate heat and elevate the tumor temperature. Heating
mammalian cells to 44.5 ◦ C for 30 min results in a cell survival fraction of 0.6% [2]. In practice, hyperthermia is used to
potentiate radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
Faraday’s Law states that a time-varying magnetic field passing through a conductive surface induces electric currents (eddy
currents) around the perimeter of the surface, which generate
local ohmic heating. These eddy currents heat healthy tissue
overlaying a tumor and thereby limit the maximum value of H̄
and f that can be safely applied to a patient. Atkinson et al. [3]
reported maximum tolerable values of the product Hf while
treating cancer patients with ferromagnetic thermal seeds; others reported the same from clinical mNP hyperthermia studies [4]–[6]. The Hf-limitation originates on the periphery of the
surface penetrated by magnetic fields, where eddy current density is highest; other hot spots may arise at skin folds [4]. Eddy
currents generate heating power in tissue according to [7]
ARD =

where σ is the conductivity of tissue, r is the radius of the circular
surface exposed to the magnetic field, μ0 is the permeability
of a vacuum, and absorption rate density (ARD) is the power
deposited per unit volume of tissue. An optimal single coil for
mNP hyperthermia would minimize the eddy current ARD at
the surface of the patient and maximize the ARD of mNPs in a
tumor below the surface.
Researchers have developed many coil geometries for induction of hyperthermia by eddy currents, localized hyperthermia
with millimeter ferromagnetic implants, and mNP and magnetic
fluid hyperthermia. These coil geometries either induce superficial eddy current heating [8] or heat an implanted magnetic
target at depth; none have been designed with consideration of
both effects. In eddy current hyperthermia, superficial tumors
are treated with coils that surround the patient [9] or external
coils placed parallel to the surface of the patient [10], [11].
To achieve significant eddy current heating in tumors at depth,
Oleson et al. [12] designed a coaxial pair of coils, one on either
side of the patient, which achieved a modest improvement in
heating, compared to a single current loop. These coils induced

eddy current heating, but were not designed to maximize H at
a magnetic target at depth.
External coils, such as a Helmholtz pair, can deliver local hyperthermia by producing a magnetic field of sufficient strength

in ferromagnetic targets implanted in a deep-seated tumor. For
ferromagnetic implants, ARD is proportional to the square of the
local H̄ [13]. A Helmholtz pair consists of two identical, coaxial, circular coils that are separated by a distance equal to the
coil radius; it generates a nearly uniform magnetic field along
the centerline between the coils. Mier et al. [14] constructed
a Helmholtz pair to heat ferromagnetic implants, while Huang
et al. [15] used what they described as a Helmholtz pair to heat
an array of ferrite needles implanted in a mouse liver.
Solenoids are also used to heat ferromagnetic implants. Park
et al. [16] used a nine-turn solenoid to induce heat by eddy
current losses in stainless-steel implants. Kimura and Katsuki
[17] used a solenoid joined to a conical solenoid for treating
oral cancer with metallic implants. Stauffer et al. [18] designed
solenoids, including a double-layer reverse-wound solenoid, a
two-layer solenoid, in which the coils in each layer are wound in
the opposite direction. This design aimed to reduce the electric
field generated between close windings of the solenoid, [11],
which can contribute to superficial heating. This electric field
effect is significant in solenoids, but is not relevant to single-turn
external coils and Helmholtz pairs.
Surface coils, such as the spiral pancake coil [18], [19], deliver
heat energy to implants at small tumor depths [18]. To increase
treatment depth, Stauffer et al. [18] designed two multilayered
solenoids, each containing three layers of four turns, placed
on either side of the patient to form a coaxial pair, as well as
a conformal surface coil, which is an oval spiral coil that is
bent slightly at each end to form a saddle shape. These authors
analyzed heating ferromagnetic implants at depth, but they did
not consider eddy current heating at the surface of the patient.
In mNP hyperthermia, the alternating magnetic field deposits
heat energy in nanometer-sized magnetic particles suspended
in a fluid that has been injected directly or delivered systemically to the tumor. Once administered to the tumor, mNPs are
endocytosed by the tumor cells [20]. To couple energy into
mNPs, Salloum et al. [21] designed two circular coils of equal
diameter with an axial separation smaller than the coil radius,
i.e., not a Helmholtz pair. Di Barba et al. [22] modified the
radii and axial separation of two coils, a main and a correcting
coil, to minimize the magnetic field variation across a finite target region. Bordelon et al. [23] modified a solenoid coil with
magnetic flux-concentrating material to increase field uniformity within the solenoid. Stigliano et al. [24] used a single turn,
sheet-like coil with a magnetic core. Jordan et al. [25] developed
a magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) therapy system consisting of a C-shaped core of high permeability, around which two
solenoidal coils were wrapped. The patient was placed in the
air gap of the core. All of these coils are intended to produce a
therapeutic value of magnetic field in mNPs injected at depth,
but the tradeoff with superficial eddy current heating was not
analyzed explicitly.
In this study, we explicitly optimized the magnetic field produced at depth by a single air-core coil with respect to the superficial eddy current heating it produces. We defined a power
ratio (PR) as the ratio of the heating power generated by the
mNPs to the heating power induced on the surface of the patient
by eddy currents. Our analysis defined the value of coil radius

a1 that maximizes PR for the single coil. We also quantified the
effect on PR of an offset z0 between the coil and surface of the
patient [see Fig. 1(a)]. This offset is necessary to accommodate
the finite diameter of the coil conductor and its cooling system.
We compared the values of PR of the optimized single coil to
the values of PR of the Helmholtz pair at combinations of mNP
target depth, d, and axial location, z  [see Fig. 1(b)]. We did not
include a solenoid surrounding a patient, because its closelyspaced coils produce an additional electric field component that
contributes further to superficial heating. To our knowledge, this
study is the first to optimize deep heating of a magnetic target
with respect to superficial eddy current heating.
II. THEORY
Table I defines the variables used in this analysis. In this analysis, we assumed that each coil carried a sinusoidal filamentary
current with a frequency between 50 and 200 kHz. In this frequency range, the retarded potential is negligible, resulting in a
quasistatic magnetic field. The attenuation in tissue is negligible at 100 kHz, with penetration depths δ equal to 3.48 m (skin

currents. We treated the skin surface as a ground plane for our
alternating field, due to the high permittivity of skin at 100 kHz.
Guy [11] used this technique, which applies the solution of Weber [28] for the potential, Φ, of a ring of charge over a ground
plane. In our case, this approximation is still more justified, because our frequency is much lower than that of Guy, who used
27.12 MHz. This makes the electrical length of our coil smaller
and gives a much higher permittivity of skin. Furthermore, our
single coil produces no intercoil electric field, such as Guy considered. With these assumptions, the electric field ∇Φ is normal
to the skin surface, but vanishes within, thus contributing no
power deposition in the skin.

where ρ is the iron concentration in the tumor, Hr and Hz are
the radial and axial components of the magnetic field, respectively, and specific absorption rate (SAR) is the power absorbed
per unit mass of iron. Intrinsic loss power (ILP) is a property
associated with the magnetic material. It can be treated as a constant under the simplifying assumption that SAR is proportional
to the product of frequency and the square of the magnitude of
the magnetic field. The concept of ILP as a constant also requires the following conditions: low frequencies (between 105
and 106 Hz), polydispersity index (uniformity of mNP diameter) greater than 0.1, and an applied magnetic field that is much
smaller than the mNP saturation magnetic field [31]. Measurements may

with  H  raised to a power slightly different from 2. In this
case, an average ILP could be computed from the data, or the

In this paper, we assumed that the radius of the circular coil
is much larger than that of the tumor containing the mNPs, and
that the tumor lies on the axis of the coil; thus, the magnetic field
remains nearly constant across the tumor. With r = 0, the radial
component of the magnetic field Hr vanishes in (5) and the axial
component of the magnetic field (6) reduces to the well-known,
on-axis expression [27], using K(0) = E(0) = π/2 [32]

For this assumption, the error in PR is less than 1% for values
of d ≥ 1 cm. In the results section, we explain why values of d
< 1 cm are not relevant to our optimization process. As seen in
(10), the optimal value of a1 is independent of parameters ILP,
f , ρ, and σ.
We substituted (11) and (12) into (10) and solved numerically
for the value of a1 (resolution of 10−6 m) that made dPR/da1 vanish, and we confirmed that PR was a maximum, not a minimum.
We checked the accuracy of our optimization by computing the
values of Hz2 and Eθ2 for the optimized single coil using finiteelement analysis (COMSOL Multiphysics Version 4.3 (Classkit

4) Determining Coil Current and Ohmic Power in a Single
Coil: The maximum tolerable eddy current heating may constrain a hyperthermia treatment. Table II lists values of Hf that

1646

were tolerated by alert hyperthermia patients heated continuously by coils in four clinical studies. These studies did not
state values of patient radius; instead, we estimated these values
based on the treatment anatomy. We converted Hf to a maximum
value of ARDEC using σ = 0.33 S/m and the relevant radius
value in (1).
Through (2)–(4), we related the mean maximum tolerated
ARDEC (Table II) to I02 , z0 , and a1 , then solved for I02 as
a function of a1 for a fixed value of z0 . The quantity I02 in
turn expressed the resistive power losses in the coil through
POhm ic = R · I02 /2, where R is the resistance of the coil, accounting for the skin effect. In practice, a cooling system must
have the capacity to transport this waste heat from the coil if
eddy current heating must be set to the value in Table II to attain
a therapeutic temperature in the tumor.
B. Helmholtz Pair Surrounding a Patient

III. RESULTS

1) Induced Eddy Current from Helmholtz Pair: Fig. 1(b)
illustrates a Helmholtz pair that surrounds a patient. We assumed
that a filamentary sinusoidal current flows through each coil in
series and that the two currents are in phase. Each coil [subscript
1 for left coil, subscript 2 for right coil in Fig. 1(b)] induces an
electric field, which contributes to ARDEC

The maximum electric field occurs at the surface of the patient, r = rpt , and approximately at the axial position of each
coil; we calculated the electric field only at the location of coil
#1, due to symmetry.
2) Power Generated by mNPs in a Helmholtz Pair: The
ARD generated by mNPs heated by a Helmholtz pair is
ARDm NP = ILP · ρ · f · ((Hr,1 + Hr,2 )2 + (Hz ,1 + Hz ,2 )2 ).

Fig. 2. Optimal single coil radius, a 1 , plotted against mNP target depth, d, at
a fixed coil offset, z0 .

where z  is the axial position of mNPs within the central volume
of the Helmholtz pair; the radial position of the mNPs is r =
rpt − d [see Fig. 1(b)].
We computed PR (9) for the Helmholtz pair using (14) for
ARDm NP and (13) for ARDEC .

To compute the PR, we used σ = 0.33 S/m for skin tissue [26], f = 100 kHz, and the measured SAR function,
SAR = 0.36 · H 1.6 for the MFL A nanoparticles at a concentration of 112 mgFe /mL of Gneveckow et al. [34]. These
are superparamagnetic magnetite nanoparticles with an average core diameter of 15 nm and an aminosilane coating [4].
In this SAR function, the exponent is somewhat less than 2,
implying ILP is not a constant. We set ILP equal to the mean
value of 1.534 nHm2 /kg (SD = 0.35) computed over the range
of 3 to 17 kA/m. We calculated a typical postinjection value
of mNP concentration in tissue as follows. According to Wust
el al. [4], a SAR of 50 W/kg was achieved if 1 mL of MFL
082AS magnetic fluid (112 mgFe /mL) was injected into 10 mL
of tumor tissue, with a field strength of 5 kA/m and frequency
of 100 kHz, or SAR = 10 · (vm NP /VTissue ) · (H/5 kA/m)2 ·
(f /100 kHz)2 · 50 W/kg. Their SAR function varied with the
square of the frequency, indicating that ILP was not a constant
for these mNPs. However, the frequency dependence was not
relevant, because we computed with their value of 100 kHz.
Using their median SAR value of 130 W/kg in twenty-two patients and their mean magnetic field strength of 4.5 kA/m, we
computed that 0.32 mL of magnetic fluid existed in 1 mL of tumor tissue postinjection. We multiplied this ratio by the syringe
concentration, 112 mgFe /mL, to get a typical, clinical tissue
concentration of 35.84 mgFe /mL.
Our numerical solution of (10) showed that the optimal radius
a1 is proportional to d, with a slope of 1.187 and R2 of 0.9998
for z0 < d (see Fig. 2). The optimal value of a1 is independent
of ILP, f , and ρ. It is not physically meaningful to maximize PR
for d < 1 cm, as will be explained below.
Fig. 3 shows how PR varies with d and a1 , for a fixed z0 ;
the optimal value of a1 falls on the same straight-line locus
defined in Fig. 2. Also plotted are lines of constant I02 ; these
vary with a1 , but are independent of d, as shown by (2)–(4).
PR is not plotted for d < 1 cm, because PR goes to infinity
at a rate of 1/a21 , and I02 goes to infinity at a rate of 1/a61 . For
such small values of d, a therapeutic tumor temperature could be
attained with a PR far less than the maximum attainable value.
This would entail smaller values of coil current and a value of

advantages. Therefore, there is no practical need to maximize

Fig. 5 shows the PR of a Helmholtz pair in a central crosssection of the patient’s body. The normalized axial position is
the axial distance z  from coil #1, divided by coil separation a2 .
For example, a normalized axial position of 0.5 indicates that
the mNPs are midway between the two coils. Fig. 5 has the same
orientation as the Helmholtz pair in Fig. 1(b).
Fig. 6 shows the effect of increasing the Helmholtz pair radius
a2 with a fixed patient radius, effectively increasing the offset
z0 . The normalized axial position z  /a2 was set equal to the
value in Fig. 5 with the highest PR for each value of d (shown
as circles).
Fig. 7 compares the PR of the optimized single coil to that of
the Helmholtz pair, with the normalized axial position for the
Helmholtz set equal to the value with the largest PR in Fig. 5.
To confirm the theoretical expression for PR (9), we computed the values for Hz2 and Eθ2 for the optimized single coil
radius a1 = 3.6 cm at target depth d = 3 cm numerically using

z  /a 2 = 0.5). The quantity I02 is not plotted, because it equals 0.44 (kA)2 for all
values of d and z  . There is no distinction between kA and kA·turns because I02
flows through each coil in series. This plot has the same orientation as Fig. 1(b).

coil radius, a 2 . The radius of the patient is fixed at 15 cm. For each target depth,
the target is assumed to be at the optimal axial location, as shown in Fig. 5.

COMSOL Multiphysics [33]. The maximum error for Hz2 and
Eθ2 , when comparing the numerical results to theory, was 0.47%
and 0.35%, respectively. The results for ARDEC (4) are shown
in Fig. 8. The coil current, I0 , was set equal to 1.57 kA to produce the mean tolerated ARDEC of 12.5 kW/m3 (see Table II).
In the numerical results, the maximum value of ARDEC occurs
at a1 = r, as assumed in our theory.
IV. DISCUSSION
The goal of this study was to compare the performance of a
Helmholtz pair and an optimized single coil in mNP hyperthermia. Our analysis demonstrates that optimizing the single coil
maximizes PR for only a single value of d, as shown in Fig. 2.
Fig. 3 quantifies how departing from the optimal a1 reduces PR.
To treat multiple depths d with a single coil, it would be best
to optimize that single coil for the largest expected value of d.
For example, a1 = 4.76 cm is optimal for treating d = 4 cm,
resulting in a PR equal to 8.96. If d were to decrease to 2 cm with
coil radius fixed at 4.76 cm, the PR increases to 30.7 (although
it is not optimal), indicating that a1 = 4.76 cm treats 2 cm ≤ d
≤ 4 cm effectively. We note that for shallow depths, it may be

COMPARISON OF SINGLE OPTIMIZED COIL AND HELMHOLTZ PAIR

Fig. 7. Plot of PR of the optimized single coil and the Helmholtz pair against
mNP target depth, d. For both types of coil, z0 = 1 cm. For each target depth,
the single coil has the optimal radius from Fig. 2, and the Helmholtz pair has
the target at the optimal normalized axial location z  /a 2 from Fig. 5.

Fig. 8. Plot of ARDE C against the radial position from the center of the
single coil, r, for z = z0 [see Fig. 1(a)]. ARDE C was computed using (4), (2),
(3), and using COMSOL Multiphysics [33]; every tenth data point computed
by COMSOL was plotted above. The single coil radius a 1 = 3.6 cm and coil
current I0 = 1.57 kA from Table III were used to set the maximum ARDE C
equal to the mean tolerable value in Table II.

desirable to supplement heating of mNPs with intentional eddy
current heating, but we have not analyzed that strategy here.
Fig. 4 shows that the PR of the optimized single coil increases
with an increasing z0 . However, the quantity I02 increases at a
faster rate. For example, at d = 2 cm, an increase in z0 from
1cm to 3 cm results in a 14.3 fold increase in I02 , but only a
1.56 fold increase in PR. A larger I02 generates more heat in
the coil and thus requires a more powerful cooling system. In
practice, a limit on cooling power likely will require using the
smallest value of z0 that gives a safe clearance between the coil
and patient.
Fig. 5 illustrates the well-known uniformity of the magnetic
field along the central axis of a Helmholtz pair [35]. Fig. 5
also shows that the maximum PR is not fixed midway between
the two coils for the case of shallow depths. Specifically, as d
decreases, the maximum PR shifts toward a normalized axial
position z  /a2 of 0 or 1 (location of coil #1 or coil #2). A future
study will quantify PR as a function of mNP target location with
coil separation closer than the Helmholtz distance.
For a fixed patient radius, the PR and I02 of the Helmholtz pair
both rise with increasing coil radius a2 , but not in proportion.
For example, in Fig. 6, at d = 12 cm, as a2 increases from 17

to 18 cm, PR increases by 1.2 fold, while I02 increases by 1.27
fold. Actual ohmic heating in the coils would increase by a still
larger factor, due to the larger circumference of the coil. Fig. 6
shows the effect is far more pronounced for d ≤ 6 cm. As with
z0 for the single optimized coil, limits on cooling power likely
require use of the smallest value of a2 for the Helmholtz pair
that gives safe clearance to the patient.
Fig. 7 directly compares the PR of the Helmholtz pair to the
optimized single coil. The Helmholtz pair yields a greater PR for
4.6 cm < d ≤ 15 cm. However, for d < 4.6 cm, the optimized
single coil gives a greater PR and less ohmic power, as shown in
Table III. At a target depth of 3 cm, the single optimized coil has
a 2.1 times larger PR than the Helmholtz pair. The optimized
single coil has a value of I02 5.5 times larger than the Helmholtz
pair, but its circumference is nine times smaller than the sum of
the circumferences of the two Helmholtz coils. Therefore, the
ohmic power generated by the optimized single coil is 0.62 times
the power generated by the Helmholtz pair, assuming constant
coil conductivity per unit length.
By rearranging (9), the magnitude of the magnetic field at a
target depth, d, can be computed from

ARDEC · PR
.
|H| =
ILP · ρ · f
Using ILP, f , and ρ as defined at the beginning of the results
section, the mean ARDEC (Table II), and a PR of 3.87 for a
target depth of 15 cm (see Fig. 7), the magnetic field equals
2.97 kA/m or 37.3 Oersteds.
Although not shown in our results, the addition of a second
optimized coil with an equal radius on the opposite side of the
patient, such as described in [12], increased the PR four-fold at
d = 15 cm. However, the two coils achieved a less significant
increase of 1.05 at shallow depths, such as d < 5 cm. The point
of intersection in Fig. 7 did not significantly change with the
addition of this second coil, and we did not consider this case
further in this work.
A single filamentary current can be used to model sheetlike coils designed for hyperthermia, because alternating

NIESKOSKI AND TREMBLY: COMPARISON OF A SINGLE OPTIMIZED COIL AND A HELMHOLTZ PAIR

current concentrates towards the inside radius of a circular sheet
geometry. Papagiannopoulos et al. [36] showed such concentration through numerical analysis of pairs of circular sheets. There
are two physical causes for this effect. Not only is the inner radius the shortest path for current flow, but the sinusoidal current
generates a magnetic field in the coil, inducing eddy currents
which oppose current flow in the region between the inner and
outer radii while augmenting current flow at the inner and outer
radii. Therefore, the circular sheet coil can be modeled approximately as two filamentary currents, one at the inner radius and
one at the outer radius of the coil. However, the magnitude of
the current flowing at the outer radius is a small fraction of that
at the inner radius current and could be ignored in a first-order
model. The first-order model also would apply to the singleturn sheet-like coil designed for mNP hyperthermia described
by Stigliano et al. [24], and consequently the results of our
optimization would apply to it as well.
The steady-state temperature in the superficial tissue heated
by eddy currents can be computed by the method of Hand
et al. [37]. However, the value of this temperature is of less
interest, because we have included the maximum tolerable eddy
current heating rate known from clinical studies in our definition
of PR. The values of the Hf product that produced the greatest
superficial heating tolerated by patients were quantified during
these clinical studies, and these values of Hf directly express
eddy current ARD, according to (1). Once it is known that a certain heating rate built into PR is barely tolerable, the associated
temperature at that anatomical site has less significance.
The value of PR does not directly imply the values of steadystate temperatures in the tumor heated by mNPs. To find tumor
temperature, one can apply the Green’s function derived by
Giordano et al. [38] for the bioheat equation expressed in onedimensional, spherical coordinates. A solution for steady-state
temperature would follow from integrating the Green’s function numerically over time, to represent steady thermal power
deposition from the mNPs, and by integrating over the radial positions defined by the tumor, to represent the thermal power contributed by each radial shell of tumor tissue containing mNPs.
Of great significance to this calculation of steady-state temperature is the value of tumor blood perfusion, which may not be
well known in the clinical setting; similarly, the blood perfusion
in adjacent normal tissue must be known as a function of local
temperature [38]. It is nonetheless advantageous to maximize
PR, regardless of the particular values of tumor and normal tissue blood perfusion in a given patient. For example, Table III
shows that the optimized single coil has more than twice the PR
of the Helmholtz pair for a mNP target 3 cm below the skin surface. All else being equal, the mNP density, ρ, in tissue heated
by the optimized single coil could be half the value required
by the Helmholtz pair, according to (9). This fact extends the
number of clinical cases in which therapeutic heating could be
attained through use of the optimized single coil.
V. CONCLUSION
This study compared an optimized single coil to a Helmholtz
pair for use in mNP hyperthermia. We defined the PR as the

1649

ratio of induced heat in mNPs to surface eddy current heating,
and we used this metric to compare coil geometries. The mean
eddy current heating rate tolerated in four clinical studies we
reviewed equaled 12.5 kW/m3 . Analysis demonstrated that the
optimal coil geometry depends on the mNP target depth. For
a patient radius of 15 cm, the optimized single coil achieves
a greater PR and less ohmic heating than the Helmholtz pair
at mNP target depths d < 4.6 cm. However, at greater depths,
the PR of the Helmholtz pair exceeds the PR of the optimized
single coil. Increasing the PR decreases the mNP concentration
in tissue required for a therapeutic temperature, all else being
equal. In future papers, further improvements to PR will be
investigated by modifying the Helmholtz pair presented here
and by optimizing the radius and offset of a pair of coils external
to the patient.
