Objective: To develop multivariate vector-ARMA (VARMA) forecast models for predicting emergency
department (ED) demand in Western Australia (WA) and compare them to the benchmark univariate
autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and Winters’ models.
Methods: Seven-year monthly WA state-wide public hospital ED presentation data from 2006/07 to
2012/13 were modelled. Graphical and VARMA modelling methods were used for descriptive analysis
and model ﬁtting. The VARMA models were compared to the benchmark univariate ARMA and
Winters’ models to determine their accuracy to predict ED demand. The best models were evaluated
by using error correction methods for accuracy.
Results: Descriptive analysis of all the dependent variables showed an increasing pattern of ED use with
seasonal trends over time. The VARMA models provided a more precise and accurate forecast with smaller conﬁdence intervals and better measures of accuracy in predicting ED demand in WA than the ARMA
and Winters’ method.
Conclusion: VARMA models are a reliable forecasting method to predict ED demand for strategic planning
and resource allocation. While the ARMA models are a closely competing alternative, they
under-estimated future ED demand.

1. Introduction
Time series analysis (TSA) and forecasting are used extensively
in business for tactical, strategic or operational planning and management [1]. However, use of TSA in health care has been limited.
Wargon et al. [2] identiﬁed nine studies on ED forecasting in their
systematic review: only ﬁve used TSA and the remainder used generalised linear regression models. Four of the ﬁve that used TSA
were single centre studies. The other study applied the univariate
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARMA) model on multicentre region-wide ED presentations [3]. This study suggested
that ARMA was a useful tool for predicting ED demand. However,

the models and forecasts need to be updated when more data
become available.
There are signiﬁcant challenges of ever-increasing demand and
costs of health care systems in developed countries [4]. The systems struggle to adequately cope with demand, which manifests
as emergency department (ED) overcrowding [5]. Hence, access
to and quality of health care is diminished and this is a threat to
patient safety and public health [6,7]. The knowledge gained from
an accurate prediction of the amount of future ED demand would
provide valuable information for strategic planning and possibly
ameliorate ED overcrowding. A complex system involves multiple
inter-related factors. In order to understand the relationship
between factors such as age, place of treatment, Australasian
Triage Scale (ATS) and disposition, accurate predictions of future
demand can provide detailed information for policymakers.
Our aim is to develop multivariate vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) forecast models [8] for predicting emergency

department (ED) demand in Western Australia (WA) and also, to
compare the performance of the VARMA models with univariate
ARMA models [9] and Winters’ method [10].
2. Methods
2.1. Study setting, design and data source
Western Australia (WA) is the largest state of Australia, and
occupies one-third of the continent with a total area of over

976,790 square miles. Its population was 2.57 million in 2014
and 80% of the population reside in Perth, the capital city. Health
services are concentrated in metropolitan WA which has a population of more than 2 million served by public EDs. There are four
large central metropolitan hospitals (one exclusively paediatric),
three smaller outer metropolitan hospitals, and two privately
administered public hospitals. There is also one private hospital
ED. In non-metropolitan WA, the population is served by 73 small
public EDs, with six being regional centres (larger hospitals). The
health system in WA is typical of Australia.

This study was a population-based time-series analysis using
monthly ED presentations from all state-wide public hospitals,
for the seven-year period 2006/07 to 2012/13. Data were extracted
from the WA Emergency Department Data Collection (EDDC) database, a core dataset routinely collected and managed by the WA
Department of Health for statutory purposes. All WA EDs except
one metropolitan private hospital ED contributed data to this
database.
2.2. Variables and measures
The dependent variables in the study were the numbers
of ED presentations stratiﬁed by age group (<15 years, 15–44,
45–64 and P65), place of treatment (metropolitan WA,
non-metropolitan WA), triage category (1–5) [11] and disposition
(admitted, transferred, non-admitted). Each variable category is a
time series of ED presentations observed over time. The addition
of all the series in each variable category gives the total number
of ED presentations to WA state-wide public hospitals. Triage is a
rating tool for prioritising ED patients for treatment based on
clinical urgency to allow patients with more urgent conditions to
have earlier treatment. The Australasian Triage Scale (ATS) has
ﬁve triage categories [11]: ATS 1 – Critical/Resuscitation
Condition (requires immediate treatment), ATS 2 – Emergency/
Very Urgent Condition (requires treatment within 10 min),
ATS 3 – Urgent Condition (requires treatment within 30 min),

ATS 4 – Semi-Urgent Condition (requires treatment within
60 min) and ATS 5 – Non-Urgent Condition (requires
treatment within 120 min). The independent variable was time
(monthly).
2.3. Descriptive analysis
We used SAS Econometric Time Series (SAS/ETS) Software for
modelling and forecasting (version 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA). All graphs and plots were generated using TSA package in
R project.
Before the modelling process, the data were split into two sets:
one used to develop the models (test data) and the other to validate the models. The ﬁrst ﬁve-years of monthly ED presentations
were modelled and the last two-year monthly ED presentations
were held for model validation. The test data were examined for
trends and variability using visual analysis of the time plots, autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function
(PACF) plots of ED presentations for each variable and subgroup.
The ACF and PACF plots provided a graphical representation of
the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation structures of ED
presentations. The ACF and PACF plots can be used to determine
to what extent and magnitude the past values of ED presentations
are related to future values. These plots provided an insight into
how reliable past ED presentations would be for forecasting future
ED demand [12].

2.4. Modelling techniques
2.4.1. VARMA models
This allowed us to study the dynamic relationships between age
groups, place of treatment, triage category and disposition, as well
as improving the accuracy of predictions. The VARMA method was
used to develop multivariate time series models to forecast
state-wide WA public hospital ED demand. The VARMA modelling
technique allowed several dependent time series to be modelled
together and accounted for both cross- and within-correlations of
the series.
Suppose zt is a k-dimensional stationary ED presentation series,
then the class of VARMA (p, q) models employed to forecast ED
demand for each category can be expressed as:

2.4.2. ARMA models
The ARMA models are developed from univariate time series
modelling methods with a modelling process that is similar to
the VARMA method. However, unlike the VARMA models, where
several time series are modelled together, the ARMA method
allows only one time series to be modelled at a time. This method
was developed by Box and Jenkins [13]. The model was developed
to provide a general framework for forecasting non-stationary
observed time series data.
Suppose xt is a stationary observed ED presentation series, then
the class of generalised ARMA models for forecasting ED demand is
of the form:

/ðBÞxt ¼ l þ hðBÞat

UðBÞzt ¼ /0 þ HðBÞat

where /ðBÞ ¼ 1  /1 B  /2 B2  . . .  /p Bp is the autoregressive

P
where t is time, /0 is a constant vector, UðBÞ ¼ Ik  pi¼1 Ui Bi and
Pq
HðBÞ ¼ Ik  i¼1 hi Bi are two matrix polynomials of orders p > 0
and q > 0 respectively; B is a back-shift operator deﬁned by
Bxt ¼ xt  xt1 and at is a sequence of independent and identical distributed random vectors with mean zero and positive-deﬁnite
P
covariance matrix a .
For any two time series z1t and z2t , VARMA (1, 1) can be
expressed as

operator of the model; hðBÞ ¼ 1  h1 B  h2 B2  . . .  hq Bq is the
moving-average operator of the model; B is a back-shift operator
deﬁned by Bxt ¼ xt  xt1 ; and the variable at  Nð0; r2 Þ is a random
error or white noise. This modelling approach is an iterative process
to identify a best forecast model through three steps.

The mathematical theory, and the applications of forecast processes associated with multivariate time series analysis of
VARMA forecast models is complex and has been discussed in
detail in a textbook by Tsay [8].

1. Model identiﬁcation: First, historical data were used to identify
a tentative model, where seasonal and/or non-seasonal trends
and variability in the data were examined and removed by differencing and appropriate transformation, in the case of variability. Once stationarity was achieved, the autocorrelation
function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF)
plots of the stationary ED presentation data were examined
by comparing them to theoretical ACF and PACF to tentatively
identify the orders for autoregressive (AR) and moving average
(MA).

2. Model estimation: The parameters of the tentatively identiﬁed
model were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation
and the resultant residuals were checked for white noise.
3. Diagnostic check: Various statistical techniques were used
including Akaike Information Criterion, Schwarz Information
Criterion or Schwarz Bayesian Criterion and residual analysis
of ACF and PACF to judge the goodness-of-ﬁt of the model. If
necessary, an alternative model was considered and the process
was repeated until the best model was obtained.
The detailed mathematical theory associated with Box–Jenkins
forecast modelling has been discussed in a textbook by Box,
Jenkins & Reinsel [9].
2.4.3. Winters’ method
This method of forecasting was an exponential smoothing
model that employed three smoothing steps or equations to forecast time series data – one for the level, one for the trend and
one for seasonality, also known as triple exponential smoothing.
A detailed description of this is provided by Chatﬁeld [10]. There
are two forecast methods (equations) for Winters’ method (additive and multiplicative); in our case we used the additive forecast

67

method since the ﬂuctuation of the data appeared relatively constant. The forecast model of Winters’ additive model was given by

2.5. Model validation and forecast comparison
Our main aim was to assess the accuracy and validity of multivariate VARMA models to provide accurate forecasts of ED demand
in WA hospitals. This was evaluated by calculating the various
measures of accuracy for each sub-group of the variables used
(age, place of treatment, triage category and disposition). The

measures of accuracy used were mean absolute error (MAE), root
mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE). Using the test data, we generated two-years-ahead forecast data. The two-years-ahead forecast was subtracted from the
two-years-holding data to obtain forecast residuals. The resultant
residuals were used to compute the values for MAE, RMSE and
MAPE. The ARMA models and Winters’ forecasting method were
used as the benchmarks for comparison. ARMA models are reliable
forecasting techniques that have been used to provide forecast, for
ED demand [14]. Winters’ method was one of the univariate time
series forecasting methods widely used for predicting seasonal
data [10].
3. Results
3.1. Descriptive results
The time series plots for age groups, place of treatment, triage
category and disposition are presented in Figs. 1a–1d. The time
plots of all the groupings of the variables depicted a long-term
increasing trend with little or no visible variability except ATS 5
which shows a decreasing trend.
The ACF plots of ED presentations and the ﬁrst order difference
are presented in Figs. 2a–2d. These plots conﬁrmed the increasing
trends in all variable categories and the decreasing trend of ATS 5.
The ACFs decayed over time with a persistent autocorrelation

69

structure signiﬁcant at lags of up to about one year. The ACF plots
of the ﬁrst order difference exhibited signiﬁcant autocorrelation at
lags 12 and 24, suggesting that ED presentations followed a
12-month seasonal trend. The increasing trend and seasonality of
the data showed by the ED presentation series in all the variable
categories indicated the non-stationarity nature of the data and
both seasonal and non-seasonal differencing were performed.
3.2. Modelling and forecasting results
Our results from the post-sample forecast and hold-up sample
for model validation of the three forecasting methods for each variable by categories are presented in Table 1. We presented forecast
errors (MAE, RMSE and MAPE) for the 12-months-ahead forecast
for age group, place of treatment, triage and disposition categories.
The lower the value of the three measures of accuracy the better
the performance of the forecast method. Since MAE and RMSE
depended on the mean value of the variable, which hinders comparisons of models for predicting variables that had different mean
values [2], MAPE would be easier and understandable for examining forecast accuracy or model comparison. Moreover, all the three
measures of accuracy gave similar results and we thus concentrated on the values of MAPE for the model comparisons.
The graphical representation of the observed and forecast data
for each category of age group, place of treatment, triage category
and disposition are presented in Figs. 3a–3d. The plots provided

comparisons of the predicted ED demand with the observed ED
presentations (hold up data) for 24 months (2 years). The forecast
from all the three modelling methods appeared consistent in terms
of directions. The VARMA plots provided predictions that deviated
the least from observed data compared to ARMA plots, while the
Winters’ plots provided the mean forecast of the observed data.
The VARMA models provided smaller values of the accuracy
measures for almost all the variable categories. The ARMA models
were also competing models to VARMA which performed creditably well especially for ATS 2, 4 and 5. The VARMA and ARMA
models were used to produce a forecast of ED demand in
Western Australia. The average forecast per month for each category over a ﬁve-year forecast horizon and the corresponding average annual growth rate (AAGR) are presented in Table 2. The
results demonstrated that ED demand would increase over the
next ﬁve years in all age groups, place of treatment, triage (except
ATS 5) and disposition categories with the greatest contributions to
this growth coming from age 65 years and over, metropolitan WA,
patients classiﬁed as ATS 2 and 3, and admitted patients. Our ﬁndings indicate that ARMA models underestimate ED growth forecasts (Compare AAGR in Table 2).
4. Discussion
In this paper, we developed both multivariate and univariate
time series methods to forecast WA state-wide public hospital
ED demand by age group, place of treatment, triage category and
disposition category. Three different methods were used. Two of
the methods, VARMA and ARMA models, are based on stationarity
of the data whilst the Winters’ method is not. All three methods are

widely used for forecasting data with a seasonal component. We
examined the performance of each method by comparing two
years ahead forecast with two years holding period of the data.
All three forecasting methods were able to forecast the direction
and magnitude of ED demand with reasonable monthly forecast
errors. The best forecast method was the VARMA models, while
ARMA models were a closely competing method. However,
ARMA models under-predicted ED demand. The forecasts produced by the Winters’ method were not accurate enough, and even
produced a poor forecast for some variables. Both VARMA and
ARMA plots indicated that the models were able to capture the seasonal variation of the data, but the Winters’ model could not, making VARMA and ARMA models suitable for modelling ED demand.
Our ﬁnding that multivariate models provided more accurate forecasts for ED demand than univariate models is consistent with the
ﬁndings of Jones and colleagues [12].
Our ﬁndings revealed prominent seasonal patterns in all the
series except the ATS 1 category. Apart from ATS 1 where signiﬁcant autocorrelation was observed in lag 12, all other categories
of ATS showed signiﬁcant autocorrelation at lag 12 and 24 depicting a seasonal trend with a period of 12 months. Our forecasts
show an increase in ED demand in all age groups, place of treatment, triage category and disposition category except ATS 5 which
declined over the forecast period. These ﬁndings are also consistent
with our previous study [15] and the ﬁndings of others [16–18].
The general outcome from the models is that state-wide ED
demand in WA will increase in the next ﬁve years with the highest
growth coming from age 65 years and over, metropolitan WA, ATS
2 and 3 and admitted patients. The main drivers of these increases
may be the growing and ageing population, increasing disease

complexity, patient expectations and other social factors such as
drug and alcohol abuse [16,19,20].
5. Strengths and limitations
The use of the VARMA modelling process allowed us to account
for the inter-relationship between all the variables. The inﬂuence
of each series on the other was fully addressed by the VARMA
modelling approach thereby improving forecast accuracy. This
makes the forecast produced by VARMA models more reliable for
decision making. Disaggregating the data into age groups, place
of treatment, triage category and disposition provides an insight
into which categories of patients and areas are major contributors
to the growth of ED demand in WA that require immediate attention. Judging from the accuracy of the forecast provided by VARMA
models and their ability to provide insight into the dynamics of ED
demand by various categories, VARMA modelling is a useful technique that can help to improve planning, resource management
and decision making for ED services.
The VARMA modelling techniques provide an insight to the
dynamic relationships of the series involved, but practically are
very complex. Very large time series data points are required for

implementation when many series are involved. Due to this limitation, we were unable to include disease categories because we
have only seven years of data for this analysis. However, the
VARMA model was found to be the best forecasting method.
When larger datasets become available, they can be used to provide accurate forecasts.
The VARMA model was generated under the ‘business as usual’
condition (status quo modelling). We did not perform ‘what-if’ scenarios (scenario modelling) to take into account potential changes
in population projections and in health policy and clinical practice,
as well as potential bed, workforce and budget constraints that
may affect ED use.
This study did not attempt to identify the drivers of ED presentations or seasonal ﬂuctuations since it aimed only to identify the
best modelling method for ED presentations in WA. Further study
is underway to identify the factors/drivers that contribute to the
increasing trend of ED presentation.
The outputs of demand modelling and forecasting (status quo
and scenario) underpin the development of health services
strategic planning that is used by health services planners, and
guide workforce modelling, infrastructure and ﬁnancial
modelling.

6. Conclusion

Acknowledgments

VARMA models are a reliable forecasting method to predict ED
demand by patient subgroups, and provide a more accurate forecast for ED demand than the normal or standard univariate
ARMA and Winters’ methods. We observed that the prediction
deviations (residuals) were smaller in the VARMA models, resulting in smaller conﬁdence intervals, making VARMA models an
attractive method to forecast ED demand for strategic planning.
The ARMA models are a closely related competing model for forecasting ED demand. However, they under-estimated ED future
demand compared with the VARMA models.

We thank Jennifer M Atthowe, the manager of the Western
Australian Emergency Department Data Collection, for providing
the data and the Data Linkage Branch at the Western Australian
Department of Health for extracting data. We also thank
Elizabeth Rohwedder, senior program manager, at Health System
Improvement Unit and Margo O’Neill, principal analyst, at
Clinical Modelling Unit, the Western Australian Department of
Health for their support.
