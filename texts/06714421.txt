A Shocking Past: A Walk Through Generations of
Defibrillation Development
Sarah R. Gutbrod and Igor R. Efimov∗ , Member, IEEE

Abstract—Defibrillation is one of the most successful and widely
recognized applications of electrotherapy. Yet the historical road
to its first successful application in a patient and the innovative
adaptation to an implantable device is marred with unexpected
turns, political and personal setbacks, and public and scientific
condemnation at each new idea. Driven by dedicated scientists
and ever-advancing creative applications of new technologies, from
electrocardiography to high density mapping and computational
simulations, the field of defibrillation persevered and continued to
evolve to the life-saving tool it is today. In addition to critical technological advances, the history of defibrillation is also marked by
the plasticity of the theory of defibrillation. The advancing theories
of success have propelled the campaign for reducing the defibrillation energy requirement, instilling hope in the development of a
painless and harmless electrical defibrillation strategy.
Index Terms—Defibrillation, electrical stimulation, history of

I. INTRODUCTION
HE history and future of defibrillation offers a unique
perspective on the evolution of a critical medical therapy and illustrates the far-reaching influences that continue to
shape its development. The evolution of defibrillation has been
circuitous, often stalled and at other times experienced great
leaps of advancement. Over several centuries it has traversed
long geographical distances, circumvented political and cultural
roadblocks, and faced bold scientific and public opposition. Despite the many external setbacks, new advances in technology
have persistently driven defibrillation from the naı̈ve application of newfound electricity by amateurs in the 18th century
to the powerful, life-saving, clinical tool it is now in the 21st
century. This path navigates many seemingly unrelated fields
of science and technology, including zoology, physics, power
and circuitry engineering, physiology, cardiology, and computer modeling. Dogged key individuals, who dedicated their
careers to reversing sudden cardiac death and understanding the
biophysical interaction between the heart and applied electric
fields, propelled the study of defibrillation across generations

and continents. Many reviews detail the history of fibrillation and defibrillation [1]–[6]; this review, however, will focus
specifically on the critical role biomedical engineering technology has played in shaping the optimization of delivery, reduction
in shock strength, and the ever-evolving, working hypothesis of
the mechanism of success and failure of defibrillation.
II. PATH TO RESTORING LIFE BEGINS
A. Early Naı̈ve Applications of Electrotherapy
The powerful therapeutic potential of electricity applied to
the human body was recognized long before the language of
physics and physiology were formed to explain the observed
phenomena. In ancient times, electric fish were used in both
South American and Greek societies for remedial purposes [7].
The therapeutic use of the fish’s natural abilities is shrouded in
myth; the efficacy of shocks delivered in such an uncontrolled
manner is no longer known. The first significant technology
to impact the development of defibrillation was the invention of
instrumentation that could produce and store electricity and then
provide controlled electrical discharges, known as a capacitor.
These initial devices included Otto Guericke’s sphere and the
Leyden jar shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b) [8]–[11]. As these devices
were relatively mobile and available to the fascinated public, it
did not take long for them to be used to deliver electrotherapy
in the hospitals and in the field. By the late 18th century, there
are multiple reports detailing the application of external shocks
as a form of resuscitation; the first of which was a 1788 human
resuscitation case reported by Kite [12] (see Fig. 2).
Unfortunately, theoretical support for the use of electrical
stimulation lagged behind anecdotal evidence of success and
there was widespread unregulated use of electrotherapy without
a mechanistic foundation by both amateurs and hospitals alike.
The first reports of electrical stimulators in hospital settings date
back to 1767 and 1777 at London St. Bartholomew and King’s
hospitals, respectively [13]. Electric shocks of up to ∼50 000 V
were naively applied with a wide range of electrode placements
and materials. Purely empirical animal experiments conducted
during this time period did not add much enlightenment to when
and why electrical stimulation worked [14]. The combined lack
of an understanding of electrical conduction within the cardiac tissue and the lack of an existing method for monitoring
the electrical activity of the heart significantly limited these
experiments. Important mechanistic strides were made in the
related field of animal electricity and muscle contraction, led
by Galvani [15], but anecdotal success appeared sufficient for
electrotherapy in humans. In 1792, the first clinical recommendations for resuscitation were published [10], which were based

on the experience of the Lancashire Society for Recovery of
Apparently Dead. These recommendations included “inflation
of patient’s lungs and application of electric shock to the chest in
the area of the heart” [see Fig. 2(b)]. By 1802, the use of electric
resuscitation was endorsed by the Royal Humane Society [16].
The invention of the voltaic battery by Alessandro Volta
(Italy), based on the analysis of John Hunter’s elegant dissections of the electric organ of the electric fish [17], provided
another critical technological advance [11] [see Fig. 1(c)]. The
problem of how to provide an adequate and compact power
source to the discharge device will remain a significant aspect
of the design of all future developments of defibrillators, including those used today. With the first reliable steady source
of current, electrotherapists could now travel easily with their

However within a century, fascination with electrotherapy
would drastically fall in public opinion to such a degree that all
interest in researching defibrillation would be wiped out from
both lay and scientific communities. The new negative outlook
on electrotherapy emerged following the widespread uneducated application of electricity to all manners of disease with
outrageous claims of miraculous results. The credibility of defibrillation suffered greatly because of close ties with raising
the dead and restoring life, which acquired widespread notoriety through popular literature. The public easily misunderstood and misappropriated defibrillation to sorcery and quackery. John Shoemaker (United States) wrote the following on
electrotherapy, “No remedy of equal value has been so misused;
so much exaggerated as to intrinsic worth; or so greatly decried
as worthless. . . the mechanism for operating electric force has
improved much more rapidly than the intelligent use of it” [18].
Ostentatious experiments such as John Aldini’s, whose experiments on hanged or guillotined criminals in England and France
many deemed grotesque, further damaged the public opinion of
electrotherapy [1]. When defibrillation came back into favor a
century later it would no longer focus on portable field applications but instead would be confined to the ac wall outlets of
research laboratories and operating rooms. It would take another
century to bring the therapy back to public access. Eventually
defibrillation is put back to the hands of the layperson, delivered
in the community as well as the hospital, with the distribution
of Automated External Defibrillators in the late 1990s and early
2000s. In 1999, the American Red Cross included defibrillator
training as part of the standard CPR training course to increase
awareness on how to use the publicly accessible devices. The
success of these devices relies on sophisticated detection algorithms that do not require medical training to identify fibrillation
and deliver shocks only when safe and appropriate.
Although the appeal of electrotherapy declined, research investigating the condition underlying cardiac death continued.
In the second half of the 19th century, several key European

1468

physiologists including Carl Ludwig (Germany), John
MacWilliam (Great Britain), and Edmé Vulpian (France) published fundamental observations on the onset and progression
of arrhythmias, including electrically induced (“faradization”)
ventricular and atrial fibrillation. In 1899, physiologists Prevost
and Batelli at the University of Geneva reported the first application of experimental defibrillation in a footnote of a paper on
ventricular fibrillation (VF) initiation by faradization. Prevost
and Batelli used a capacitor discharge in the range of 2400–
4800 V, delivered along a vector from the small intestine to the
mouth, to defibrillate a canine in faradization-induced VF [19].
Regrettably this important observation, which was essentially a
rediscovery of defibrillation, went largely unnoticed for a number of years due to poor presentation and perhaps, lack of unmet
clinical need. Defibrillation only gained relevance when electricity companies like Consolidated Edison and Bell Telephone
Laboratories offered funding for research on electrocution to
protect their workers [20], and doctors, whose patients were accidentally overdosed on anesthetics, began looking into how to
revive them [21].
C. Drawing Geographical Lines in the Development Path
At this point in history, the development of defibrillation diverges geographically. For many years there are simultaneous,
isolated developmental paths in the Western world and the Soviet Union, both of which contribute to the current state of
defibrillation.
In America, William Kouwenhoven and physicians at Johns
Hopkins University conducted experiments delivering ac to
electrodes in direct contact with the canine myocardium to induce fibrillation. An accidental second shock arrested the fibrillation and reproduced Prevost and Batelli’s successful defibrillation results. The American group then systematically investigated the effects of the strength (2200 V, 0.4–8 A) and
duration (0.1–5 s) of applying 60-Hz ac to canine hearts in fibrillation [22]. These experiments were conducted with transthoracic and epicardial electrodes, and concluded that transthoracic
defibrillation required five times the current as epicardial defibrillation. They also tested the effects of the size of the electrodes
on defibrillation success. Another American group, Ferris et al.,
compared 60-Hz ac, 25-Hz ac and dc and found that 60 Hz
required the least current [23]. However, they were testing long
duration shocks of >1 s. They hypothesized that there was no
difference in defibrillation threshold (DFT) for shorter shocks,
without performing the study. This may be why ac shocks persisted much longer in the West. In the 1930s, Carl Wiggers
from Western Reserve University in Cleveland further investigated the causes of defibrillation failure, which still occurred in
40%–50% of the previous studies. He meticulously described
the compounding effects of VF-induced ischemia on the ability
to defibrillate successfully. Wiggers also observed that a very
brief and strong countershock was most successful and introduced an idea he called serial defibrillation, which delivered a
series of 3–7 weaker alternating current shocks with a 1–2 s
interval between shocks [24]. Ultimately Wiggers’ work led to
the first clinical success.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MAY 2014

In Russia, we owe a great deal of development to Lina Shtern
and Naum Gurvich. Lina Shtern had a direct connection to
the Prevost and Batelli experiments, as she formerly studied
defibrillation under Prevost’s direction in Geneva. When she
moved her lab to Russia, she primarily focused on her favorite
subject—neuroscience. However, following a 1933 report from
Johns Hopkins University, which provided compelling support
for resuscitation and reignited interest in public, scientific, and
industrial communities, she assigned a project on defibrillation
efficacy of traditional ac stimulation to her new graduate student
Naum Gurvich. In 1939, Gurvich and Yunyev published results
on the superiority of monophasic dc shocks over the traditional
ac, delivering shocks in a range from 2000 to 6000 V [25], [26].
DC provided safety advantages as well as a decreased risk of
reinduction. The Russian group became the first to notice evidence of more pronounced shock-induced mechanical stunning after exposure to ac compared to dc [27]. Gurvich also
introduced more complexity into the capacitor circuit used to
deliver the transthoracic shock by adding an in-line inductor
(see Fig. 3) [25], [26]. This design was the first significant step
in waveform optimization to reduce DFT and cardiac damage
associated with strong electric shocks. Improving the circuit in
this way dispersed the energy better in time, decreasing the peak
current, and lengthening the duration.
D. Drawing Geographical Lines in the Development Path
Although defibrillation in the research setting was gaining
traction, doctors did not successfully apply defibrillation in a
patient until 1946 by Claude Beck and his team from Western
Reserve University Hospital [28]. When conducting a thoracic
surgical procedure on a 14-year-old boy, the patient’s heart began to fibrillate. Since Beck already had direct access to the
heart, he applied 110 V, 1.5 A ac shock, after using an ECG
to confirm VF. He did not include the duration of the shock in
his case report. Upon delivery of the second shock, the heart
returned to a fast but regular rhythm and the patient made a
full recovery. In the 1950s, Claude Beck produced a compelling
educational film, which provided detailed instruction of intraoperative open-chest resuscitation and presented personal accounts
of a dozen of patients saved by defibrillation. In this film, he also
expressed the need for wide public education and deployment
of resuscitation.
In 1956, Paul Zoll expanded the successful clinical use of defibrillation to include transthoracic application on humans with
710 V, 15 A ac for 0.15 s [29]. The widespread use of electrocardiography provided a method to confirm VF as well as a way to
confirm the successful defibrillation. The data associated with
the repeated successes would promote the public perception of
defibrillation as a viable therapeutic option instead of repeating
the earlier 18th and 19th century failed attempts for legitimacy
and acceptance.
III. ERA OF OPTIMIZATION
With a proven clinical application, the question began to
change from “Can we defibrillate VF?” to “How can we defibrillate VF better?” Defibrillation research entered an era of

incremental optimizations of the waveform delivered. American
researchers finally caught up to the Soviet research, concluding
that dc was superior to ac shock. Bernard Lown led the investigations in the United States, 25 years after Gurvich [26],
reaching the same conclusion that using an inductor to attenuate
the capacitor discharge was necessary to limit myocardial damage [30]. He proposed the Lown waveform, an underdamped impulse with duration of 2.5 ms for clinical use to reduce rise time
and pulse duration. Lown also published his ideal circuit components: a capacitance of 16 μF and an inductance of 100 mH
to allow for widespread replication of his results [31]. Bohumil
Peleska (Czechoslovakia) also conducted rigorous instrumentation evaluations to minimize peak voltage and current as well
as minimize total energy [32]. These two goals remain the principle aim of current defibrillation development. John Schuder
from the University of Missouri at Columbia introduced the idea
of short-circuiting the capacitor after a time delay to remove the
low voltage decreasing exponential tail after observing that it
could reinduce fibrillation [33]. The truncated exponential pulse
waveform gained popularity because the relatively simple circuit lent itself to implementation of a fully implantable, automated, catheter-based defibrillator conceived independently by
both Schuder et al. [34] and Mirowski et al. [35] in 1970 and
successfully implanted in the first human patient by Mirowski
et al. [36]. Ironically, the idea of an implantable automatic defibrillator was greeted with a great degree of skepticism by Lown
and Axelrod [37].
A. Theory Shapes Therapy
Concurrent with the timeline of the implementation of defibrillation, there is a parallel account of the evolution of the

mechanistic underpinning of successful defibrillation, also
driven by key advances in technology and physiology. Defibrillation is not a therapy that was born out of a strong biophysical
foundation. The mechanistic studies trailed far behind the empirical clinical use of the tool. Many recent studies still try to
clarify the interaction between applied shocks and arrhythmic
propagation.
The original motivation behind applying a shock across the
heart was to incapacitate or stun the tissue. The temporary electrical stunning hypothetically allowed the heart time to “reset.”
Gurvich was the first to propose that the shock actually stimulated the heart [27] but even this description did not offer a
lot of guidance for designing an optimal shock delivery system.
Traditionally, defibrillator design has been driven by the need
to simplify and minimize the circuitry necessary to provide a
relatively safe shock that can achieve high shock strength above
the DFT. Scientists did not begin to investigate what influences
the DFT or to propose hypotheses to improve defibrillation efficacy based on biophysical mechanisms until the mid 1960s,
when Gurvich proposed the use of a biphasic waveform [38].
Based on these observations, he developed the first transthoracic biphasic defibrillator, which became the standard of care
in Soviet Union in early 1970s, as shown in Fig. 3 [27].
Early 20th century experiments at Washington University in
Saint Louis led Garrey to postulate that the inducibility and continuation of VF was related to the mass of myocardium [39]. In
1975, Douglas Zipes presented experimental evidence in support for this theory as it applied to chemical defibrillation mechanisms. By selectively depolarizing regions of tissue chemically,
Zipes demonstrated that a critical mass of myocardium could
maintain VF and lead to defibrillation failure [40]. Therefore,
a “critical mass” theory was proposed that a shock simply had

1470

to capture enough tissue to succeed. Alternatively, the theory
of upper limit of vulnerability [41], [42] supported the idea
that regions of weak potential gradient were critical to providing a source for maintaining a large enough area for early
activation and the continuation of fibrillation. Several groups
designed defibrillation schemes and new lead configurations to
target areas of low potential gradient after shock delivery to
reach the critical mass necessary for success [43]–[45]. Both of
these theories supported the claim that high voltage shocks were
necessary for success. However, as evidence emerged to support a delicate balance between defibrillation and myocardial
damage, scientist began to look for new ways to decrease the
energy required for success. Many studies have been conducted
using a diverse set of parameters to measure myocardial damage; some of which have had contradictory conclusions about
whether clinical shocks are innocuous. However, shock strength
is also positively correlated with the perception of pain, which
can be severe for defibrillation shocks. The potential risk of
myocardial damage and the pain, both physical and psychological, associated with implantable devices has driven research for
lower energy defibrillation schemes.
In the 1980s and 1990s, empirical studies began to emerge,
supporting the idea that Gurvich’s biphasic damped sine
waveform and other biphasic waveforms were superior over
monophasic pulses [46]–[48]. As high-power amplifier designs
improved, new shape waveforms could be easily implemented in
research environments; rectilinear, triangular, trapezoidal, and
triphasic waveforms were tested [46], [47], [49]–[51]. Scientists began to probe the response to applied shocks at various
scales, especially with computational studies. Using resistor–
capacitor simulations to model the cardiac cell membrane’s response to applied shocks, several groups demonstrated a shape
dependence on efficient delivery of energy [52]–[54], which
was supported by empirical observations. Based on these predictions the truncated biphasic exponential waveform delivers
energy inefficiently due to the time constant of the cell and
an ascending trapezoidal waveform has the lowest DFT. Years
later, this waveform would also be shown to cause less damage
independently of the decrease in efficacy [52].
B. Revolution in Scientific Methodology Drives the Evolution
of Defibrillation
Still, further advances required a more in-depth understanding of the mechanism of defibrillation success and failure. Fortunately, two new scientific research methodologies were introduced that revolutionized the field’s ability to study cardiac
stimulation mechanistically with high resolution. The first was
a computational approach called the bidomain model [55]; the
second was an experimental technique using potentiometric fluorescent voltage-sensitive dyes embedded in the membrane [56]
called optical mapping [57]. Both of these tools were integral in
supporting a new hypothesis that emerged describing the transmembrane response to applied stimulation. This new theoretical
hypothesis, called the virtual electrode polarization (VEP) theory, transformed the direction of defibrillation research. VEP is
reviewed in detail elsewhere [58], [59], [60]. Briefly, the external

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MAY 2014

application of an electric field induces regional polarizations
known as the virtual cathodes and virtual anodes, often opposing the regions of structural or functional heterogeneity. A
representative example is shown in Fig. 4 [61]. As a secondary
effect, new wavefronts and phase singularities can be initiated
from these regions that can lead to defibrillation failure [62].
The theoretical foundation of this idea was formulated by Sobie
et al., which they termed “generalized activating function” [63].
The landmark implication of this new theory was that defibrillation efficacy was not only dependent on the properties of the
electric field but also on the intrinsic properties of the tissue
structure and conductivity in a predictable fashion.
One such computational study that was vital to the accurate
prediction of a VEP tissue response to externally applied currents was conducted by Sepulveda, Roth, and Wikswo almost a
decade before Sobie generalized the VEP idea to 3-D. The authors published critical simulations on how unequal anisotropy
in tissue conduction results in a complex spatial dependence
of potential distribution in response to large currents, which
influences the location and, equally importantly, the shape of
the virtual electrodes [64]. Experiments and simulations conducted in the 1990s and early 2000s, explained the position of
shock-induced phase singularities and the chirality of shockinduced reentrant circuits [62], [65], [66], [67]. New studies
emerged demonstrating shock polarity dependence [68], [69]
and optimal timing sequences targeting vulnerable phases of an
arrhythmia [70]–[72]. In contrast to earlier studies, these new
optimizations could be mechanistically explained.
IV. PROMISE OF FUTURE ADVANCES
Current research again focuses on optimizing serial defibrillation, delivering a temporal sequence of low-energy shocks
based on the frequency of the arrhythmia, with great reductions in DFT [73]–[76]. High-frequency ac strategies are also
being revisited [77]. All of these new strategies aim to develop a
painless and damage-free solution to restoring a regular rhythm
without losing efficacy. Due to the diversity of arrhythmia properties, and the clear indication that DFT is dependent on intrinsic
tissue conditions, many of these research approaches look to develop patient-specific energy delivery schemes.
Mirroring the history of defibrillation, the clinical field has not
been quick to adopt new defibrillation strategies. Even small but
powerful increments such as switching to a biphasic waveform,
faced opposition to incorporation into clinical devices [78]. New
methodologies that require a substantial shift in strategy also
require significant redesigns of circuitry and therefore, the reduction in voltage and energy must be equally considerable
without loss of safety to merit redesigns. That is not to say
that there has been no progression in implantable devices since
the switch to biphasic waveforms. Clinical improvements have
focused on sensing algorithms, programmability, battery miniaturization, and lead development [79] with great success. Shock
delivery in both internal and external defibrillation has recently
been improved by incorporating impedance compensation into
the shape algorithm [80], [81]. Although simple in concept,
the idea of altering the waveform to provide more consistent

current delivery was the first step in patient-tailored defibrillation strategies and provides hope that with future research,
a convincing patient-specific defibrillation strategy will be developed and implemented. Studies are also being conducted in
novel energy strategies including a renewable or self-serving
device and leadless defibrillation.
Efforts of many generations have carried us to our current use
of defibrillation, and they have simultaneously demonstrated the
tenacity of the field to overcome setbacks and the creativity necessary to drive development. Continuous new advancements in
monitoring and data acquisition techniques have shaped and will
continue to shape the resolution and scale at which scientists can
probe the state of cardiac tissue. These advances will continue
to drive the mechanistic understanding of defibrillation to new
depths and propel new innovations in the implementation of defibrillation. In the words of Vice-President Hubert Humphrey,
who was responsible for eventually bridging the geopolitical
divide between Soviet and American defibrillation groups, research on defibrillation can be described as “at least a partial
conquest of death. . .[it is] the oldest category in the world—but
one which commands our newest efforts” [82].
