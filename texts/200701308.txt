Abstract
Basic publication–citation matrices are used to calculate informetric indicators such as journal impact factors or R-sequences.
Transforming these publication–citation matrices clarifies the construction of other indicators. In this article, some transformations
are highlighted together with some of their invariants. Such invariants offer a rigorous mathematically founded way of comparing
informetric matrices before and after a transformation.

1. Introduction: the basic publication–citation matrix
A basic publication–citation matrix, in short: p–c matrix, is a table showing publication and citation data needed for
the calculation of an informetric indicator such as a journal impact factor or an R-sequence (Liang, 2005). Examples
of the use of p–c matrices can be found in (Frandsen & Rousseau, 2005; Ingwersen, Larsen, Rousseau, & Russell,
2001; Liang, 2005). Data in such matrices are usually shown in chronological order. Publication data may be given
either row by row, as we will do in this article, or column-by-column, as done, e.g. in (Ingwersen et al., 2001): these
two approaches are logically equivalent.
Consider Table 1: it shows the number of published articles and citations for a hypothetical set of articles under
study. Such an article set is traditionally a journal, i.e. all articles published by a particular journal, but it may also be
an institute or a country or any other entity of interest. Recall that citations originate from a pool of citing objects such
as all articles published in journals covered by Thomson Scientific. Again, also this pool may vary depending on the
type of study. Other alternatives include: all journals covered by one particular JCR category, or all journals covered
by a regional citation database (Jin & Wang, 1999; Wu et al., 2004). Recently, a framework for impact calculations
and generalizations, taking the pool explicitly into account has been proposed by Rousseau (2005) under the name
conglomerate.
The first column and the first row of Table 1 refer to periods. In classical citation studies time intervals, denoted
as Ik , k = 1, . . ., max(n,m), are years, but it is quite feasible to use other periods such as quarters of a year, on the one
hand, or decennia on the other. The second column gives the number of published articles by this particular article

set. Concretely, Pi denotes the number of articles published by this article set during period i. The other columns are
citation columns. The symbol Ci,j denotes the number of citations received in year j by items published in year i. If i > j
then Ci,j is not defined, or may be set equal to zero (we do not take preprint citations into account). Such zeros are not
shown in the publication–citation table. The submatrix of the p–c matrix consisting of all Ci,j (i = 1, . . ., m; j = 1, . . ., n)
is called the citation submatrix (in short: the c-submatrix) of the p–c matrix. The first column, providing publication
data, is called the publication submatrix (column) or the p-part. Observe also that in general m = n. The whole matrix
consisting of the publication submatrix as its first column, and the citation submatrix is the p–c matrix, denoted as M.
To the best of our knowledge such p–c matrices were first described and used by Moed, Burger, Frankfort and van
Raan (1983).
In this article, we will propose some useful transformations of this p–c matrix. These transformations will act on the
complete p–c matrix M, but may leave some submatrices unchanged. Use of these transformations will be illustrated
in the framework of generalized impact factors and of Liang’s theory of rhythm indicators (Liang, 2005). In the spirit
of Klein’s Erlangen program (1872) we will introduce invariants of transformations of the publication–citation matrix.
Recall that the German mathematician Felix Klein (1849–1925) proposed – successfully – a new approach to geometry
(Boyer and Merzbach, 1989). According to the Erlangen program geometry is the study of invariants of a set under
certain group transformations. These groups actually classify the different types of geometries, or stated otherwise:
any classification of groups of transformations becomes a codification of geometries. In our case, these invariants
tell us which information presented in a p–c matrix stays unchanged through a particular transformation, and which
information is altered, the ultimate aim being a classification of publication–citation studies.
2. Generalized impact factors and their relation with rhythm indicators
In Frandsen and Rousseau (2005), a general approach to the notion of an impact factor has been introduced. In
this framework, an analysis based on several years of publications becomes possible. In traditional synchronous or
diachronous citation studies only one row or one column of the citation submatrix is used. In a synchronous approach
the citation period is fixed, in the diachronous approach the publication year (which is the cited year) stays fixed. The
more general Frandsen–Rousseau approach to citation studies considers a larger basis than traditional studies. In this
type of studies, publication and citation intervals are usually years.
The following notation is used:
np denotes the length of the publication window,
nc denotes the length of the citation window,
Yp is the first year of the publication period,
Yc is the first year of the citation period.
Two alternatives are proposed in Frandsen and Rousseau (2005): the so-called general impact factor and the
alternative impact factor. The general impact factor of an article set S, denoted IFS (np , nc , Yp , Yc ), is defined as:
np −1 nc −1
CYp +i,Yc +k
(1)
IFS (np , nc , Yp , Yc ) = i=0 npk=0
−1
i=0 PYp +i

L. Liang, R. Rousseau / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 249–255

251

This formulation counts from the first year in the publication period and citation period to the last similar to the
calculation of the diachronous impact factor although it also can be used for synchronous analyses. In this notation,
the classical Garfield–Sher impact factor of journal J in the year Y is IFJ (2, 1, Y − 2, Y). Indeed:
1 0
CY −2,Y + CY −1,Y
CY −2+i,Y +k
=
(2)
IFJ (2, 1, Y − 2, Y ) = i=01k=0
PY −2 + PY −1
i=0 PY −2+i
The ‘alternative impact factor’ of a set of articles S, denoted AIFS (np , nc , Yp , Yc ), is defined as:
np −1 nc −1
CYp +i, Yc +i+k
AIFS (np , nc , Yp , Yc ) = i=0 k=0
np −1
i=0 PYp +i

(3)

For example, AIFS (1, 3, Y, Y) denotes a 3-year diachronous impact factor. It refers to the publication year Y and
uses citations received in three consecutive years, beginning in the publication year Y. The immediacy index of journal
J in the year Y is AIFJ (1, 1, Y, Y), but it may also be written as IFJ (1, 1, Y, Y). Finally, AIFS (s, 1, Y, Y + t) is another
interesting generalized impact factor:
s−1
CY +i,Y +t+i
(4)
AIFS (s, 1, Y, Y + t) = i=0
s−1
i=0 PY +i
It denotes the average number of citations per article, over a period of length s, received t years after publication.
Here, and in all other examples we assume that the data necessary for the calculations are available in the p–c matrix.
As we assume that the reader is familiar with generalized impact factors we do not go into details. Moreover, in this
article, impact calculations are just provided as an example of the use of a p–c matrix.
Consider now a fixed n × n p–c matrix (from now on we take m = n). Because of the dimensions of such a table we
can calculate AIFS (n − k + 1, 1, I1 , Ik ), k = 1, . . ., n, but not AIFS (s, 1, I1 , Ik ), s > n − k + 1.
The creation of the rhythm indicator (Liang, 2005) includes a key measure namely Ck , which denotes the average
number of citations per paper in the kth year after its publication (k = 1 to n − i + 1, where k = 1 refers to the publication
year) and which was constructed as the expected value of the observed Ci,i+k−1 for any possible i. Just like the general
impact factor IF and the alternative impact factor AIF, the rhythm indicator is created from the p–c matrix. In the
notation of Table 1, Ck is equal to
n−k+1
Ci,i+k−1
i=1
(5)
n−k+1
Pi
i=1
n−(i−1)

The rhythm indicator compares Ei = Pi k=1 Ck with Oi = nj=i Ci,j by forming the R-sequence Ri = Oi /Ei .
It can easily be seen that Ck is just a special AIF, namely: Ck = AIF(n − k + 1, 1, Y1 , Yk ), though the background and
original intention for creating Ck and AIF are totally different.
3. The R-transformation
This transformation on a p–c matrix M is denoted as R. It maps the matrix M to the p–c matrix R(M). It leaves the
publication column P unchanged: the first column of R(M) is equal to P. R transforms the c-submatrix C with elements
Ci,j into the c-submatrix of R(M) with elements Ri,j where

(6)

The first equation establishes the matrix elements Ri,j as a weighted sum of citations, the second one as the number
of publications multiplied by a generalized impact factor (5).
The P-column is a trivial invariant for the R-transformation. More importantly, the R-transformation leaves the
total sum of the elements of the citation submatrix invariant. Hence, the R-transformation can be considered as a
rearrangement of the p–c matrix. The proof of this statement is given in the following theorem.

This proves Theorem 1. 
Theorem 1 shows that the R-transformation is the basic transformation underlying the theory of R-sequences as
studied in Liang (2005), see also Liang, Rousseau, and Shi (2005) and Liang, Rousseau, and Shi (2006).
4. The AV-transformation
The more (citable) articles a journal, an institute, etc. publishes the larger its citation potential. In order to take this
effect into account one may use the following averaging transformation, denoted as AV. Applied to the matrix M this
yields the matrix AV(M) = A. The elements of AV(M) are equal to the elements of M divided by Pi , the first element of
the ith row of M:
Ai,j =

Mi,j
Pi

(8)

In particular, we see that the first column of A consists of ones. The citation part of the AV-transformed matrix shows
the average number of citations received per published article. The elements of the matrix A are used when calculating
diachronous impact factors. The matrix A itself is called the mean p–c matrix.
Deriving elements denoted Ak from AV(M) in a similar manner as Ck has been derived from M, yields (see Eq. (5)):
Ak =

5. The R̄-transformation
The R̄-transformation is the multiplicative analogue of the R-transformation. It maps the matrix M to the p–c matrix
R̄(M). R̄ too leaves the publication column P unchanged. Further, R̄ transforms the c-submatrix with elements Ci,j into

L. Liang, R. Rousseau / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 249–255

the c-submatrix R̄(C) with elements R̄i,j where

The R̄-transformation leaves the product of all elements of the p–c matrix elements invariant. Hence, it can be
considered as a multiplicative rearrangement of the p–c matrix. The proof of this statement can easily be derived from
the analogous statement about R.

Proof
Consider the p–c matrix ML Its p-column is equal to the p-column of the matrix M, while the elements of its
c-submatrix are each equal to the logarithm of the elements of M’s c-submatrix. Applying Theorem 1 to ML yields:

This proves Theorem 2. 

Proof
This follows immediately from Theorem 2 by replacing Ci,j by Ai,j and all Pi by 1.
Note that the multiplicatively transformed Ai,j are actually geometric averages. 
The R, R̄ and AV-transformations are internal transformations as they are only based on the given p–c matrix. We
will now consider another transformation involving an external factor, namely the used pool.
6. Normalizing with respect to the size of the pool
The potential number of retrieved citations clearly depends on the size of the used database (pool). As the p–c matrix
usually covers several periods it is often a good idea to normalize it with respect to the size of the pool during that
period. Let Zj denote the size of the pool in interval Ij , j = 1, . . ., n. Then the size-normalized p–c matrix is denoted as
N. With respect to the original case the publication column does not change, but Ci,j is transformed into Ni,j = Ci,j /Zj .
This transformation is especially useful when studying relatively small databases or large time periods. Indeed,
taking the database SCI-extended (SCIE) as an example, we know that the total number of SCIE’s records has been

254

L. Liang, R. Rousseau / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 249–255

increasing over the past half century. In previous publications (Liang et al., 2005, 2006) we have shown the influence
of this increase on the R-sequence of the journal Science. Comparing Science’s R-sequence calculated based on the
normalised p–c matrix with that calculated based on the original p–c matrix we found that for the earlier years values of
the R-sequence increased after normalization, while for the more recent years they decreased. The same phenomenon
occurred for Science’s impact factor.
If one wants the total sum of elements in the c-submatrix to be invariant for this type of transformation than it must
be defined slightly differently, namely as:
n n
Ck,s
Ci,j

n k=1
n s=k
(15)
Ni,j =
Zj
k=1 s=k (Ck,s /Zs )
For a given p–c matrix and a given pool (of possibly variable size over time) N i,j is just Ni,j multiplied by a
normalizing factor.
We note that normalizing with respect to a pool may be combined with an AV-transformation, leaving the details to
the reader.
7. Other types of p–c matrices
A. Instead of the matrix C, where Ci,j denotes the total number of citations received in the year j by articles published
in a particular journal in the year i, one may also use the simpler matrix T, where Ti,j denotes the total number of
articles published in this journal in the year i and cited in the year j (ignoring the precise number of citations each
article received, hence Ti,j is equal to Pi minus the number of articles that are uncited in the year j).
B. Besides a ‘cited’ perspective, it is also interesting to consider a ‘citing behaviour’, i.e. a given references perspective.
In this case the meaning of the p–c matrices changes considerably. Consider again Table 1, now interval I2 refers
to the period before interval I1 . So, if I1 refers to year Y, then I2 refers to year Y − 1, and in general Ik refers to
year Y − k + 1. In the citing (or referencing) case the symbol Ci,j denotes the number of citations given in articles
published in period Ii to articles published in period Ij .
8. p–c matrices with discrete steps
In the p–c matrices studied thus far rows and columns reflect time periods. Yet, in some studies it is also meaningful
to organize the p–c matrix by discrete steps, more concretely: each row and column refers to exactly one article or one
journal issue, presented in the order in which they are written or published. This approach is especially interesting in
self-citation studies, see e.g. (Glänzel, Thijs, & Schlemmer, 2004). We consider the two examples of (1) all articles
published by one scientist, and (2) the different issues of one particular journal. In the first example Pi refers to one
specific article (hence Pi is always 1) or the number of articles published in journal issue i. In the case of articles
published by one scientist the symbol Ci,j is either zero or one: one if article i is cited by article j (j > i), zero if article i
is not cited by article j. In the case of journal issues the symbol Ci,j denotes the number of self-citations issue i receives
from issue j (j > i). All transformations and invariants considered for a basic p–c matrix can be applied, with a slightly
different meaning, to these discrete step p–c matrices.
9. Discussion and conclusion
The use of basic publication–citation matrices for the construction of informetric indicators has been highlighted.
Transforming these publication–citation matrices clarifies the construction of other indicators. Examples of such transformations, such as the R and the AV-transformation are presented. A distinction has been made between transformations
using only elements of the given p–c matrix, and transformations using external elements, e.g. the size of the citation
pool.
In the spirit of Klein’s Erlangen program (1872) we introduced invariants of transformations of the
publication–citation matrix. We think that informetrics as the mathematical study of information objects may benefit by the introduction of some of the ideas of the Erlangen program. Invariants offer a mathematically founded way
of comparing informetric matrices before and after a transformation. For this reason, we think that invariants and the
study of invariants should receive more attention in theoretical informetrics.

We are convinced that similar transformations, properties and invariants can be studied for other matrices used in
informetric studies, e.g. collaboration matrices or more generally all types of co-occurrence studies.
