Automated Romberg Testing in Patients With Benign
Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo and Healthy Subjects

Abstract—Objective: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo
(BPPV) is the most common cause of dizziness. The underlying
pathomechanism responsible for the recurrent vertigo attacks has
been elucidated in detail and highly effective treatment strategies
(liberation maneuvers) have been developed. However, many BPPV
patients complain about problems of balance especially following
liberation maneuvers. Aim: To objectively demonstrate differences
in balance performance in BPPV patients compared to healthy
subjects both prior and after BPPV liberation maneuvers. Methods: Seven patients with BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal
and nine healthy subjects participated. To assess balance while
standing, we analyzed the location and temporal stability of the
center of pressure recorded by pressure-sensitive electronic soles
during Romberg testing (on stable ground and on foam) and tandem stand. To assess regularity of gait, we analyzed the step frequency during walking of 50 m. All tests were performed prior and
after liberation maneuvers in both groups. Results: Healthy subjects and patients differ significantly in their balance performance
and use different stabilization strategies both prior and after liberation maneuvers. Both Romberg tests indicated poorer balance
in BPPV patients (mean COP shifted towards toes), especially in
posttreatment tests, while tandem stand appeared unaltered. We
did not observe differences in escorted (by an experimenter) walking regularities between patients and healthy subjects and between
pre- and post-maneuver testing. Conclusion and significance: Our
findings confirm the typical clinical observation of a further posttreatment deterioration of already impaired postural performance
in BPPV patients. While the etiology and the time course of this
peculiar problem warrants further studies, the treating physician
should be familiar with this transient side effect of therapeutic
maneuvers to provide adequate counseling of patients. Finally, we
successfully demonstrated the pressure-sensitive electronic soles
as a new and potentially useful tool for both clinical and research
purposes.
Index Terms—Balance, bipedal performance, BPPV, center of
pressure, COP, embedded, sensors.

I. INTRODUCTION
HE probability that a person experiences benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) at least once during his
lifetime is 2.4% [1]. BPPV is by far the most common neurootological disorder [2]–[7]. While the signs and symptoms of
BPPV (vertigo, disorientation, and autonomic disturbances) can

be wearing, the prognosis is excellent: 80–90% of the patients
do not show signs of BPPV after the first treatment; close to
100% are free of symptoms after the third. Often, BPPV also
resolves spontaneously [8]. BPPV is caused by detached calcium carbonate crystals that float freely in the endolymph of the
vestibular labyrinth (see Fig. 1). Normally, these crystals are attached to the otolithic membrane, where they enable the sensing
of linear acceleration including gravity. If, on the affected side,
the free-floating crystals happen to enter one or more of the
three semicircular canals, this so-called canalolithiasis causes
BPPV whenever patients re-orient their heads relative to gravity. Since the specific weight of the crystals exceeds the specific
weight of the endolymph, the crystals always sediment to the
lowest point of the affected semicircular canal, thereby causing
a temporary deflection of its cupula. This effect, in turn, leads
to a transient change of the firing rate in the respective vestibular neurons and consequently to nystagmus and vertigo [9].
Canalolithiasis, and therefore BPPV, is best diagnosed by the
Hallpike maneuver (for the posterior semicircular canals) [10]
or the supine roll maneuver (for the lateral semicircular canals)
[11], [12]. The direction of the positional nystagmus elicited
by these maneuvers (Hallpike: geotropic vertical-torsional positional nystagmus; supine roll: geotropic or apogeotropic horizontal positional nystagmus) allows determining which of the
three semicircular canals is affected by canalolithiasis on either side. Apart from positional vertigo, patients often report
various degrees of unsteadiness during standing and walking,
which is probably due to the abnormal vestibular signals from
the affected semicircular canals. Canalolithiasis is a benign condition, as it can be treated by so-called liberation maneuvers that
have a very high success rate (up to 80–90% of a single maneuver [13]). Rarely, patients need repetitive maneuvers, which
are usually performed at intervals of a few days [14]. The liberation maneuvers for the most common form of BPPV, i.e., the
canalolithiasis of a posterior semicircular canal, are the Epley
[15] (see Fig. 3) and the Semont [16] maneuvers. After liberation maneuvers, despite their effectiveness, patients commonly
experience a transient unsteadiness [17]. This feeling of decreased stability while standing and walking may last for hours,
sometimes up to several days. To the best of our knowledge, it
has never been assessed, whether this postliberation-maneuver
symptom reflects genuine imbalance. The aim of this study,
therefore, was to objectively quantify postural balance immediately after liberation maneuvers and compare it to measurements
performed before the maneuvers. We asked the following questions:
1) Are bipedal performances of BPPV patients significantly
impaired as a result of canalolithiasis?

2) Do canalolith liberation maneuvers lead to measurable
deteriorations of bipedal performances of BPPV patients?
We hypothesized that in patients with BPPV, liberation
maneuvers would move the crystals out of the affected
canal back to the utricle where they would sediment upon
the utricular macula and potentially disturb gravity perception and hence postural stability [17].
3) Do liberation maneuvers also lead to a transient deterioration of bipedal performances in healthy human subjects
and, if present, are they different from those in BPPV
patients?
We formulate these questions in three hypotheses:
H1: Bipedal performance in BPPV patients are statistically
significantly different to performance in healthy subjects.
H2: Bipedal performance deteriorates in BPPV patients as a
result to canalolith liberation maneuvers.
H3: Liberation maneuvers do not have a statistically significant effect on bipedal performance in healthy subjects.
Assessing bipedal performance, i.e., parameters of standing and walking, is not a trivial task. Studies so far used
force-sensitive platforms (by, e.g., Kistler, AMTI etc.), treadmills equipped with a force-sensitive belt (e.g., Zebris), forcesensitive surfaces (by, e.g., GaitRite), or optical motion tracking
(e.g., Vicon). Generally, these systems provide good temporal
and spatial resolution; a major drawback, however, is their stationary setup. These systems have a limited acquisition area
(e.g., GaitRite, Vicon), need to be installed in a dedicated location (e.g., Vicon, Zebris), or require special gear worn by
subjects (e.g., optical markers, Vicon). In contrast to an estimation performed by other systems, we used a self-developed
system that directly measures the force applied to the subjects’
feet soles with more than 1200 pressure-sensitive points. For
this study, the system was integrated in gymnastic shoes of different sizes. A smart phone was used as a remote controller
via a wireless connection. Direct streaming to the smart-phone
was possible but the data were also stored on a local memory
card for later download and offline computational analysis. The
technology and analysis elaborated in this paper can deliver
the required information on the effects of treatments affecting
bipedal performance.

The Romberg test and its variants, which reflect postural control, are most commonly assessed by a medical expert who
scores different aspects of the subject’s performance. While
some parameters are measurable, e.g., time, others allow a qualitative appraisal only. Thus, the degree of imbalance is very
difficult to assess by visual inspection and requires an experienced expert.
Several systems provide objective measures of different features of gait. The GaitRite system is a pressure sensitive carpet.
Depending on the model, the GaitRite system can be up to
10-m long. Subjects are required to walk over the carpet and
the system measures and calculates balance distribution, stance
width, speed etc. The Zebris system consists of a treadmill with
a pressure-sensitive surface. While this system is not limited in
length, the locomotion in place influences the walking style of
subjects [18].
A. Assessments
The study was approved by the local ethical review committee. All subjects were given a small brochure with relevant information on BPPV, the study procedure and sensor setup, possible
risks, privacy, and the freedom to withdraw from participating in
the study at any time without consequences. If subjects agreed
to participate, they were asked to sign the corresponding consent
form.
B. Subjects
Testing was performed on the ward of the Interdisciplinary
Center for Vertigo and Balance Disorders of University Hospital
Zurich. Participants were selected consecutively from the group
of scheduled outpatients seen by a neurologist, whenever the
patients gave a typical history of BPPV due to canalolithiasis.
If, in the course of the protocol, the patients did not show typical positional nystagmus following the provocation maneuvers
at the bedside, they were excluded from the analysis. The data
acquisition protocol did not interfere with diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the clinical appointment was only slightly
prolonged. Healthy control subjects were recruited among the
coworkers of the authors. There was no positional nystagmus
detected in any of the control subjects.
C. Tools
The recording system consisted of two parts: an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a force-sensitive plastic foil with
more than 1200 force-sensitive resistors (see Fig. 2). The IMU
recorded acceleration, rotation rates, and magnetic field readings, each in three dimensions. The force data were structured
in a two-dimensional matrix: X-coordinates (1–20) represented
the transversal dimension (inner side to outer side of the feet), Ycoordinates represented the longitudinal dimension (from heel
to toes). The system was compared in related work to state-ofthe-art systems, e.g., the Zebris Rehawalk system (see [19]). A
sensing element covered 5 × 5 mm2 , thus an increment of 1 in
one dimension represented a physical shift of 5 mm in the same

vertigo and nystagmus occurred [see Fig. 3 (b)], by 90 degrees
to the Dix-Hallpike position on the other side [see Fig. 3(c)] and
then by another 90 degrees in the same direction [see Fig. 3(e)].
To enable the latter head rotation, the body was rolled to the
side position. Finally, the patient was brought up to the sitting
position [see Fig. 3(f)]. In all four positions of the Epley maneuver, the head was kept still for at least 30 s or as long as the
nystagmus lasted.

canal.

Stages of the Epley maneuver to liberate the right posterior semicircular

direction. The foil matched the shape of a foot and could be
adapted with a pair of scissors, e.g., to match any shoe size. We
prepared three different size pairs: EU sizes 37, 42, and 46. The
sensor foils were then glued into gymnastic shoes using doublesided adhesive tape. Gymnastic shoes were preferred over the
patients’ personal shoes due to their simplicity (no artificial heel
rise or bendings on the sole) and the tight fitting to the feet.
During all tests, the system recorded IMU data of both feet,
e.g., acceleration, rotation rates, and magnetic field values at
128 Hz. Concurrently, the sensors sampled the force distribution
beneath the subjects’ feet. All data were stored on the SD cards
of the sensors for off-line analysis.
The participants were asked to perform a set of four standardized tests, including variations of the Romberg test [20], before
and after the therapy that consisted of the liberation maneuver.
Participants were first asked to stand still with their eyes closed
and with their feet put side by side for 20 s (test R1). The second
test was similar: participants had to repeat task 1 while standing on a foam mat, as shown in Fig. 7(a) (R2). The third test
consisted of tandem stance on the floor with eyes closed (T).
Finally, all participants were asked to walk straight 50 m at their
personal pace along the corridor (W). In-between two blocks
of the four tests, the liberation maneuver was applied. With the
Epley maneuver (see Fig. 3) free floating crystals were repositioned into the utricle. In the course of the Epley maneuver,
the head was rotated from the Dix-Hallpike position, in which

All participants were first required to read the information
sheet describing the condition of having BPPV. This document
summarized in lay language the causes and symptoms of BPPV
and the therapeutic procedure. Additionally, the document also
described the sensor technology and to what extend the subjects’
participation in the study would impact the clinical appointment,
e.g., the slightly longer duration. Participants were informed that
the Epley maneuver does not have any persistent or major side
effects.
We asked the participants about their shoe size and provided
them with the best-fitting pair of gymnastic shoes. The first
experimental block consisted of the four tests described in a
previous section, while data were recorded by the sensor system. The tests Romberg (R1), Romberg on foam (R2), tandem
stance (T), and walking lasted 3 min on average. Therapeutic
maneuvers were performed immediately thereafter. BPPV patients were treated with the Epley maneuver on the side of the
posterior canalolithiasis. Healthy subjects were also exposed to
Epley maneuvers, first on the left, then on the right side. The
maneuvers were always performed by the same neurologist. In
patients, the Dix-Hallpike provocation maneuver was repeated
after the Epley maneuver to detect a possible persistence of the
positional nystagmus. If positional nystagmus was still present,
the Epley maneuver was repeated until subsequent Dix-Hallpike
maneuvers revealed absence of positional nystagmus.
After successful Epley maneuvers, the three balance tests
and the walking test were repeated. Then, the sensor system
was switched OFF and the participants took the gymnastic
shoes off.
E. Analysis
Analysis was based on both the pressure data and the
inertial data.
First, intervals in the data stream were appropriately labeled
and extracted for each subject, i.e., the tests Romberg, Romberg
on foam, tandem, and walking before and after the liberation
maneuvers. In Fig. 4, IMU acceleration data are visualized for
the three spatial dimensions. Since a subject was required to
stand still during Romberg testing (first three tests), the acceleration data did not modulate substantially. Subjects needed to
take some steps from ground to the foam mat etc. Thus, these
transitions were easily detectable in the data stream. We manually selected the intervals for the individual tests and ensured
that only relevant periods were included and no data of a subject
moving his/her feet (e.g., in the transition phases).

in Fig. 6.

To address the issue of different shoe sizes of tested subjects, we normalized all datasets to the data size of 20 × 60
by linear interpolation. We calculated center-of-pressure (COP)
coordinates for all four tests. Additionally, for the walking test,
the system automatically extracted the timestamps when the
feet made contact to the ground. Two consecutive timestamps
defined a step cycle, i.e., stride-to-stride. We did not consider
higher level features such as stance, swing, toe-off, and other
phases of gait.
In Fig. 6, different frames during a stance phase are shown
for a typical subject. Contact to ground usually started at the
heel [see Fig. 6(a)] and continued until the entire foot touched
the ground [see Fig. 6(b)]. Later, the heel lifted off the floor [see
Fig. 6(c)], until, finally, the entire foot was lifted off the floor.
We did not impose a specific orientation of the IMU sensor
relative to a subject’s shin: It was attached in an arbitrary angle
and, therefore, sensed acceleration along every dimension with
an unknown percentage of the total acceleration. We, therefore,

calculated accelerometer magnitude and used this signal for
step detection (red curve in Fig. 5). The peaks of magnitude
marked with red circles are impact points, i.e., the timestamps
when a foot made contact to the ground. Blue circles are toeoff events, i.e., the event when the foot left the ground entirely
and thus, the signal from the pressure sensor became irrelevant.
COP data and gait data were further analyzed with a movingwindow approach. We used 300 ms windows with 50% overlap.
Similar approaches used smaller window sizes (170 ms), which
resulted in false positives on our data [21]. A 300-ms-wide
window resulted in no false positives. In every window, we
computed the parameters listed in Table I.
We performed repeated two-factor analysis of variance,
ANOVA (α = 0.05, factors = [Group{BPPV, Control},
Condition{pre-, post-therapy}]), to test our hypotheses and to
derive the relevant parameters. Regarding the analysis for hypothesis H2, we trained and tested the supervised classifiers
support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNN),

III. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION
A. Participants and Data Acquisition
We tested seven patients (2 Males, 5 Females) and nine
healthy human subjects (Males: 6, Females: 3). The patients’
mean age was 60.57 (±9.03) years and the healthy subjects’
mean age was 33.5 (±10.6) years. For the assessment of healthy
subjects, we scheduled testing sessions on three different days
within two weeks. Patients’ data were recorded over a period
of three months. Three patients suffered from right-sided posterior canalolithiasis; one patient suffered from left-sided posterior canalolithiasis; one patient suffered from bilateral posterior
canalolithiasis; one patient suffered from left-sided posterior
and horizontal canalolithiasis; one patient suffered from rightsided posterior canalolithiasis and horizontal cupulolithiasis. In
two patients, the sensor system only recorded the data of the
posttherapy tests for one foot correctly.
Every healthy subject was recorded once before and once after
liberation maneuvers; one healthy subject was required to redo
the test because the sensor system became nonoperational due
to low-battery power. All patients, except for one, required only

one liberation maneuver for successful treatment. One subject
suffered from recurrence of BPPV symptoms and was liberated
four times. In this patient, to avoid subject-caused bias, we
included only data from the first therapy session in our analysis.
Several subjects (patients and healthy) lost balance within
the 20 s of the tandem tests, T. These events were visible in the
accelerometer data and were manually removed such that only
stable periods were included for further analysis. However, to
avoid learning effects (see [22]), we did not repeat the test in
these situations.
B. Data Analysis
For tests R1 and R2 (Romberg), the major COP instabilities appeared mainly in the forward/backward direction (Ycoordinate), while for T (tandem), the instabilities occurred in
the left/right direction (X-coordinate). We used the coefficient of
variation, CV, (σ/μ) to estimate the instabilities. CV is a measure of the dispersion of a set of coordinates. Table II provides
the results of an analysis on the data from healthy subjects.
Analysis of data from patients created similar results. Thus,
for tests R1 and R2, we further analyzed the Y-dimension of
the pressure sensor (coordinate range 1–60) and for the test
T, the X-dimension (range 1–20). In the tables below, the features were calculated on coordinates of the pressure insole (see
Section II-C).
In the following, we address our hypotheses and present the
corresponding results.

The first hypothesis, H1, holds that patients and healthy subjects differ significantly in their balance performances prior
to any therapy. The Romberg test is a well-known surrogate
for bipedal standing performance. We compared patients and
healthy subjects during the classical Romberg test (standing
with feet together and eyes closed, R1) and its more difficult
variations in which subjects are required to stand on a piece of
foam [R2, see Fig. 7(a)] or on even ground in tandem stance
[T, see Fig. 7(b)]. Results of the statistical analysis of all features are listed in Table III. Note the different ranges of values
(e.g., insole coordinates) between tests. As we explained above,
for R1 and R2, the range of possible values was [1–60], and
for test T, the coordinates fell within the interval [1–20]. The
tables list average values on COP coordinates for all tests R1,
R2, T, and features (cf., Section II-C). In Table III, the first
number represents data from healthy subjects and the second
number represents data from patients. Each row contains data
for a specific test, e.g., data for R1 are in row 1.
H1 could not be rejected statistically, i.e., there were significant differences of performance between healthy subjects
and patients. The mean values and the median values of the
COP were significantly lower in healthy subjects than in patients. Thus, healthy subjects kept their COP closer to the heels
than patients. The feature variance did not reveal significant
difference between patients and healthy subjects. Interestingly,
performance in T, the tandem-stance test, was similar in patients
and in healthy subjects: There were no statistically significant
differences between the two groups prior to therapy. Whether
the small statistically significant differences for R1 and R2 are
clinically relevant needs to be addressed in subsequent studies.
Hypothesis H2 could not be rejected statistically as well (see
Table IV), i.e., the Epley maneuver affected the patient group.
Test performances after therapy were significantly different to
performances assessed before the intervention. As a reaction to
treatment, patients shifted the mean and median COP significantly closer to the toes. After therapy, mean COP values were
approximately 1.5 coordinate counts ( 7.5 mm) closer to the

toes in R1 and R2. The median shifted similarly. Variance of
COP was not affected significantly. Interestingly, there was no
noticeable adaption of patients in the tandem test, T. Patients
applied a different postural strategy after the Epley maneuver in
R1 and R2 than after T.
Hypothesis H3 holds that the therapy should not have statistically significant effects on healthy subjects. H3 was rejected
statistically (see Table V). For R1, healthy subjects showed no
significant reaction to the Epley maneuver. However, surprisingly, healthy subjects showed a statistically significant reaction to both R2 and T. In R2, healthy subjects shifted the mean
and median COP slightly towards the heels (∼ 0.7 coordinates
 3 mm). Whether this small, but significant difference is clinically relevant, should be addressed in subsequent studies. A
stronger reaction to the Epley maneuver was seen in tandem
test T. Data suggested that healthy subjects tried to stabilize the
tandem stance by shifting the mean and median COP towards
the lateral side of their feet. On average the COP shifted about
1.5 coordinates ( 7.5 mm) towards the lateral side. Fig. 8 visualizes typical examples during the tandem task. In Fig. 8(a), the
mean pressure during T of a healthy subjects is shown, while in
Fig. 8(b), mean data during T in a patient is depicted. The two
images are representative for the statistical evidence presented
above: after the Epley maneuver, for the tandem task, healthy
subjects shift their COP to the lateral side of the feet; patients,
however, did apply different strategy. As discussed above, both
groups showed reactions to the Epley maneuver but both had
different compensation mechanisms. Healthy subjects shifted
their COP in the backward direction, while patients shifted it
forward toward the toes. Further, the range of COP coordinates
(range = [min, max]; see Table VI) in healthy subjects changed
not significantly after the Epley maneuver, whereas in patients,
the sway increased significantly for both tests. Overall, patients
showed a stronger reaction to the therapy than healthy subjects.
We trained supervised and unsupervised classifiers on patient
and healthy-subject data. The task was to discriminate between
before-therapy and after-therapy performance for each group.
Table VII shows the performance of the classifiers on healthy
subject data. For R1, SVM showed the best performance with
89% correct classification. For R2 and T, the kNN classifier
outperformed all other classifiers. On the data of patients, kNN
outperformed all other classifiers with an average correct classification rate of 88%. Table VIII shows the results.
We formulated another classification tasks: We aimed to
investigate the performance of the best classifier to separate
healthy subjects from patients. Data of before and after the

CHANGES IN THE RANGE OF COP DATA IN HEALTHY (SUBSCRIPT H) AND
PATIENTS (SUBSCRIPT P)

Analysis of the timestamps during the walking task did not
reveal any significant differences between healthy subjects and
patients. This did not match our expectations since imbalance
could result in changes of walking speed (see [23], [24]). We
assume, however, that the discrepancy between these data and
our expectations maybe caused by the way we assessed walking
speed. In order to be able to prevent a subject from falling, one
of the authors (R.A.) was walking close to the subjects. We
believe that the subjects subconsciously adapted their walking
speed to match the speed of the experimenter, even though we
asked them to walk at a fast but freely chosen speed. We will
address this in future studies.

therapy for both groups were used by the algorithms. Table IX
shows the results of the classifiers. For R1, SVM performed
slightly better than the other classifiers. However, for R2 and
T, kNN showed a better performance. With a mean accuracy of
approximately 80% kNN outperformed the other classifiers.

In this paper, we introduced a system for automated Romberg
testing and demonstrated its feasibility with an investigation
on the effects of a treatment for BPPV. In prior work, it has
been reported that patients suffered a temporary exacerbation
of their subjective postural imbalance following an Epley maneuver [17], [25], [26]. So far, this effect was not further investigated. In this paper, we investigated three hypotheses. We
could not reject statistically the first hypothesis, H1: patients
with BPPV and healthy subjects differ significantly in their
bipedal performance. We also could not reject statistically H2:
the Epley maneuver provoked a measurable and statistically
significant change of bipedal-performance features in patients.
However, we could reject H3 statistically: the Epley maneuver
also had a statistically significant effect on bipedal performance
in healthy people. We used a sensor system measuring inertial
data and force applied to the feet in order to assess the bipedal
performance of the subjects. We recorded data from seven patients and nine healthy subjects. Inertial data and force data were
statistically analyzed and classifiers were trained.
Patients differed significantly from healthy subjects, i.e., the
impact of BPPV was measurable. The Epley maneuver affected the bipedal performance of patients. However, there was,

unexpectedly, a statistically significant difference between the
performance of healthy subjects before and after the Epley maneuver. The control subjects adapted a different stabilization
strategy than patients, however.
One limitation of this study was the significant age difference
between patients and control subjects. The age differences could
have introduced differences in pretreatment postural values and
differences in response to liberation maneuvers.
Based on our findings, we plan future studies addressing these
effects. As we introduced in the motivation, it could be helpful
if the severity of BPPV, the efficacy of the treatment, and other
therapy related parameters could be estimated by an automated
system. Such a system possibly could assist as a diagnosis tool
for better matching a therapy schedule to individual needs of
individual patients. The duration of treatment could be reduced
and the overall efficacy of treatments could be increased.
