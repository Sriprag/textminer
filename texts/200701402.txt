Abstract
Under the National Innovation System (NIS) framework, knowledge stock has been recognized as a key factor for enhancing
national innovative capabilities. However, despite the importance of patents and papers for measuring knowledge, previous research
has not fully utilized patent and paper databases, and has instead relied on research and development (R&D) data. Therefore, in
this research, I introduce a way to utilize both types of useful data when measuring industrial knowledge stocks. As primary data
sources, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) Web site for patents and the science citation index (SCI) for papers
are used. In the case of Korea, the amount of knowledge stock proxied by patents and papers is different from that proxied by R&D,
which indicates in turn that using a single indicator such as R&D may be misleading. Although the result may vary depending on
the selected nation, the proposed method will be useful for gauging knowledge stocks in a more complementary way.

1. Introduction
Under the framework of the National Innovation System (NIS), the concept of knowledge stock has been emphasized
because in order to create more sophisticated knowledge, accumulated knowledge is considered more important than
the one-time input of a large volume of knowledge (Metcalfe & Ramlogan, 2005; OECD, 1996). Therefore, many
researchers have strived to measure knowledge stock by using R&D data (Griliches, 1979; Mansfield, 1980; Scherer,
1982). However, R&D data have its limitations in that it only represents the input-side of knowledge, thereby making
us overvalue the stocks of knowledge (Kleinknecht, Van Montfort, & Brouwer, 2002; Lach, 1995; Park & Park, 2006).
Thus, in order to cope with the shortcomings of R&D data, patents and papers, which indicate the output-side of
knowledge, have been adopted recently in shaping science and technology (S&T) policies (Archibugi & Pianta, 1996;
Moon & Lee, 2005; Okubo, 1997). However, their usage has been limited to a certain technology or scientific discipline,
not incorporating the issues relating to industrial policies within a nation.
An industry, as a unit of analysis, is important since it shares a common knowledge ground in terms of technological
development and production, and acts as a critical element in the NIS. Therefore, Pavitt (1984), Breschi and Malerba
(1997), and Marlerba (2002) focused on elaborating the peculiar patterns of industries and emphasized an industry as
the primary unit for analyzing important innovations.
However, despite the aforementioned potential usefulness of patents and papers for measuring knowledge stocks at
the industry level, there has not been any sufficient effort to utilize patents and papers so far, for the purpose mentioned.

Therefore, in this research, I introduce a way to use patents and papers for measuring industrial knowledge stocks.
In addition, I will present the case of Korea for the period of 1994–2000 when the knowledge stocks significantly
increased, as an illustration.
2. Two knowledge measures
2.1. Usefulness of patents
Due to the importance of knowledge, international economic organizations such as the OECD have made great
efforts to suggest measures for knowledge through large-scale workshops.1 Among others, patents nowadays have
drawn great attention and have become the focus of discussion due to their representativeness and comprehensiveness
as a knowledge indicator. Earlier, Archibugi and Pianta (1996) elaborated the advantages and disadvantages of patents
when they are used in policy making. The main advantages of patents are as follows: (i) they are the direct outcome
of inventions with the aim of being used commercially; (ii) they not only harbor information on the rate of inventive
activities but also that of their development directions; (iii) they contain large volumes of information related to
inventors, descriptions, patent classes, claims, and diagrams of technological outputs; (iv) they are easily accessible.
On the other hand, there exist disadvantages such as the following: (i) not all inventions are patented; (ii) patent
propensity is different across firms and sectors; (iii) the classification scheme of patents does not correspond to that of
economic fields; (iv) each country has its own different patent system.
2.2. Usefulness of papers
The importance of papers is more directly emphasized because compared with patents, they seem to pursue the
accumulation of fundamental knowledge which, in turn, may not be directly applied to industrial use. However,
Rosenberg and Nelson (1994) and Nelson and Rosenberg (1998) explicitly pointed out the importance of scientific
knowledge for industrial development. Therefore, in order to examine the knowledge stocks within the NIS, we should
incorporate scientific knowledge. Like patents, scientific papers have their merits and demerits. The merits include
the following: (i) scientific papers are the only media that show scientific achievements (Wouters, 1998); (ii) citation
patterns can be a useful tool for examining the knowledge exchange among scientists as well as the interdependencies
of disciplines (Small & Garfield, 1985). In contrast, the demerits are summarized as follows: (i) the propensity to
publish is different depending on the field (Hicks & Katz, 1996; Meyer, 2002); (ii) papers not written in English are
often disregarded (Meyer, 2002).
3. Measuring knowledge stocks
The stock in “knowledge stock” is a concept which is equivalent to that in “capital stock” in economics. That is,
knowledge stock at a certain point is composed of four distinctive parts—the knowledge input at a certain point, the
knowledge stock from the previous period, the depreciation rate, and the time-lag caused by the gestation period.
Therefore, we can obtain the knowledge stock of industry i at time t as follows:
KSit = KIi(t−m) + (1 − δit )KSi(t−1)

(1)

where KS is the knowledge stock, KI the knowledge input, δ the depreciation rate, m the time lag, i the industry, and t
is the time.
Then since the knowledge stock of time point t − 1 can be expressed as the sum of the knowledge inputs from the
base point to t − 1, we can get the following equation:
KSit = KIi(t−m) + (1 − δit )KIi(t−m−1) + (1 − δit )(1 − δi(t−1) )KIi(t−m−2)
+· · · + (1 − δit )· · ·(1 − δi(t−b) )KIi(b−m)

inventions (Madrid on 18–19 May 2006); and so on.

271

where KS is the knowledge stock, KI the knowledge input, δ the depreciation rate, m the time lag, i the industry, t the
time, and b is the base point.
If we assume that the depreciation rates of each point are the same, then we can transform Eq. (2) into (3) as follows:
KSit = KIi(t−m) + (1 − δi )KIi(t−m−1) + (1 − δi )2 KIi(t−m−2) + · · · + (1 − δi )b KIi(b−m)

(3)

where KS is the knowledge stock, KI the knowledge input, δ the depreciation rate, m the time lag, i the industry, t the
time, and b is the base point.
Subsequently, if we consider that the knowledge stock at the base point can be obtained from the cumulative forms
of the knowledge inputs from the zero time point, and the knowledge inputs are increased by the constant growth rate
across all periods, then we can get the knowledge input at the base point as follows:
KIi(b−m) = KIi0 (1 + gi )(b−m−1)

(4)

where KI is the knowledge input, g the average growth rate, m the time lag, i the industry, and b is the base point.
Therefore, as noted in Eq. (2), the knowledge stock at the base point can also be earned as follows:
KSib = KIi(b−m) + (1 − δi )KIi(b−m−1) + · · · + (1 − δi )(b−m−1) KIi0

(5)

where KS is the knowledge stock, KI the knowledge input, δ the depreciation rate, m the time lag, i the industry, t the
time, and b is the base point.
As noted in Eq. (4), since the knowledge inputs across all time points can be expressed by using the knowledge
input at the zero time point and the growth rate, Eq. (5) can be transformed as follows:
KSib = KIi0 (1 + gi )(b−m−1) + (1 − δi )KIi0 (1 + gi )(b−m−2) + · · · + (1 − δi )(b−m−1) KIi0

(6)

where KS is the knowledge stock, KI the knowledge input, δ the depreciation rate, m the time lag, i the industry, t the
time, and b is the base point.
Finally, if we organize the right side of Eq. (6), then we can get the knowledge stock at the base point as follows:
KSib =

1 + gi
KIi(b−m)
gi + δ i

(7)

where KS is the knowledge stock, KI the knowledge input, δ the depreciation rate, m the time lag, i the industry, t the
time, and b is the base point.
Using Eqs. (1) and (7), we can calculate the amount of knowledge stock in each industry. Since I proposed the use
of patents and papers for the proxy measures for knowledge, we can measure knowledge stocks at the industrial level
by replacing KI with patent counts and paper counts.
4. The Korean case
4.1. Data collection and manipulation
4.1.1. Patents
As mentioned above, since every country has its own different patent system, we need to select one country’s patent
data in order to avoid home country bias (Criscuolo, 2006). In this study, I selected US patents since their values are the
highest (Criscuolo, 2006; Watabane, Tsuji, & Griefy-Brown, 2001). Therefore, I collected data from the USPTO Web
site. The fields needed were the Assignee Country, Issue Date, Patent Number, and Current US Classification. Since
Korea is an exemplary case here, I only gathered the patents issued by Korean assignees for the period of 1994–2000.
In particular, I searched for the patents corresponding to the reference country and period by using the query statement
ACN/KR AND ISD/19940101 → 20001231. Consequently, 15,541 patents were retrieved as shown in Table 1. Then by
referring to Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg’s (2001) sub-categories,2 I re-matched the classes into six important industries
for the Korean economy, namely, the chemical, machinery, and transportation industries – traditional sectors – and
2

Hall et al. (2001) matched technological classification to industrial categorization.

the IT information technology (IT), biotechnology (BT), and nanotechnology (NT) industries—emerging sectors. The
matching results are shown in Appendix 1.
4.1.2. Papers
As for the proxy for scientific knowledge, I used the SCI database provided by the ISI. It has limitations in that
most of the achievements were written in English and may therefore not accommodate those shown in other languages.
However, since the SCI holds the most renowned journals that scientists wish to publish their works in, it can be used as
a source to represent scientific knowledge. In addition, the SCI recently provided bibliographic data through their Web
site, which is called the Web of science (WoS), thereby allowing us to have access to the most recent information. The
fields needed were the address, publication year, article number, and source title. As mentioned above, I only gathered
the papers published by Korean authors for the period of 1994–2000. That is, I searched for the papers corresponding to
the reference country and period by using search words like “Korea” in the address field and “1994, 1995, 1996, 1997,
1998, 1999, and 2000” in the publication year field. Consequently, 69,396 papers were retrieved as shown in Table 2.
Afterward, since the SCI covers over 6000 journals, we had to re-categorize them into the industries of our interests.
Therefore, by referring to the subject categories3 by which the ISI classified the numerous journals depending on their
academic disciplines, I converted each paper into the six industries listed above. The matching results are shown in
Appendix 2.
4.2. Measuring
First, as mentioned above, knowledge stock is calculated by substituting KI of Eq. (1) with patents and papers. Then
we delete the time-lag term as shown by Lach (1995). With regard to the depreciation rate, Lach (1995) used 0.15,

The ISI provides the scope notes for each subject category on the Web (http://scientific.thomson.com/mjl/scope/scope sci.html). By referring to
the explanations on the Web page, we matched the scientific fields to the corresponding industries.

while Park and Park (2006) employed different ratios across sectors. Since the depreciation rate varies depending on
the measurement method, we use 0.13 which is the depreciation rate used for most industries in the study of Park and
Park (2006).
As a result, Fig. 1 shows industrial knowledge stock measured with patents and papers, respectively. It is very clear
that when using patents, the knowledge stock in the IT industry is strikingly immense, while those in other industries
are not very visible. On the other hand, when using papers, the distribution of the knowledge stocks is more dispersed
across industries. In addition, the knowledge stocks in the chemical and BT industries are more than the knowledge
stock in the IT industry. Moreover, since the industrial structure has become more high technology-oriented since 1999,
the BT industry has taken the lead in the chemical industry.
Fig. 2 shows industrial knowledge stock measured with R&D, the left of which is measured with R&D expenditure, and the right of which is gauged based on R&D personnel.4 The patterns of the two graphs are analogous,
except that we can see that there is more knowledge stock for the Transportation industry when using R&D expenditure as a proxy. However, the trend markedly varies as compared to the cases of patents and papers. Therefore,
these results indicate that providing an explanation of knowledge stocks by simply considering R&D data may be
misleading.
5. Discussion
Above, I compared the knowledge stocks proxied by simple patent and paper counts with those measured with
R&D expenditure and personnel. However, although simple patent and paper counts represent the knowledge stocks
4

R&D expenditure and R&D personnel are the most widely used R&D data when measuring knowledge (OECD, 1996).

within a country in a broad sense, citation-weighted patent and paper counts have been recently known to reflect
knowledge stocks better (Abdih & Joutz, 2006). Therefore, after collecting citation data from the USPTO Web site
and SCI database, I re-calculated the knowledge stocks as follows:
NCit
CKSit = 6
KSit
i=1 NCit

(8)

where CKS is the citation-weighted knowledge stock, NC the number of citations, KS the knowledge stock, i the
industry, and t the time.
Fig. 3 shows the citation-weighted knowledge stocks at an industrial level for the same reference period. As a result,
it was found that Korea had accumulated the most knowledge stock in the IT industry when knowledge stock was
measured with patents, and in the BT and chemical industries when such was gauged with papers. Also, the amount
of knowledge stock in other industries was evaluated less as compared to the case in which simple patent and paper
counts were used.

6. Concluding remarks
In this research, I proposed the use of patents and papers for measuring industrial-level knowledge stocks in
order to overcome the shortcomings of R&D data. Moreover, this research is meaningful in that it introduced a
way to collect a large set of patent and paper data. First, in terms of patent data collection, while previous research
made use of secondary database such as the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER),5 I directly collected
necessary data from the USPTO Web site in order to enhance timeliness. Second, with respect to paper data collection, previous research utilized the SCI database for a limited technology or discipline, whereas I comprehensively
gathered data corresponding to one country from the WoS. Finally, despite the importance of scientific achievements in industrial development, there has not been any sufficient effort to link science to industry. However, in this
research, I included the ISI subject categories as the criteria through which we can group scientific disciplines into
industries.
In the case of Korea, it has been found that the amounts of knowledge stock at the industrial level differ depending on the proxy measures for knowledge. Therefore, this indicates that we should not consider only one indicator
such as R&D. Furthermore, it should be noted that the amounts of knowledge stock across industries may vary
from nation to nation due to idiosyncratic national S&T policies and industry specialization. However, the proposed method will enable S&T policy makers to measure industrial knowledge stocks in a more complementary
way.
