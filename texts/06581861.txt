Reconstructing Total Knee Motion

Abstract—Comprehending knee motion is an essential requirement for studying the causes of knee disorders. In this paper,
we propose a new 2-D–3-D registration system based on jointconstraint model for reconstructing total knee motion. The proposed model that contains bone geometries and an articulated joint
mechanism is first constructed from multipostural magnetic resonancevolumetric images. Then, the bone segments of the model are
hierarchically registered to each frame of the given single-plane
fluoroscopic video that records the knee activity. The bone posture
is iteratively optimized using a modified chamfer matching algorithm to yield the simulated radiograph which is the best fit to the
underlying fluoroscopic image. Unlike conventional registration
methods computing posture parameters for each bone independently, the proposed femorotibial and patellofemoral joint models properly maintain the articulations between femur, tibia, and
patella during the registration processes. As a result, we can obtain
a sequence of registered knee postures showing smooth and reasonable physiologic patterns of motion. The proposed system also
provides joint-space interpolation to densely generate intermediate
postures for motion animation. The effectiveness of the proposed
method was validated by computer simulation, animal cadaver,
and in vivo knee testing. The mean target registration errors for
femur, tibia, and patella were less than 1.5 mm. In particular, small
out-of-plane registration errors [less than 1 mm (translation) and
2◦ (rotation)] were achieved in animal cadaver assessments.

motion, and unfortunately, long-term usage and injuries tend to
lead to the degeneration of knee joint functions. Moreover, knee
osteoarthritis has been reported as the most common chronic
joint disorder in elderly people, and is a disabling disease with
many individual risk factors that might affect the quality of
life [1]. The correlation of these factors with the structural progression of osteoarthritis has been mostly investigated based
on radiographic evaluations. However, such 2-D analyses may
not be able to provide enough evidences in clinical diagnosis for good outcome of medical intervention [2]. In general,
knee degeneration can be evaluated based on several parameters, e.g., load distribution, contact area, and ligament tension
during knee motion. To measure these parameters and learn better the pathomechanism, reconstructing 3-D knee kinematics is
hence rather important. This paper aims to explore and develop
an image analysis system for noninvasively and automatically
reconstructing total knee motion.
Most previous research has focused on analyzing knee kinematics, primarily derived from data attained through skin markers tracked using a motion capture system. Chen et al. [3] and Lin
et al. [4] utilized a 3-D knee surface model and moving marker
data to simulate and visualize knee motion. Lin et al. [5] employed an optoelectronic marker tracking system to investigate
patella behavior during knee flexion and extension. Although
the use of a motion capture system permits easy collection of
knee motion data, the accuracy of marker tracking may potentially decrease due to the deformation of soft tissues (e.g., skin
movement or muscle contraction), making the reconstructed
knee motion prone to biases [6].
To overcome this drawback, image-based motion analysis
methods have been considered. Over recent years, there has
been a rapid development of noninvasive imaging devices for
visualizing the geometries of human internal structures. For
example, single-plane fluoroscopy can be used to acquire a sequence of projection images that records the posture changes of
imaged object during activity. Computer tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance (MR) scanners mostly provide high-quality
volumetric images for static postures. Although CT imaging can
produce very high-quality images for bony structures, it results
in the irradiation of study volunteers in each acquisition. As to
MR scanning, it can also provide reasonably clear boundaries of
bony structures, and more importantly, is radiation free. Another
potential merit is that it enables the visualization of anatomical details of soft tissues, which is unavailable in CT imaging.
Considering that the knee joint contains both rigid bones and
soft tissues, using MR modality can preserve better extensibility
of the system to include soft tissues, e.g., patella ligament and
anterior cruciate ligament, for investigating more complete knee

motion. Thus, MR and single-plane fluoroscopy were selected
as the image modalities for knee motion reconstruction in this
study.
2-D–3-D image registration is the process of identifying an
optimal 3-D geometric transformation which can sufficiently
match a 3-D object to a specific projection image. In the early
days, Banks et al. [7] and Zuffi et al. [8] proposed using 2-D–3-D
registration to noninvasively measure the dynamic femorotibial
contact of knee implants of patients with total knee arthroplasty.
Their registration systems were designed for the fluoroscopic
images of metallic components, which present a large degree
of homogeneous intensity and sharp boundaries. Nevertheless,
they did not overcome the drawbacks caused by inherent artifacts of X-ray imaging on natural knee joints, e.g., unevenly
distributed intensity in knee bone regions and fuzzy bone boundaries. These drawbacks make it difficult to extract the complete
borders of bone segments from fluoroscopic images, thus leading to the instability of feature matching during the registration
process.
Some studies have attempted to improve the fitness measures
of 2-D–3-D registration to better accommodate the drawbacks
of X-ray imaging. Fregly et al. [9] and Tsai et al. [10] proposed using contour-based measures to register knee bone surface models to fluoroscopic images. Penney et al. [11] presented
a validation of intensity- and gradient-based 2-D–3-D registration algorithms. Ma et al. [12] proposed a template matchingbased method with a normalized correlation coefficient for registration of multiple bones. Although these methods achieved
good registration by exploring different image features, they
were unable to handle the insufficiencies occurring in spatial
information in single-plane fluoroscopic images. This difficulty
is because slight object translations perpendicular to the projection image plane do not result in obvious changes to the
projection details [13]. The bone registration, which only utilizes image features without taking the articulation of the knee
joint into account, is prone to be trapped by incorrect local solutions, especially in the case of out-of-plane motion (i.e., motion
along the projection direction). More specifically, two articulated bone segments may be dislocated if they are registered
independently; significant differences which violate the joint
constraint may appear in the registration results.
Although it has been reported that patellofemoral pain syndrome (e.g., runner’s knee) is a common musculoskeletal condition in young people [14], [15], existing 2-D–3-D registration
systems for natural knees mainly have addressed the issue of
reconstructing the kinematics of the femur and tibia. Only rare
studies have developed image-based approaches for reconstructing patella motion [16]. The patella has a smooth shape and is
relatively small as compared to the femur and tibia, so accountable image and shape features for 2-D–3-D registration are very
limited. Again, without incorporating additional domain knowledge such as knee anatomy and biomechanics, accurate registration for the total knee (femur, tibia, fibula, and patella) is hard
to achieve.
Beyond that, there is another unresolved issue in reconstructing total knee motion (i.e., femur, tibia, fibula, and patella).
The knee bone segments can afford a wide range of motion, so

large postural differences between a 3-D knee model and 2-D
fluoroscopic images are very like to occur. It is difficult to automatically place each bone segment of the knee model close
to the corresponding position on each image. Therefore, manually initializing proper knee posture remains the most common
method by which to do this [9], but it is, however, tedious,
time-consuming, and operator-dependent.
In our previous study, we proposed using an articulated hand
model to segment hand bones from multipostural MR images
[17]. It was found that using an anatomical model with proper
kinematic properties and image features can efficiently resolve
the variations among the contents of different images as well
as those occurring in conjunction with object motion. Adding
to this, in this paper, we propose a new model-based image
registration system for reconstructing total knee motion. For
each subject, given the multipostural MR images to construct a
knee model, the proposed method can automatically reconstruct
his/her knee motion using the proposed registration method with
single-plane fluoroscopy.
Major improvements involved in the proposed method, as
compared to conventional methods, are described next. The proposed knee model, characterized by an articulated joint mechanism intended to constrain knee motion, can compensate for the
insufficiency of spatial information in single-plane fluoroscopic
images. Moreover, the proposed method can automatically drive
each bone of the knee joint to a good initial condition for facilitating convergence of registration as well as for reducing
the time cost of manual adjustments. We also design a noncorresponding point removal scheme to achieve better matching
between 2-D and 3-D image features. More importantly, the
proposed joint-constraint model covers both femorotibial and
patellofemoral joints, thus enabling investigation of total knee
motion. Overall, our proposed method can cope with the aforementioned difficulties in 2-D–3-D knee image registration. This
paper is arranged as follows. Section II gives the details of the
proposed method, Sections III and IV describes the experimental results and discussions, respectively, and the final section
provides the conclusion.
II. METHOD
A. Overview of the Proposed System
To reconstruct 3-D knee motion using single-plane fluoroscopy, we first require the derivations of the projection parameters of fluoroscopy. Then, a knee model consisting of bone geometries and an articulated joint mechanism is constructed from
multipostural MR images. We then apply the projection parameters and knee model to the model-based registration stage. The
bone segments of the knee model are hierarchically registered to
the fluoroscopic images, which record the knee postural changes
during the activity. The registration of each bone segment is
achieved by adjusting the motion parameters with respect to the
joint-constraint model, making a simulated radiograph (SR) of
the bone segment best matched to the underlying fluoroscopic
image. Consequently, the registered knee postures in the entire
fluoroscopic image sequence serve as the reconstruction result
of 3-D knee motion.

fluoroscopy was 10 frames/s, and the pixel size was 0.37 mm
× 0.37 mm. On the other hand, to obtain a detailed 3-D knee
structure, we acquired three postural MR images at knee bending degrees of 0, 30, and 60 by using a Philips 1.5 T Achieva
system. The three postural images are denoted as postures 1, 2,
and 3, respectively, and example frames are shown in Fig. 2(b).
The slicing planes for the three postures were the sagittal plane
(slicing thickness: 3 mm; spacing between slices: 1.5 mm). The
imaging protocol we adopted was a 3-D gradient echo sequence
repetition time of 20 ms, an echo time of 7.5 ms, and a flip angle
of 50◦ . The pixel size was 0.3125 mm × 0. 3125 mm.

respectively.

B. Estimation of Projection Parameters of Fluoroscopy
The projection parameters of fluoroscopy, which include both
the principal point and principal istandce, can be used to reconstruct the geometry of an imaging system that is modeled using
perspective viewing projection, as shown in Fig. 1. The principal point (i.e., the origin of the reference coordinate system) is
the point on the image plane where the X-ray is incident perpendicularly, and the principal distance is the distance between
the X-ray source and the principal point. Because X-ray images
usually suffer from geometric distortion artifacts, we first use
a third-order polynomial approximation approach [18] to correct the acquired images. After the image correction, we adopt a
double-plate calibration setting to obtain the values of the principal distance and principal point based on the spatial relationship
between 3-D points and their 2-D projections [7], [19].
C. Image Preparation
Single-plane fluoroscopy was used to record the projection
details of knee motion. In order to acquire the knee fluoroscopic images, the subject was asked to lie on the platform of
the fluoroscopy scanner (Toshiba ADR-1000A) and to flex the
knee at a comfortable speed. The X-ray was emitted along the
medial-lateral direction, and example frames of the acquired fluoroscopic images are shown in Fig. 2(a). The frame rate of video

D. Construction of the Knee Joint-Constraint Model
1) Model Architecture: The knee model used to control the
articulated motion of knee bone segments plays a pivotal role
in the proposed model-based registration. The knee model consists of four bone segments including the femur, tibia, fibula,
and patella, and the volumes of bone segments are extracted
semiautomatically from the MR image of posture 1 using the
livewire approach [20]. The bone surfaces are triangulated using
the marching cube algorithm [21] and then smoothed to remove
local fluctuations.
As the human knee is an articulated structure, which does not
allow the knee bone segments to move individually, we hence
assign the knee model a hierarchical relationship to specify the
order of bone registration and articulated transformation. Since
the relative movement between the tibia and fibula is tiny, they
are grouped as one component. Fig. 3 shows an overview of
the model architecture. The femur on the top layer determines
the global knee motion, while the other two components on
the lower layer are capable of performing relative motion to
the femur. Moreover, the tibia component has more shape features compared to the patella, it would be easier to first register
the tibia with the fluoroscopic image. After the tibia is well
registered, an anatomical constraint of the patellar ligament is
employed to estimate the posture of the patella more reliably.
The geometric transformations of the bone segments propagate
from the top to low layers (following the order of femur, tibia
and patella). Thus, the articulated relationships of the three bone
components are able to be characterized in the knee model.

On the other hand, in order to facilitate an understanding
of joint functions and an assessment of the ranges of motion,
the knee model has to represent all relevant bone points in
their natural dimensions, the so-called anatomical coordinate
systems. The anatomical coordinate systems are defined based
on the biomechanics literatures [5], [22]. The x-axes of the
femur, tibia, and patella coordinate systems are all parallel to
the transepicondylar line. The y-axes of the three bone segments
are determined by their respective longitudinal axes, and their
z-axes are regarded as the outer product of the x- and y-axes.
2) Joint Mechanism: Generally, knee motion depends on the
integrated movements of the knee bone segments constrained by
the joint mechanism. There are two joints in the knee structure;
one is the femorotibial joint, which determines the movement of
tibia with respect to the femur, and the other is the patellofemoral
joint, which controls the movement of patella with respect to
the femur. To estimate the joint parameters of a given subject,
at least two known postures are required for the purpose of
analyzing the joint motion. By using our previously developed
registration-based segmentation method [17], the knee bones
in postures 2 and 3 can be automatically segmented. The geometric transformations, determining the relative motion of knee
bones between different postures, can be obtained from the segmentation step for the purpose of deriving the femorotibial and
patellofemoral joint parameters.
a) Femorotibial joint: The femorotibial joint acts as a modified hinge joint with a bicondylar structure (i.e., the pair of
round bony protrusions in the medial and lateral sides of bottom of the femur). It can afford a combination of motions,
including flexion/extension, rolling, and slight sliding [23]. The
proposed method uses the joint parameters, including two centers of rotation (COR), two axes of rotation (AOR) and a plane
of translation, to simulate the femorotibial joint mechanism.
Note that the rotation angles and displacements with respect
to the joint parameters are called motion parameters. As exemplified in Fig. 4(a), the tibia moves with respect to the
femur from posture 1 to posture 3. The transformation matrix, which describes the movement of the tibia from posture
1 to posture 3, is decomposed into a rotation matrix Rtb =
[r11 r21 r31 ]T [r12 r22 r32 ]T [r13 r23 r33 ]T and a translation
vector ttb . The tibia in the two postures are denoted as tibia1 and

tibia3 , respectively, and their centers of mass (COMs) are represented with mtb1 and mtb3 , respectively. The relative motion
of the tibia can hence be approximated by using a combination
of geometric transformations, including the rotation around the
AOR ktb located at the COR mtb1 , the rotation around the
AOR utb located at the COR Jtb , and the translation on the
plane formed by points Jtb , mtb1 and mtb3 .
Because the rotational motion is the major component of knee
joint motion, we can assume that the motion from tibia1 to tibia3
contains pure rotations in order to simplify the derivation of the
joint parameters. Given the rotation matrix Rtb , we can first
retrieve ktb based on the Euler’s rotation theorem:

⎡

Moreover, with the assumption of the pure rotational motion,
the COR Jtb can be calculated based on the isosceles triangle

where ttb = mtb1 −mtb3 . Axis utb can also be given by
utb = [mtb1 − Jtb ] × [mtb3 − Jtb ].

(3)

Consequently, using (1)–(3), all the joint parameters of the
femorotibial joint can be estimated.
The tibia movements contain not only the flexion/extension
rotation, but also the adduction/abduction and internal/external
rotations, more or less. Thus, both the two rotation axes are
used to simulate the tibia motion more realistically. On the other
hand, there may be small variations from the assumption of the
rotational motion because the tibia is physically allowed to slide
slightly. To handle such variations, the model further affords
translational motion along the plane through Jtb , mtb1 , and
mtb3 . With the femorotibial joint parameters, the 3-D posture
of the tibia can be represented by
Tb = Rθ k t b ,k t b Tb + Rθ u t b ,u t b mtb + Ttb

x,tb y

(4)

where Tb and Tb represent the 3-D coordinates of the tibia
points in the knee model with respect to the tibia coordinate
and reference coordinate systems, respectively. Rθ k t b ,k t b and
Rθ u t b ,u t b represent the rotation matrices given by rotation angles θktb and θutb , with respect to AORs ktb and utb . Ttb x,tb y
indicates the translation vector with two small displacements
ttb x and ttb y , which are constrained by the plane formed by
points Jtb , mtb1 , and mtb2 . By giving the motion parameters θktb , θutb , ttb x , and ttb y , we can consequently determine
a proper posture for the tibia based on the femorotibial joint
mechanism.
b) Patellofemoral joint: The motion of the patella with respect
to the femur is controlled by the patellofemoral joint mechanism.
There is a strong, flat fibrous band called the patellar ligament
that adjoins the margins of the patella to the tuberosity of the
tibia, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 2(b). While the tibia
flexes, the patellar ligament will simultaneously lead the patella

to slide along the femoral trochlear groove to avoid excessive
stretching. To characterize such a motion in the proposed knee
model, we use the joint parameters, including a COR, an AOR,
and a translation trajectory, to simulate the patellofemoral joint
mechanism.
The motion of the patella with respect to the femur between
posture 1 and posture 3 is shown in Fig. 4(b). The patellae in
the two postures are denoted as patella1 and patella3 , respectively, and their COMs are represented with mp1 and mp3 ,
respectively. Tbref1 and Tbref3 represent the positions of tibia
tuberosity in postures 1 and 3, respectively. The motion of the
patella can be characterized by the rotation around the AOR kp
located at the COR mp1 , and the translation along trajectory
Tra.
The AOR kp can be estimated using (1), while the trajectory
Tra can be derived based on the spatial relationship between
patella and femoral trochlear groove in different postures. To
obtain a better approximation of the trajectory, three postures
of the patella are utilized here. We first project the COM of the
patella in the three postures along its posterior direction (z-axis
of patella coordinate) onto the femur surface. The projection
points are denoted as p1 , p2 , and p3 , respectively, as indicated
in Fig. 5(a). Then, we uniformly sample several points on the
two line segments linking the three projection points, and move
the lines to fit the closest curve on the femur surface of the knee
model, as indicated by the solid curve p in Fig. 5(b). The curve
p is located in the plane through the three points p1 , p2 , and
p3 which are the projected positions of the three COMs mp1 ,
mp2 , and mp3 . Moreover, it is with dense points via B-spline
interpolation. Next, p1 , p2 , and p3 on the curve are aligned back
to mp1 , mp2 , and mp3 , respectively. The trajectory Tra is then
parameterized based on the sum of the weighted shifts in p1 , p2 ,
and p3 to better match the shape of the femur trochlear groove:

of the knee model with respect to the patella coordinate and reference coordinate systems, respectively. mp and mp represent
the COMs of the patella before and after the tibia moves, respectively. tbref and tbref are the 3-D coordinates of the tuberosity point of the tibia before and after movements, respectively.
Rθ p ,k p indicates the rotation matrix given by rotation angle θp

small displacements tp x and tp y constrained by the plane containing the patella slide trajectory. By giving the values of the
motion parameters θp , tp x and tp y , a 3-D posture of the patella
can be determined using (6).
As these joint parameters are directly estimated based on the
multipostural MR images, the resulting parameters can better
match the joint motion patterns of the given subject. For each
subject, the joint parameters are automatically determined based
on the multipostural MR images before the model-based registration step (see Section II-F). The subject-specific joint model
can then be used to adjust the knee posture to match different
frames in the fluoroscopic image sequence, or even images from
different acquisitions of the same subject.
E. Fluoroscopic Image Processing

In order to extract the image features for the registration process, several image processing techniques are sequentially implemented on the fluoroscopic images. First, a contrast-limited
adaptive histogram equalization approach [24] is used to enTra(s) =
hance image contrast, and then the anisotropic diffusion smooth⎧
⎨p(s) + w 1 , 2 (s)(m p 1 − p 1 ) + (1 − w 1 , 2 (s))(m p 2 − p 2 ), s ∈ [1, 2]
ing filter [25] is employed to remove image noises. Next, using

the canny edge detector, we can obtain a set of edge maps of

of edge points but also embed a cost at each pixel of the fluoroscopic image, are used in the following model-based registration
process.
F. Model-Based Image Registration
In the proposed model-based registration, a hierarchical
framework is designed to register the bone segments of the
knee model to each frame of the given video fluoroscopy image.
For each bone segment, the 2-D–3-D registration is achieved
by using an iterative optimization algorithm. At first, the 3-D
posture of the bone segment is adjusted according to its corresponding joint parameters. Then, an SR is generated for the
posture-adjusted bone segment. The similarity between the SR
and fluoroscopic image is subsequently evaluated based on an
edge-based fitness measure. The iterative process is regarded
as converged until the fitness value is maximized. The geometric transformation determining the relative motion of the bone
segment can be estimated and then propagated according to
the bone hierarchy. After all the bone segments are registered,
the 3-D posture of the knee model best matched to the current
fluoroscopic frame can be readily obtained, and used as the initial guess of the knee posture in the next frame. Therefore, the
knee moving postures recorded in the entire fluoroscopic image sequence, with the exception of the first frame, can then be
identified automatically. As to the first frame, we can manually
adjust the parameters to give a reasonable initial posture, and
then optimize it using the proposed registration method.
1) Generation of the SR: The SR, a synthetic X-ray image of
a 3-D object, is generated by simulating the X-ray attenuation in
the imaging process. Given the initial posture of a bone segment
from the knee model, we project the points of the bone segment
onto the x–y plane of the reference coordinate system, and the
coordinates of the projection points are calculated by (xi , yi ) =
(xi · f /(f – zi ), yi · f /(f – zi )), where f is the principal distance, and
(xi , yi , zi ) represents the 3-D coordinate of the ith point of the
bone segment with respect to the reference coordinate system.
Considering the fact X-ray image intensities are determined
based on the attenuation degree of X-rays detected by the film,
we characterize the distribution of X-ray attenuation based on a
2-D map of summation of projection points. First, the number
of bone points on the line from the X-ray source to each pixel of
the SR is recorded. Then, by normalizing the histogram values
to the interval [0, 255], we can obtain the SR [see Fig. 7(a)].

2) Chamfer Matching with Noncorresponding Point Removal: We present an edge-based matching algorithm for the
3-D posture of the knee bone model and the underlying fluoroscopic image. For the sake of extracting the bone edge information from the SR, first, an edge map (SRem ) is constructed
by retaining the border points between the bone region and the
background and by preserving the inner points with intensity
smaller than 150 [see Fig. 7(b)]. Ideally, given an optimal posture for a knee bone segment, the edge points on the SRem should
perfectly match the zero-grayscale pixels of the DFI from the
fluoroscopic image. The fitness measure Fit is hence designed
based on the chamfer distance error [27]:

where ci is the coordinate of the ith edge points in the SRem , N
is the number of edge points in the SRem , and DF(ci ) indicates
its corresponding distance value in the DFI. The optimal posture
of the processed bone segment can be estimated by solving the
corresponding motion parameters that maximize (8) based on
the Powell’s multidimensional direction set method [28].
However, due to uneven X-ray absorption in the processed
anatomical structures, the bone borders extracted from the fluoroscopic images are usually less complete and more disordered
than those in the SRem , as can be seen in the comparisons
shown between Fig. 7(b) and (c) (see the condyle edges). Such
improper correspondence of edge points between the SRem and
fluoroscopic image is likely to cause unsatisfactory registration
results. To handle this issue, we modify the matching algorithm
by incorporating the noncorresponding point removal scheme
(see Algorithm 1).
In the following experiments, the proportion values in the
sixth step of Algorithm 1 were empirically assigned as 0.85, 0.7,
and 0.8 for the femur, tibia, and patella, respectively. Fig. 7(d)

shows an example of SRem after removing noncorresponding
points. It can be seen that the resulting SRem is better matched
to the bone borders in the fluoroscopic image. Fig. 8 shows
two examples for qualitative comparison between pure chamfer matching and the proposed method. It is found that if all
the edge points in SRem participate in the matching process,
the registration tends to be trapped by undesirable local solutions (indicated by arrows). In contrast, the proposed method
can select the edge points by finding the adequate cut on the
cumulative distribution function, thus achieving a better match
between the SR and the actual fluoroscopic image.
As the proposed joint-constraint model embeds the 3-D motion constraints of the total knee from multipostural MR images,
the spatial relationship between the knee bone segments can be
properly maintained during the registration process. The insufficiency of depth information can thus be compensated, and
correct registration results can be achieved.

postures in the interpolating trajectory and also conveniently
obtain smooth knee motion.

G. Joint-Space Interpolation Between Knee Postures
Considering that the radiation dose increases with the frame
rate of fluoroscopy [29], the frame rate is usually limited and
therefore is deficient in regard to capturing each instant of knee
motion. To provide clinicians with detailed dynamic information
of knee bone geometries, we present a joint-space interpolation
scheme to generate knee postures during activity more densely.
From the previous 2-D–3-D registration step, we can obtain
a set of sequential but discontinuous moving knee postures,
each of which is matched to a frame of the fluoroscopic image
sequence. The interpolation between two adjacent knee postures
is achieved by using the proposed knee joint mechanism:

 2−r


t
t
M2−a Vr0
(9)
Vr =
a=0

where t ∈ [0, 1] is the time index in the whole motion sequence.
The source and target postures are specified with t equals to
zero and one, respectively. Vrt represents the surface of the bone
segment of layer r (r = 2: femur, r = 1: tibia, and r = 0: patella)
in the frame at time t, and Vr0 is the surface of the corresponding
bone in the source posture. Mtr is expressed as a combination
of rotation and translation matrices indicating the joint motion
of layer r between the source and target postures in the frame
at time t. By using (9), we can automatically generate proper

III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
The following experiments consisted of three tests on computer simulation, animal cadaver, and in vivo human knee data,
respectively. The computer simulation and the animal cadaver
experiments were conducted to validate the stability and accuracy of the proposed method. Moreover, to show the applicability of the proposed method to human data, we applied our
system on three in vivo knees for reconstructing and analyzing
the motion patterns.
A. Computer Simulation
To validate the stability of the proposed method, we designed
a computer simulation experiment to illustrate how well the
proposed method can perform under various initial conditions.
At first, the ground truth in this experiment was provided by a
knee model with known posture. Based on the ground truth, we
generated an SRem to specify the projection details of the knee
model. It was observed from real fluoroscopic images that partial edges of the condyle, tibia plateau, and patella are too fuzzy
to be extracted, and several irregular noisy edges appear nearby
the bone segment contours. To make the SRem more compatible
with a real one, we manually erased some bone borders (e.g.,
the condyle edges) and added fake edges as the effects of X-ray
imaging artifacts. Fig. 9(a) and (b) shows the SRem before and
after the manual modification, respectively. As the manual modification for the SRem was not performed randomly, and instead,
it was done by referring to the boundary appearance of real fluoroscopic images, the objectivity of the manual modification
for adding noises and complexity in simulated reconstruction
should be acceptable. After that, the DFI of the modified SRem
was used as the input for the model-based registration.
Next, fifty postures were generated by random perturbation
with respect to the ground truth, as different initial conditions
for the registration. The posture perturbation for each bone segment was carried out within a specific range as stated in Table I. Starting from these initial postures, fifty registration results were obtained using the proposed method. One of the fifty
registration results was demonstrated to quantitatively show the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Fig. 9(c) and (d) shows

the knee model with initial posture (pink) coupled with the
ground truth (green) before and after the registration, respectively. It can be observed that even though the femur, tibia, and
patella are initially far away from their true positions, each bone
segment can be well fitted to the ground truth, since the jointconstraint model allows an efficient search for the registration
solutions.
Beyond the qualitative evaluation, we also conducted quantitative assessment in the computer simulation experiment. Each
of the fifty registration results was evaluated based on the mean
target registration error (mTRE) [30], which is defined to measure the average surface distance between the registered model
and the ground truth:
mTRE =

M

Ki − Ki 
M i=1

(10)

where Ki and Ki represent the ith point of the ground truth
and the registered knee model, respectively. M is the number
of surface points in the knee model (femur: 77739; tibia (with
fibula): 73123; patella: 16495). Table II shows the mean and
standard deviation (SD) for the mTREs of each bone segment
under the fifty initial conditions.
B. Animal Cadaver
An animal cadaveric experiment was conducted to validate
the accuracy of the proposed method. Since the structure of
lamb knee is similar to that of human, a lamb cadaveric knee
was selected as the material for this experiment. At first, we
cut off the knee from the hind leg of a lamb cadaver, including the femur, tibia, patella, and soft tissues (e.g., muscles and
ligaments) around the knee joint. Then, we implanted 11 metallic markers with radius of 2.25 mm on the bone surfaces (four
on the femur, four on the tibia, and three on the patella). The
knee was subsequently placed and fixed on a self-made support
to acquire three different postural volumetric images for the
purpose of constructing the knee joint-constraint model. The
posture of the cadaveric knee could be adjusted by changing the

bending angle of the support [see Fig. 10(a)]. In order to obtain
the signals for the metallic markers which are prohibited in MR
imaging, a CT device (Siemens Sensation 16) was utilized in
this experiment. Fig. 10(b) shows the reconstructed surfaces of
the cadaveric knee model and metallic markers. In addition, a
continuous motion sequence for the cadaver knee was recorded
using single-plane video fluoroscopy in 186 frames. For the
purpose of accuracy validation, we applied the proposed registration system to reconstruct the cadaveric knee motion.
Since the markers are attached directly onto the surfaces of
bone segments, the positions of the markers are able to determine the actual bone motion. Moreover, the markers on the
fluoroscopic images present sharp and clear boundary appearances. Therefore, the ground-truth transformation of each bone
segment can be accurately obtained by registering its corresponding markers to the underlying fluoroscopic image [16]. To
ensure the accuracy of the ground truth, the marker registration
result of each frame was further confirmed by an expert. The
registration errors were evaluated by the difference between the
ground-truth transformation and the one obtained by the proposed method [30], [31]. To facilitate the evaluation, we also
decomposed the 3-D rigid transformation into three displacements along the three axes of the reference coordinate system,
and three rotation angles around the three axes of reference coordinate system. For each of the six parameters, the average
difference of the 186 frames is listed in Table III. Other than
that, we also applied the two transformations to each bone segment of the knee model for assessing the mTRE. The mTREs
of the 186 image frames for the femur, tibia, and patella were
1.15 ± 0.24, 1.48 ± 0.2, 0.75 ± 0.3 mm, respectively.

C. In Vivo Human Knees
In this experiment, we reconstructed three in vivo human knee
motion using the proposed registration system, and accounted
for the motion using both qualitative and quantitative observations. Two males and one female (twenty-four, twenty-five, and
thirty years-old, respectively), who had no history of knee disorders, gave informed consent to participate in this study. Three
postural MR images with bending degrees 0, 30, and 60, and
a video fluoroscopy image recording the knee flexion motion
of each subject were acquired. After the 2-D–3-D registration,
we utilized the proposed joint space interpolation approach to
obtain knee moving postures more densely. Fig. 11 shows eight
sequentially moving postures acquired during the reconstructed
motion, by which the dynamic spatial configuration between the
femur, tibia, and patella can be clearly visualized. In addition,
we further incorporated the patellar ligament (in purple), whose
surface was manually constructed from the MR images, to increase the level of completion of the demonstration. It can be
seen that the patellar ligament is stretchable to flexibly maintain
the patella height in the knee joint structure. We believe that
such a visualization of dynamic knee geometry is beneficial for
medical education and practice.
On the other hand, we analyzed the motion pattern of three
in vivo knees by decomposing the registration transformations
into 6-degree-of-freedom relative motion. More specifically, the
relative motion, including three rotations (flexion/extension, adduction/adduction, and internal/external) and three translations
(medial/lateral, posterior/anterior and proximal/distal), could
be estimated based on the geometric transformations between
the tibia and femur coordinate systems, and between patella
and femur coordinate systems [22], [32]. Fig. 12 illustrates
the reconstructed motion patterns of the three subjects, including rotational and translational motion of femorotibial and
patellofemoral joints during knee flexion.

Fig. 12. Reconstruction of in vivo knee motion pattern; (a)–(d) subject 1,
(e)–(h) subject 2, and (i)–(l) subject 3. For each subject, the four figures are
sequentially shown as rotational motion in the femorotibial joint, rotational
motion in the patellofemoral joint, translational motion in the femorotibial joint,
and translational motion in the patellofemoral joint. The movement before the
slash is with positive slope, and after the slash is with negative slope.

IV. DISCUSSIONS
From the computer simulation experiment, it can be seen that
the average mTRE after the registration was largely improved
from 8.09 to 1.37 mm. The registration errors were small and
acceptable in contrast with the criterion of 2 mm for a failed

registration [30], [31]. In addition, the registration errors were
also assessed based on a relative measure, which is the ratio of
the mTRE to the actual length of a bone segment. The resulting
error ratios for the femur, tibia, and patella were found to be

180

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 1, JANUARY 2014

small, 1.13%, 2.02%, and 3.21%, respectively. As a whole, the
stability of the proposed method was proven satisfactory in the
computer simulation experiment.
In the animal cadaveric experiment, the average differences
from the ground-truth transformation were less than 1 mm in
errors presented in Fregly’s work (around 5 mm for the femur
and tibia/fibula and 10 mm for the patella) [9], ours (0.12 ±
0.13 mm for the femur, 0.74 ± 0.37 mm for the tibia, and 0.37 ±
0.32 mm for the patella) were relatively small and acceptable.
The rotation error of the tibia around the y-axis was larger than
those around the other two axes. It was probably because the
lamb does not contain a fibula, which provides helpful edge
information in determining the y-axis rotation of the tibia. This
phenomenon also indicates that grouping the tibia and fibula as
one bone component for edge-based 2-D–3-D registration (in
human knees) could achieve a better estimation of tibia pose
than registering the tibia individually. Moreover, the mTREs for
the femur, tibia, and patella were 1.15 ± 0.24, 1.48 ± 0.2 and
0.75 ± 0.3 mm, respectively, which were considered successful
according to the criterion of 2 mm [30], [31]. The registration
errors, compared with the actual lengths of the cadaveric femur
(39 mm), tibia (42 mm), and patella (20 mm), were also quite
small.
As shown in Fig. 12 in the in vivo knee testing, the flexion of the femorotibial joint is coupled with the adduction and
internal rotations. Such a phenomenon has been reported by
Wilson et al. [33] on the motion analysis of human cadaveric
knees. Yet, the coupled motions in our in vivo study are less
than those in Wilson’s study utilizing cadaver knees for motion
analysis. The logical explanation of such a difference is because
the joint constraints of in vivo knees supported by major soft tissues (e.g., muscle tension) and proprioceptive responses must be
stronger than those of cadaver knees. Thus, the smaller adduction/adduction rotation observed in our results can be reasonably
accounted for.
Fig. 12 also shows that the knee flexion to be coupled with
obvious external and inconspicuous abduction/adduction rotations of patellofemoral joint. Such findings can also be physiologically explained from the anatomical point of view since
the bicondylar structure of the femur certainly limits the range
of abduction/adduction of the patella. Although the true kinematics of the in vivo knees were not available for validation,
the sequences of the reconstructed motion showed reasonable
physiologic patterns of motion. Consequently, the proposed system can demonstrate good applicability in reconstructing in vivo
human knee motion.
Another merit of the proposed registration method is the efficiency of the time with regard to user interaction. To the best of
our knowledge, in order to obtain a good registration, existing
2-D–3-D registration approaches require users to manually put
the processed bone model close to the true position on each
image frame. However, such a requirement is demanding when
there are a large number of images contained in a motion sequence like the present study. Different from current methods,
the proposed model-based method only needs this manual step
done in the first frame and can accomplish the registration of
the total knee in a fully automatic process for the rest of im-

age frames. The computation time required for registering the
whole dataset of one subject was assessed on a computer with
an Intel Core i3–2310M processor (2.10 GHz) and 4.0 GB of
memory. For the whole dataset of one subject (containing about
67 frames, and including 3 bone components in each frame),
the total computation time was averagely in 75.05 min, and the
average time for each frame was in 1.19 min. The computation
cost can be further reduced by using a faster computer processor or a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based platform in the
future.
The knee joint belongs to a condylar joint, which permits
movements primarily in one plane; for example, the primary
motion of the knee joint is flexion or extension in a sagittal
plane, and other angular rotations and displacements were small
[34], [35]. Moreover, the rocking motion of the patella is also
approximately planar [35]. It can be reasonably inferred that
the joint parameters such as AORs and CORs present limited
variations from the ideal planar joint motion, and thus meet the
aforementioned physical phenomena. The reproducibility of the
joint models can thus be confirmed in some sense.
Although we did not have available diseased knees for the
experiments in this paper, we will apply the model-based system to investigate the kinematics of pathological knee joints
in the future. The concept of the proposed method was to approximate the 3-D femorotibial and patellofemoral joint models
based on the multipostural MR images, and then to estimate the
joint motion parameters using the reconstructed joint models
from the corresponding sagittal fluoroscopic image sequence.
If the observed pathological case does not involve any deformity of the joint structure, the proposed model is still capable
of reconstructing the joint motion based on the coupling of 3-D
reconstructed model and corresponding fluoroscopic image sequence. For instance, if the subject suffers from anterior cruciate
ligament injury and the abnormal motion of knee joint can be
shown in both MR and fluoroscopic images, the reconstructed
motion model still can reflect the exact motion of the subject.
Yet, the motion model might not be smooth if the observed
pathological case involves deformity of joint structure, which
could be a potential limitation of the present system.
V. CONCLUSION
We have proposed a new 2-D–3-D registration system, which
combines the articulated joint models, kinematics properties,
and image features, for reconstructing total knee motion using
single-plane fluoroscopy. The joint models can properly characterize the solution space of 2-D–3-D registration, reducing the
effects of insufficient information from the single-plane fluoroscopy on the accuracy of the motion reconstruction. Another
notable feature of the proposed system is that the fluoroscopybased patella tracking can be achieved though the image and
shape features of the patella are not salient. We also presented
the noncorresponding point removal scheme with the chamfer
distance measure to successfully reduce the instability of edge
matching in the 2-D–3-D registration.
Three experiments including computer simulation, animal
cadaveric, and in vivo knee testing were conducted to validate

CHEN et al.: JOINT-CONSTRAINT MODEL-BASED SYSTEM FOR RECONSTRUCTING TOTAL KNEE MOTION

the effectiveness of the proposed method. We achieved satisfactory accuracy of registration for the femur, tibia, and patella
with mTREs less than 1.5 mm. Moreover, the out-of-plane
translation error, which is a common problem for conventional
2-D–3-D registration methods, was found to be small (less than
1 mm) using the proposed joint models. In the future, effort
will be devoted to assessing the differences in motion patterns
between healthy and diseased knees. We can also complete the
knee model by including more anatomical tissues, so that the
interaction between rigid and soft tissues during knee activity
can be better demonstrated for evaluating the knee functionality.
