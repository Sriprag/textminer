An Efficient Technique for Nuclei Segmentation
Based on Ellipse Descriptor Analysis and Improved
Seed Detection Algorithm
Hongming Xu, Cheng Lu, Student Member, IEEE, and Mrinal Mandal, Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—In this paper, we propose an efficient method for segmenting cell nuclei in the skin histopathological images. The proposed technique consists of four modules. First, it separates the
nuclei regions from the background with an adaptive threshold
technique. Next, an elliptical descriptor is used to detect the isolated nuclei with elliptical shapes. This descriptor classifies the
nuclei regions based on two ellipticity parameters. Nuclei clumps
and nuclei with irregular shapes are then localized by an improved
seed detection technique based on voting in the eroded nuclei regions. Finally, undivided nuclei regions are segmented by a marked
watershed algorithm. Experimental results on 114 different image
patches indicate that the proposed technique provides a superior
performance in nuclei detection and segmentation.

I. INTRODUCTION
NALYSIS of cell nuclei plays an important role in the
histopathological examination and diagnosis. Application
includes diagnosis of critical diseases such as breast or skin cancer [1], [2]. Most diagnoses rendered by anatomical pathologists
are generally based on the microscopic analysis of haematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) stained section. Anatomical pathologists, especially cytopathologists, give special attention to the analysis
of nuclei size, shape, contours, and presence or absence of nucleoli and mitotic figures within nuclei [3]. The morphological
features and changes of the cell nuclei in tissues have great diagnostic value for pathological examination, and act as key roles
in providing support for early cancer detection and prevention.
As the pathologists typically identify the constituent cells
of interest based on their personal experience, the judgments
by them are subjective and sometimes lead to intra- and interobserver variability [4]. With recent advances in digital imaging
and computer hardware, computer-aided analysis of histopathological slides has become important [5]. Automated analysis of
histopathological images can help in making fast diagnosis and

provide reliable and reproducible objective results. However,
there still remains a huge challenge for a computer algorithm
to perform automated analysis with high accuracy. The difficulties stem from many aspects such as the existence of nuclei
clumps, blurred nuclei boundaries, and intensity variations in
digitized histopathological images. Fig. 1 shows three image
patches obtained from tissue blocks of skin biopsies and stained
with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). In the images, the cell
nuclei are observed as dark blue whereas the intracellular material and cytoplasm are observed as bright pink. As seen, several
cell nuclei touch or overlap each other; color variations exist
in inter and intra images due to nonuniform absorption of the
stains, stains fading, and other factors; some boundaries of the
cell nuclei have been blurred. All these factors make it difficult
to accurately segment the nuclei.
A major limitation of the traditional segmentation techniques
such as histogram based [6] or threshold based [7] techniques
is the under-segmentation of the clumped nuclei. The failure
to separate the nuclei during quantitative histopathological image analysis may degrade the diagnosis performance. In order
to address this, researchers have proposed a few techniques.
The watershed algorithm is widely used for image segmentation due to its advantages of simplicity, speed, and absence of
adjustable parameters [8]. However, the watershed algorithm
usually gives rise to over-segmentation because of many local
minima or under-segmentation for heavily overlapping nuclei.
To overcome the problems of the classical watershed, Yang
et al. [9] used a marker-controlled watershed algorithm to segment clustered nuclei which extracted the markers using condition erosion. However, this technique is sensitive to nuclei
shape, size, and the predefined thresholds for erosion. Cheng
et al. [10] presented a method to extract markers using an adaptive H-minima transform, and a novel marking function for

watershed algorithm. This method applies the same parameters
directly related to the h-value to clustered nuclei in an image
regardless of the nuclei shape and size. Thus, it is difficult to
generate a one-to-one correspondence between the markers and
nuclei. Jung et al. [11] further formulated the marker extraction by H-minima transform as an optimization problem and
adjusted nuclei contours by the parameterized ellipsoidal models. However, this technique assumes that the nucleus has an
elliptical shape, which is not always true. This can be illustrated
by the fact that the 2-D nuclei images may be obtained by partial
imaging or at odd angles [12]. Also note that if the maximum
depth in the distance map is not located at the region around the
nucleus center, both adaptive and optimal selection of h-value
will not result in accurate nuclei detection and segmentation.
A few other promising methods have been proposed to perform segmentation of touching cells or nuclei. Schmitt et al. [13]
proposed a technique for splitting cell clumps by using morphological multiscale decomposition with scalable templates and a
morphological structuring element. Al-Kofaha et al. [12] proposed to detect nuclei markers using the multiscale Laplacianof-Gaussian filtering and cluster nuclei regions based on the
detected seeds. Although these methods have been reported to
provide a good performance, the performance is overly sensitive
to the predefined parameters related to nuclei size and shape.
Wang et al. [14] presented a concavity based approach which
first conducts shape classification, and then identifies a pair
of splitting points and connects them by the weighted shortest
path. This technique is limited to the objects with convex shapes
and heavily relies on the training process for shape classification. Parvin et al. [15] proposed a multi-pass voting (MPV)
algorithm for inferring cell or nuclei centers, which applies the
refined and reoriented kernels for the voting area and considers
the pixels with votes larger than the threshold as the detected
seeds. Qi et al. [16] developed a single-pass voting (SPV) algorithm based on the work in [15], which detects cell seeds
using mean shift clustering algorithm and applies the repulsive
level set model [17] to segment clustered cells. Lu et al. [3]
proposed an adaptive threshold selection method for nuclei segmentation in cutaneous histopathological images. This method
first applies the hybrid morphological reconstruction technique
to enhance the image, and then adaptively selects the threshold
for a local region to conduct nuclei segmentation. Although the
technique separates isolated nuclei or partially touching nuclei
efficiently, it fails to separate highly overlapping nuclei. Plissiti
and Nikou [18] presented a spatially adaptive physical model
for overlapping nuclei segmentation that represents the nucleus

shape by the vibrations of a spring mass system and obtains elastic 2-D boundary by a closed chain topology of virtual masses.
This technique only works automatically for the images with a
known number of nuclei.
Although there have been a number of approaches proposed
for automatic cell nuclei segmentation, the difficulties for most
of them are often due to the fact that the number and locations of cell nuclei are not known. In this paper, we propose an
efficient technique for detecting and segmenting nuclei in cutaneous histopathological images. The proposed technique detects
the isolated nuclei by using the ellipse descriptor analysis, and
segments nuclei clumps by using the marked watershed based
on an improved seed detection algorithm.The organization of
this paper is as follows. Section II provides a brief review of the
background work. Section III describes the proposed technique
in detail, followed by performance evaluations in Section IV.
The conclusions are presented in Section V.

II. REVIEW OF BACKGROUND WORK
In this section, we present a brief review of three selected
state-of-the-art techniques that are closely related to our proposed technique.
In our previous work, we proposed a local optimal threshold
technique [3] for nuclei segmentation in skin histopathological
images. This technique first applies the hybrid morphological
reconstruction operations to reduce noise and intensity variations within nuclei regions. The nuclei shape and size are then
incorporated as domain specific knowledge to select local optimal threshold for nuclei segmentation. The technique provides
a good performance on images with mostly isolated nuclei, e.g.,
images obtained in the skin epidermis area. However, if the images have a large number of overlapping nuclei, e.g., images
obtained in the skin dermis area, the segmentation performance
degrades.
Parvin et al. [15] proposed an MPV algorithm for detecting cell or nuclei centers in microscopic images. The MPV
algorithm determines a cone-shape voting area in the gradient
direction of high gradient pixels [see Fig. 2(a)]. The parameters
rm in and rm ax are estimated based on the prior knowledge of
the average nuclei size. All pixels within the area ABCD get a
vote weighted by the following Gaussian kernel centered at P :
−( x 2 + y 2 )

g (x, y) = √

where (x, y) is an image point. For the area ABCD, the weight
is highest for pixels on the arc AB, and smallest for pixels on
the arc CD. In the second-pass voting, the angle Δ is made
smaller (i.e., Δ2 < Δ1 ), and the voting direction for a pixel is
aligned towards the closest pixel cluster with highest votes [see
Fig. 2(b), (c)]. The subsequent passes are executed in a similar
manner. When all N iterations are carried out, the pixels with
votes larger than the threshold are considered as seeds.
Qi et al. [16] proposed an SPV algorithm with a new Gaussian
kernel to improve the seed detection performance of the MPV
algorithm. Here, the Gaussian kernel g (x, y, ux , uy , σ) centered
at the point (ux , uy ) as defined below is applied on the coneshape voting area (see Fig. 3):

where ux = x0 +r cos θ, uy = y0 +r sin θ, and r = (r m i n +r
.

The modes of the vote image are detected using the mean shift
clustering [19] after the voting. The Gaussian kernel in (2) amplifies the votes around the center of the voting area and is able to
avoid creating false seeds in the overlapping regions. The SPV
algorithm reduces the computational complexity significantly.
After detecting the cell seeds, cell segmentation is conducted
using a level set algorithm, where the detected seeds are used as
the initialization of the repulsive level set model [17]. The contour of each cell is obtained by evolving the level set function.
Although the SPV algorithm [16] provides a good performance
in cells or nuclei seed detection, there still exist two limitations. First, selecting the pixels with high gradient magnitude
as the voting points may generate false seeds. This usually happens when there exist inter- and intra-intensity variations in the
background and nuclei regions, and a fixed threshold is used
for the entire image database. Second, generation of the coneshape voting area for voting points (i.e., high gradient points)
by searching pixels from the whole image is a time consuming
process. This is most evident when we deal with a large image.
Based on the above analysis, we propose here an efficient
technique for the segmentation of both isolated nuclei and nuclei clumps. The proposed technique is implemented based on

an initial segmentation of nuclei regions, which is followed by a
fine segmentation of nuclei clumps. The isolated nuclei obtained
after initial segmentation are detected by an ellipse descriptor
analysis. Nuclei clumps are segmented by the marked watershed with an improved seed detection algorithm. Overall, the
limitations of our previous work [3] and the SPV algorithm [16]
are addressed.
III. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE
The schematic of the proposed technique for cell nuclei segmentation is shown in Fig. 4. It is observed that there are four
modules. In the first module, an initial segmentation of cell nuclei regions is performed using an adaptive thresholding technique. In the second module, an elliptical descriptor is used to
filter the isolated nuclei with elliptical shapes in the initially
segmented binary image. This descriptor classifies the isolated
nuclei according to two ellipticity parameters of the nuclei region. In the third module, an efficient voting algorithm is applied
to detect seeds of nuclei clumps and the nuclei with irregular
shapes. In the fourth module, the undivided nuclei are segmented
by the marked watershed algorithm with the contours adjusted
by the ellipsoidal modeling. The details of four modules are now
presented in the following.
A. Initial Segmentation
Due to the staining imperfection and variation, the pixel intensity in nuclei regions is not homogenous. Blurred nuclei boundaries and noisy pixels in the background are usually observed.
The traditional low level segmentation methods (i.e., histogram
based method [6]) generally fail to precisely segment the cell
nuclei regions from the background pixels. After comparing
several segmentation techniques including Otsu’s method [7],
active contour model [20], [21], and graph cut [22], an adaptive
threshold technique [3] is adopted for the initial segmentation
of cell nuclei in this paper.
The principal steps for initial segmentation by the adaptive
threshold technique are:
1) Enhance the image using the hybrid gray-scale morphological reconstructions module. In this module, the
R channel of the original RGB image is used as

the input. Opening-by-Reconstruction and Closing-byReconstruction are consecutively applied to reduce the
impact of undesirable variations in the image and to make
the nuclei region homogenous.
2) Apply the adaptive thresholding [23] on the enhanced image. For each pixel in the enhanced image, a threshold
is calculated as the mean intensity of the local neighborhood (e.g., 60 × 60). Since the intensity of nuclei regions is
lower than the background, a pixel value below the threshold is set to the foreground value (represented by 1), and
a pixel value above the threshold is set to the background
value (represented by 0).
3) Enhance the segmented result by a series of morphological operations. The holes within the segmented regions
are filled by performing the morphological reconstruction.
The small isolated regions, unlikely to be the nuclei, are
removed by conducting an opening operation with a disc
structuring element. Fig. 5(a) shows an original image,
and Fig. 5(b) shows the segmentation result.

sum of squared algebraic distances between the ellipse and the
2-D boundary points of the connected region [24].
After generating the elliptical model for each region Np , the
ellipticity evaluation is performed by comparing the region of
Np and the corresponding ellipse. Let Rn be the set of pixels
in Np (i.e., the nucleus or the nuclei clump), and Re be the
set of pixels in the elliptical region. We use the following two
parameters e1 and e2 to measure the ellipticity of a region:
e1 =

|Rn ∩ Re |
|Re |

(4)

e2 =

|Rn ΔRe |
|Re |

(5)

B. Ellipse Descriptor Analysis
It is observed in Fig. 5(b) that initial segmentation results in
both isolated nuclei and nuclei clumps. Assume that the segmented regions in Fig. 5(b) are denoted as {Np }p=1...Z , where
Z is the total number of regions. In this module, we classify
{Np }p=1...Z as the isolated nuclei or the nuclei clump. Based
on the observation that the isolated nuclei in skin histopathological images typically have elliptical boundaries, most isolated
nuclei can be detected by using an elliptical model. To build
the elliptical model for each region in {Np }p=1...Z , we first calculate the gradient image of the initial segmentation result, and
then obtain the boundary points by selecting positions with nonzero gradient magnitudes. Using the obtained boundary points,
each region in {Np }p=1...Z is now mathematically described
by an elliptical model. Let (x, y) be a 2-D boundary point of
a connected region. The ellipse is modeled by the following
second-order polynomial [24]:
E (a, x) = a · x = ax2 + bxy + cy 2 + dx + ey + f = 0 (3)
where a = [a b c d e f ]T denotes the ellipse coefficients,

T
x = x2 xy y 2 x y 1 , and E (a, x) is the algebraic distance
from the point (x, y) to the conic E (a, x) = 0. The optimal
ellipse fitting the nuclei shape is generated by minimizing the

where |·| is the cardinality of the pixels set, ∩ is the intersection
operation, and Δ is the symmetric difference operation. Intuitively, the higher value of the ellipticity parameter e1 and the
lower value of the ellipticity parameter e2 represent a closer
match to an elliptical shape. Thus, the candidate region with
high value of e1 and low value of e2 is more likely to be a single
nucleus. On the other hand, a region with lower value of e1 but
higher value of e2 is expected to be a nuclei clump or a nucleus
with the irregular shape.
An example of the ellipse descriptor analysis is shown in
Fig. 6. Fig. 6(a) shows the ellipses obtained by fitting the boundary points of the binary image shown in Fig. 5(b). The markers
A, B, C indicate the three regions formed by the touching nuclei, while the markers D, E, F indicate three typically isolated
cell nuclei with elliptical shapes. Fig. 6(b) also shows the constructed ellipses superimposed on the original image. The values
of the ellipticity parameters e1 and e2 for the candidate regions
A − F are shown in Table I. It is observed that the regions of
the single nucleus D, E, F have high values of e1 (close to 1.0)
and low values of e2 (close to 0.0). In contrast, the candidate
regions A, B, C are separately formed by two touching nuclei,

and they have relatively lower values of e1 (around 0.8 ∼ 0.9)
but higher values of e2 (around 0.2 ∼ 0.3). Therefore, the single
nucleus with elliptical shape is detected by the aforementioned
two defined parameters. A segmented region Np is determined
as a single nucleus if both of the following two conditions are
satisfied:
e1 ≥ τ1

(6)

e2 ≤ τ2

(7)

where τ1 and τ2 are the predefined thresholds. In order to calculate the parameters τ1 and τ2 , 170 nuclei regions in 15 randomly
selected image patches are manually labeled, and the values of
e1 and e2 for each region are calculated. Fig. 7 shows the box
plots of ellipticity parameters for isolated nuclei and nuclei
clumps in 170 nuclei regions. It is observed that isolated nuclei
on average have a high value of e1 (0.96) and a low value of e2
(0.07), whereas nuclei clumps have a lower value of e1 (0.85)
and a higher value of e2 (0.30). The isolated nuclei with elliptical shapes can be separated from nuclei clumps by thresholding
the two ellipticity parameters. In this paper, the values of τ1 and
τ2 are calculated as follows:
e1N + e1C
2
e2N + e2C
τ2 =
2
τ1 =

(8)
(9)

where e1N and e1C are the average values of e1 for isolated
nuclei and nuclei clumps, e2N and e2C are the average values
of e2 for isolated nuclei and nuclei clumps, respectively. Note
that the nuclei regions (i.e., single nucleus) that satisfies the
above two conditions in Fig 6(b) are marked with crosses at the
ellipse centers. The subsequent sections are not applied on these
regions, while the other regions [i.e., nuclei clumps A, B, C in
Fig 6(a)] are segmented by the marked watershed algorithm.
C. Seed Detection
After the ellipse descriptor analysis, most isolated cell nuclei with elliptical shapes have been detected. To segment the
remaining cell nuclei regions, for example the regions A − C
shown in Fig 6(a), the marked watershed algorithm is applied. In
this module, we present a voting algorithm for detecting seeds

nuclei region after the erosion operation.

of nuclei clump and nuclei with irregular shapes. The detected
seeds are used as the markers for watershed algorithm.
Assume that the nuclei regions, which are waiting for seed
detection, are denoted as {Ni }i=1...K , where K is the number
of connected regions. The regions {Ni }i=1...K are first labeled
via an eight-connected criterion [23], and then each region is put
into a binary image which has the same size as the original image. Let Ii (x, y) be a binary image which contains a region Ni .
The boundary points set Ti (x, y), the corresponding image gradient ∇Ti (x, y) and the gradient magnitude 	∇Ti (x, y)	 are
computed subsequently. Since the nuclei regions in the binary
image Ii (x, y) are the white foreground, the voting direction
for a boundary point is defined as the positive gradient direction
∇T (x,y )
	∇T (x,y )	 = (cos (θ (x, y)) , sin (θ (x, y))), where θ is the angle
of the gradient direction with respect to the horizontal direction
of the image. Fig. 8 illustrates an example of voting for a boundary point (x0 , y0 ). The parameters rm in , rm ax , and Δ define a
cone-shape voting area. The dashed contours represent the extracted boundary points. The potential voting region (e.g., the
yellow region) is obtained by performing the erosion operation
on the original nuclei region. The points (e.g., red points) in
both the cone-shape voting area and the potential voting region
get the votes weighed by the Gaussian kernel centered at the
point (ux , uy ). The Gaussian kernel is defined in (2).
Note that prior to voting towards the gradient direction of
boundary points, the erosion operation is applied to shrink the
nuclei region Ni . The structuring element S for the erosion

The disk-shaped structuring element with radius of three pixels
is empirically applied such that the erosion operation is able to
retain the actual shape when reducing the size of nuclei regions.
In this paper, the size of each region in {Ni }i=1...K is reduced
by at least half. But note that if the erosion operation has generated the isolated small region (i.e., ≤100 pixels), it should stop
continually eroding the obtained small region to avoid the small
nucleus disappearing. The erosion operation is performed for
two reasons. First, the nuclei centers are far away from nuclei
boundaries, and hence there is no need to vote for pixels near the
nuclei edges. Although the cone-shape voting area used in [16]
could theoretically avoid the votes approaching to nuclei edges,
in practice the pixels near nuclei boundaries or even outside
nuclei regions may still get votes [see Fig. 9(c) where the votes
outside nuclei regions are marked with solid rectangles]. This is
because nuclei shape and size vary greatly from each other, but
the fixed parameters rm in and rm ax are used for all nuclei in an
image, and the gradient direction does not always point to nuclei
centers. Second, the erosion operation contributes to reducing
the time requirement of the voting algorithm by reducing the
number of calculations, since the potential voting region (i.e.,
the original nuclei region) has been shrunk and there are fewer
pixels that can get votes. For example, in Fig. 8, only the pixels
in the eroded nuclei region (i.e., yellow region) may get votes.
Now let Vi (x, y) be the vote image for the binary image
Ii , and have the same size as the original image. All pixels in

where (m, n) represents a nuclei edge point, A (m, n) is the voting area for the point (m, n), g (x, y, um , un , σ) is the Gaussian
kernel centered at (um , un ). The final vote image V is the sum
of all images Vi . Assume the value for a point (x, y) ∈ V be
n, we interpret that the point (x, y) is observed n times. Using
the positions of the points in V as the two dimensional feature
space, the nuclei seeds are computed by executing mean shift
clustering algorithm [19]. The detailed process of the proposed
voting algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1.

Our work of seed detection is extended from [16], but it
differs in several significant aspects: (1) The original color image is transformed into a binary one using initial segmentation
techniques discussed in Section A. The boundary points of the
regions {Ni }i=1...K are used for voting. This step is critical
which eliminates the votes from other high gradient pixels in
nuclei regions or the background. (2) Most isolated cell nuclei with elliptical shapes are detected by the ellipse descriptor
analysis discussed in Section B, which avoids unnecessary seed
detection and segmentation for them. (3) Instead of searching
the voting areas from the whole image, we first conduct the
erosion operation on each nuclei region Ni , and then select the
voting areas from the eroded nuclei region. This step enables the
votes to mainly concentrate on the regions around nuclei centers and completely avoids the votes outside the nuclei regions
to generate false seeds. More importantly, selection of the voting
areas from the eroded binary nuclei regions rather than from the
whole image markedly reduces the computational complexity
of the voting algorithm.
In Fig. 9, we compare the entire process of the seed detection
between using the SPV algorithm [16] and the proposed voting
algorithm. The first row of Fig. 9 separately shows the extracted
voting points (i.e., high gradient points), the vote image, the image with vote points, and the image with nuclei seeds generated
by the SPV algorithm, while the second row shows the comparison results using the proposed technique. As seen in Fig. 9(a),
a large number of high gradient pixels in the background are
mistakenly considered as the voting points. The incorrect voting points in the background vote for the pixels outside nuclei
regions, which are enclosed by the solid rectangles in Fig. 9(c).
In Fig. 9(d), the false seeds obtained by clustering vote points
outside nuclei regions are enclosed by solid rectangles, and the
nuclei without seeds due to the blurred edges with low gradient points are enclosed by dashed rectangles. In Fig. 9(h), the
crosses × indicate the centers obtained by the ellipse descriptor analysis, whereas the crosses + represent the nuclei seeds
obtained by the proposed voting algorithm. For more examples of seed detection results, please refer to the seed detection
performance in Section IV.

D. Nuclei Segmentation
Using the detected seeds obtained from section C as the
markers, the segmentation of nuclei clumps can be efficiently
performed by the marked watershed algorithm. However, the
segmentation by watershed algorithm not only depends on the
markers but also depends on the marking function [10]. For
separation of partially touching nuclei, the watershed algorithm
using the classical marking function [8] works well, but it fails
to separate highly overlapping nuclei due to the valley connecting the regional minima in the inverse inner distance map
[see Fig. 10(b), (c)]. Further, the jagged watershed lines [see
Fig. 10(i)] generated by the classical marking function are usually not desirable [10]. To address these two limitations, we
propose a new marking function for the watershed algorithm,
which is calculated based on the inner distance map and the
distances between nuclei seeds and pixels in nuclei regions.
Let Ii (x, y) be a binary image containing a nuclei region Ni
and C = (C1 , C2 , . . . , CK ) be the detected nuclei seeds in this
region. The distance transform for the new marking function is
calculated as follows:
1) Calculate the Euclidean distance Dj (x , y  ) between the
jth seed Cj and the pixel (x , y  ) for all 1 ≤ j ≤ K, where
(x , y  ) ∈ Ni .
2) Calculate the inner distance transform di (x , y  ) for the
pixel (x , y  ):

di (x , y  ) = inf
(x − x)2 + (y  − y)2
(12)
(x,y )∈B i

where Bi is the background region in Ii .
3) Obtain the new depth value fi (x , y  ) for the pixel (x , y  ):
fi (x , y  ) = min {Dj (x , y  ) − di (Cj )}
j

(13)

where di (Cj ) is the depth value for the nuclei seed
Cj (1 ≤ j ≤ K) in di .
The distance map fi defined in (13) is similar to that proposed in [10], which is capable of breaking the valley connecting the regional minima caused by the inner distance transform
and avoiding the jagged watershed lines of segmented nuclei.

COMPARISON OF SEED DETECTION PERFORMANCE BETWEEN SPV ALGORITHM AND PROPOSED TECHNIQUE

Fig. 10 shows two examples of nuclei segmentation by watershed algorithm using two different marking functions. The
under-segmentation for highly overlapping nuclei is observed
in Fig. 10(c), which is obtained by using the classical marking
function in [8] with the inner distance transform [see Fig. 10(b)].
In contrast, the watershed algorithm using the proposed marking function separates the overlapping nuclei as desired [see
Fig. 10(e)]. The jaggedness of the watershed line generated by
the classical marking function is observed in Fig. 10(i), whereas
the smooth watershed line is obtained by using the proposed
marking function [see Fig. 10(k)]. The jagged contours of nuclei generated by watershed algorithm can be further alleviated
by the parameterized ellipsoidal models [11]. Assume that the
elliptical models for nuclei are mutually independent and can
be overlapped, each model can be generated by using the direct least square fitting algorithm [24] based on the boundary
points of the nucleus region. Fig. 10(f), (l) separately show nuclei segmentation with the smooth contours obtained by the
parameterized ellipsoidal models.
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS
We have evaluated the proposed technique on two databases
containing 114 different cutaneous histopathological image
patches with more than 2000 nuclei. The first database consists of images of skin epidermis mainly with isolated nuclei,
while the second database consists of images of skin dermis
mainly with nuclei clumps. The histological sections used for
image acquisition were prepared from formalin-fixed paraffinembedded tissue blocks of skin biopsies and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) by automated stainer. The test images
on average have the size of 500 × 500 pixels (pixel resolution:
0.23 μm/pixel) and were captured under 40X magnification on
Carl Zeiss MIRAX MIDI Scanning system (Carl Zeiss Inc., Germany). The major axis of a nucleus generally ranges between
40 and 70 pixels. In this section, we present the nuclei detection
and segmentation performance of the proposed technique.
A. Seed Detection Performance
To evaluate the performance of the developed seed detection
technique, the nuclei locations are manually labeled using an
interactive computer program (based on MATLAB). The marker
indicating a nucleus is recorded by the user mouse clicking
operation during the manual labeling procedure. Three examples
of image patches with nuclei markers have been shown in Fig. 1
in which the bright yellow dots indicate the manually labeled
markers for the presence of nuclei. These manually labeled

nuclei markers are taken as the ground truth annotation for
the nuclei detection performance evaluation. A nucleus seed is
considered as correctly detected if its location is within a range
of 10 pixels of the manually labeled nucleus location.
Let NP , NDS , and NTP denote the numbers of the ground
truth seeds, the detected seeds, and the true positives (i.e., correctly detected seeds) respectively. The performance is evaluated
with respect to the precision (PRE) and the sensitivity (SEN)
which are defined as follows:
PRE =

NTP
× 100%
NDS

(14)

SEN =

NTP
× 100%.

(15)

The seed detection performance of the proposed voting algorithm is compared with that of the SPV algorithm [16]. For the
both algorithm, the values of parameters rm in , rm ax , and rbw
are determined by the estimated average nuclei radius in the
database. These parameters are set to rm in = 10, rm ax = 40,
and rbw = 16 after calculating the average radius of 170 manually selected nuclei in the training database. The parameter Δ
is set as π6 which is same as that in [16]. The threshold to select
voting points (i.e., high gradient pixels) for the SPV algorithm is
empirically set as 0.035. The proposed voting algorithm detects
nuclei seeds only for nuclei clumps and nuclei with irregular
shapes, whereas the SPV algorithm is implemented to detect
nuclei seeds for all nuclei regions. To compare the performance
of these two methods, the region centers of isolated nuclei detected by the ellipse descriptor analysis are taken as nuclei seeds.
Table II shows the comparison results of two approaches tested
on two databases. It is observed that the proposed technique
achieves a superior precision and sensitivity in comparison to
the results obtained by the SPV algorithm. The poor performance for the SPV algorithm is mainly due to the inter- and
intra-intensity variations present in the test images. Simply by
setting a single threshold for the whole image database, it is difficult to obtain a good detection performance. The votes outside
nuclei regions could potentially generate false seeds. The nuclei
with blurred edges (i.e., low gradient points) cannot get votes,
and hence no seeds are detected for them.
For visual comparison, Fig. 11 shows four randomly selected
examples of seed detection results from two databases. The first
column shows the original images; the second column shows the
images overlapped with nuclei edges obtained after the initial
segmentation; the third column shows the images with nuclei
seeds obtained by the ellipse descriptor analysis; and the fourth
and fifth columns show the final seed detection results obtained

by using the proposed technique and the SPV algorithm. Note
that the marked circles with radius of 10 pixels in last two
columns are centered at the manually labeled nuclei positions. It
is observed in the last column that the SPV algorithm generates a
large number of false seeds in the background regions and misses
several seeds for the nuclei with blurred boundaries, whereas the
proposed algorithm provides more reliable and accurate seed
detection results shown in the fourth column.
B. Segmentation Performance
To illustrate the efficacy of nuclei segmentation, the performance of the proposed technique is compared with those of various watershed-based segmentation techniques including classical watershed [8], condition erosion [9], shape marker [10], and
marker optimization [11]. The results are further compared with
ones from local optimal threshold [3] and SPV+level set [16].
All the parameters of these existing methods were selected
such that the best segmentation performance is achieved on our
databases. Let NCS , NOS , and NUS be the numbers of the correct segmentation, over-segmentation, and under-segmentation.
The overall performance is evaluated using three metrics: (1)
the correct segmentation rate (CSR); (2) the over-segmentation
rate (OSR); (3) the under-segmentation rate (USR) which are
defined as:
CSR =

NCS
× 100%
NP

(16)

OSR =

NOS
× 100%
NP

(17)

USR =

NUS
× 100%
NP

(18)

where Np is the number of manually labeled ground truth.
In order to evaluate the accuracy of segmented contours,
the contours of 180 randomly selected nuclei from our two
databases are manually labeled. The pixel-wise comparison of
nuclei contours between automatic and manual segmentations
is evaluated by the mean absolute distance (MAD) metric which
is defined as follows:
N




1 
min CiGT − CjSEG  (19)
MAD C GT , C SEG =
N i=1

where C GT and C SEG are the contours of manually segmented
regions and automatic segmented regions, respectively, CiGT
and CjSEG represent the ith pixel and the jth pixel on the contours of manually segmented regions and automatic segmented
regions, respectively, and N is the total number of pixels on the
contour of a manually segmented region.
The quantitative comparison of segmentation results with different methods are presented in Table III. It is observed that
92.18% and 93.15% of the cell nuclei in two databases are correctly segmented by the proposed technique, which performs
relatively better than the marker optimization [11] and the shape
marker [10]. Both these methods detect nuclei markers by using

1738

COMPARISON OF NUCLEI SEGMENTATION PERFORMANCE BY PROPOSED TECHNIQUE AND SEVERAL EXISTING METHODS

the H-minima transform to suppress undesired local minima.
The former method [11] determines the optimal h-value based
on the hypothesis that a single nucleus has an elliptical shape, but
this assumption is not always true. The latter method [10] adaptively learns h-value using the same parameters for the whole image which makes it difficult to extract the nuclei markers. Since
the identical erosion structures and fixed thresholds are applied
for all cell nuclei regardless of their size and shapes, condition erosion [9] occasionally generates under-segmentation and
over-segmentation for nuclei clumps. The poor performance
of the repulsive level set [16] is mainly due to the incorrect
detection of nuclei seeds by the SPV algorithm. The local optimal threshold [3] achieves a good performance in database-1
(which mainly contains isolated nuclei) but a poor performance
in database-2 (which mainly contains nuclei clumps). The main
reason is that this technique is capable of separating partially
touching nuclei but fails to deal with overlapping or highly clustered nuclei. The performance of the classical watershed [8] is
much poorer than that of the other techniques, as the classical
watershed produces high over-segmentations due to many local
region minima in the distance map. It is also observed that the
MAD values for the proposed technique are the smallest in the
two databases among all compared methods. This is mainly due
to the accurate nuclei detection of the proposed technique.
Visual examples of nuclei segmentation by the proposed technique and several existing methods are shown in Fig. 12. The
first column shows the original image patches; the second column shows the manually labeled nuclei contours; the columns
(c − h) show the segmentation results obtained by the existing
methods and the last two columns show the segmentation results
obtained by the proposed technique. Note that the original image
patches in the first and second rows are selected from database1, while the original image patches in the third and fourth rows
are selected from database-2. As observed in Fig. 12, when cell
nuclei partially touch each other, the existing methods such as
in [9]–[11] are generally capable of nuclei segmentation. But
when the nuclei are severely clustered together (i.e., the third
and fourth rows in Fig. 12), the methods tend to generate undersegmentation and over-segmentation. This is mainly due to the
incorrect markers extraction of those methods. Overall, the proposed technique provides a more precise and reliable segmentation performance compared to existing techniques. In addition,
the jaggedness of nuclei contours is removed by describing the
nuclei regions with elliptical shapes.

There are three parameters that play significant roles in the
proposed technique. These are ellipticity thresholds τ1 , τ2 , and
estimated nuclei radius d (note that the parameters rm in , rm ax ,
and rbw are determined by d as defined in Algorithm 1). The
thresholds τ1 and τ2 are the average values of ellipticity parameters corresponding to isolated nuclei and nuclei clumps (see
(8) and (9)). To evaluate the sensitivity of these two parameters,
we varied τ1 by 1% and 2%, τ2 by 10% and 20% around the
calculated values (τ1 = 0.9, τ2 = 0.2), respectively. The small
variation of τ1 is selected, because a large variation may generate nonpermissible τ1 values (e.g., τ1 > e1N ). Fig. 13(a) shows
the CSRs of two databases with different (τ1 , τ2 ) values. As
observed, CSR value varies about 1.3% in database-1, and 3%
in database-2. Most nuclei in database-1 are isolated, and hence
threshold variations (e.g., τ1 = 0.88, τ2 = 0.24) have less impact on this database. To evaluate the sensitivity of the parameter
d, its value is varied by 10% and 20% around the estimated optimal value (d = 27). Fig. 13(b) shows the CSR values of two
databases with different d values. As observed, CSR value varies
about 2% for two databases. From the results in Fig. 13, it can
be concluded that the proposed technique is robust to the choice
of parameters τ2 and d. The performance is relatively more
sensitive to τ1 , as it has strong influence on the undersegmentation and oversegmentation. Therefore, an accurate choice of
the ellipticity parameters of isolated nuclei and nuclei clumps is
important.

C. Computational Complexity
To evaluate the computational complexity of the proposed
technique, the average run time of the proposed algorithm tested
on two databases is calculated and compared with that of the
existing segmentation techniques. All experiments were carried out on a 2.3-GHz Intel Core i5-3427U CPU with 4.0-GB
RAM using MATLAB 7.12. The sixth and eleventh columns of
Table III separately show the average run time t for each segmentation technique. As observed, the value of t for the SPV+level
set is highest (156.7 s and 86.8 s, respectively) and much larger
than that of the other techniques. This is primarily due to the
high complexity of the SPV algorithm [16] (which takes more
than 90% of the total time for the SPV+level technique). The
proposed technique on average takes 4.4 and 2.1 seconds per
image patch for the two databases, which are similar to the other
methods but much lower than the SPV+level set.

Our seed detection technique is initially motivated by the
SPV algorithm [16]. However, several improvements greatly
reduce the computation complexity of the voting algorithm.
First, an original color histopathological image is converted
into a binary image and nuclei regions are shrunk by the erosion
operation, and hence the proposed voting algorithm is able to
select the potential voting regions from the eroded nuclei areas rather than from the whole image. Second, most isolated
cell nuclei are efficiently detected by the ellipse descriptor analysis and avoid the unnecessary seed detection by the voting
algorithm. To further show the efficiency of each module for
the proposed technique, let us denote the first module (initial

segmentation) as the IS, the second module (ellipse descriptor analysis) as the EDA, the third module (seed detection)
as the SD and the fourth module (nuclei segmentation) as the
NS. Table IV shows the average run time required by the IS,
IS+EDA, IS+EDA+SD, and IS+EDA+SD+NS (overall proposed technique), respectively. Note that t1 is calculated from
database-1, while t2 is calculated from database-2. As observed
in Table IV, the IS module takes around 10% of the total time,
while the other three modules separately take around 30% of
the total time. Overall, the proposed technique is time efficient due to the low complexity of the improved seed detection
algorithm.

V. CONCLUSION
This paper presents an efficient computer-aided technique for
segmentation of cell nuclei in the skin histopathological images. The proposed technique first extracts the candidate nuclei
regions using an adaptive threshold technique, and then separates ellipse-like isolated nuclei using two ellipticity parameters. The seeds of clustered nuclei and nuclei with irregular
shapes are detected by an improved voting algorithm. Finally,
the undivided nuclei regions are segmented by the marked watershed algorithm with contours adjusted by the ellipsoidal model.
The evaluation on 114 skin histopathological image patches
shows that the proposed technique performs better than the
existing methods and provides a correct segmentation rate of
over 90%.
