Abstract—Ballistocardiography, the measurement of the reaction forces of the body to cardiac ejection of blood, is one of the few
techniques available for unobtrusively assessing the mechanical
aspects of cardiovascular health outside clinical settings. Recently,
multiple experimental studies involving healthy subjects and subjects with various cardiovascular diseases have demonstrated that
the ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal can be used to trend cardiac
output, contractility, and beat-by-beat ventricular function for arrhythmias. The majority of these studies has been performed with
“fixed” BCG instrumentation—such as weighing scales or chairs—
rather than wearable measurements. Enabling wearable, and thus
continuous, recording of BCG signals would greatly expand the capabilities of the technique; however, BCG signals measured using
wearable devices are morphologically dissimilar to measurements
from “fixed” instruments, precluding the analysis and interpretation techniques from one domain to be applied to the other.
In particular, the time intervals between the electrocardiogram
(ECG) and BCG—namely, the R–J interval, a surrogate for measuring contractility changes—are significantly different for the accelerometer compared to a “fixed” BCG measurement. This paper
addresses this need for quantitatively normalizing wearable BCG
measurement to “fixed” measurements with a systematic experimental approach. With these methods, the same analysis and interpretation techniques developed over the past decade for “fixed”
BCG measurement can be successfully translated to wearable
measurements.

coming decades. In 2013, CVD accounted for one in four deaths
in the U.S., and afflicted more than 1 in 3 people [1]; by 2030,
the American Heart Association (AHA) projects that 40.5%
of Americans will suffer with CVD and the projected medical
costs will exceed $800 billion [2]. At the same time, in the
coming years, there is a projected shortage in the number of
healthcare providers both in the U.S. and worldwide [3]–[5].
The combination of increasing numbers of patients with CVD,
increasing medical costs related to CVD, and decreasing number
of providers can only be addressed by dramatic changes in the
way that care is delivered [6].
Home monitoring of cardiovascular health represents a viable
alternative to the current model of reactive CVD management
[6]–[9]. Actionable solutions for physiological monitoring at
home that capture the complexity required for titrating care
could greatly reduce healthcare costs, improve the effectiveness of the therapy by better addressing the changing needs of
the patients, and empower the patients against their diseases by
enabling them with information regarding their physiological
state. These home monitoring technologies must be unobtrusive, inexpensive, accurate, and robust, and, most importantly,
must provide sufficiently comprehensive information about the
person’s health such that therapies can be adjusted based on
valid physiological relationships.
In terms of monitoring CVD at home, such a comprehensive
assessment would require information regarding both the electrical and mechanical aspects of cardiovascular function. However,
current technologies for unobtrusively assessing the mechanical aspects are greatly limited, and in general not amenable for
home use [10]. Ballistocardiography (BCG), the measurement
of the mechanical forces of the body in reaction to cardiac ejection of blood [11]–[13], has shown promise in recent studies for
offering a possible solution to this technological need. Robust
BCG measurements have been demonstrated using beds [14],
[15], chairs [16], and modified home weighing scales [13], and
were shown to correlate strongly to changes in cardiac output
[10], contractility [17], [18], and beat-by-beat left ventricular
function [13]—all three of these representing central aspects of
mechanical function.
Continuous measurement of BCG signals using a wearable
device would greatly enhance the capabilities of the technique
for assessing cardiovascular health at home. If BCG signals
were continuously obtained throughout the day and night, then
specific responses of cardiac output and contractility to perturbations such as ambient temperature [19], posture [20], activity

[21], and sleep [22] could be gathered, and a more comprehensive picture of the person’s cardiovascular health could be
obtained. Accordingly, researchers have developed wearable
systems based on miniature accelerometers to attempt to measure BCG signals continuously [23], [24]. However, since the
morphology and timing of these signals are significantly different from BCG signals measured using the weighing scale
[25], or other historical techniques such as the Starr Table [11],
the analysis and interpretation techniques developed for BCG
signals should not directly be applied to these wearable acceleration measurements. For example, while the time interval between the electrocardiogram (ECG) R-wave peak and the BCG
J-wave peak—the R–J interval—was typically 250 ms for a
healthy adult [17] measured with the static-charge-sensitive bed
apparatus, and ranged from 203–290 ms for 92 healthy subjects
participating in a study with the weighing scale system [26],
for the accelerometer-based wearable system the R–J interval
was found to be between 150–180 ms [23]. Similar results were
found by Wiard et al., with an accelerometer-based BCG system
where the R–J interval was 133 ms [27].
Cardiac timing measurements such as the R–J interval are
clinically important for a number of reasons. Calcium ions regulate contractility and relaxation of the heart, and recycling of
these ions controls the timing of cardiac events. Regulation of
calcium ions is thus critically important in mechanical dysfunction and arrhythmia [28]. Since cardiac timing exhibits millisecond precision, it is a good measure of myocardial cellular health,
and irregularities in timing measurements are generally the first
indication of problems in cardiac performance [29].
This paper builds on preliminary results from [30], and
presents a systematic approach for elucidating the relationship
between these surface vibrations of the body in the head-to-foot
direction, and the movements of the whole body as measured
by the BCG-equipped weighing scale. Additionally, a methodology is proposed for mathematically converting the wearable
acceleration signals to BCG signals such that the same analysis and interpretation tools can be used for both measurements.
Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this represents the first
high-resolution (low electronic noise) measurements of the surface accelerations of the body related to the heartbeat with a low
weight accelerometer which will minimally load the measurement in the transverse direction.
II. METHODS AND DESIGN APPROACH
A. Hardware Design and Data Collection
This study was conducted under a protocol reviewed and
approved by the Georgia Institute of Technology Institutional
Review Board. All subjects provided informed consent before
experimentation. Fifteen healthy subjects were recruited for this
study, including ten men and five women with ages ranging from
22 to 57. Similar to other studies in the existing literature, each
subject served as his or her own control since relationships
between measurements made on the same individuals were examined [31]–[33].
Fig. 1 shows the block diagram of the measurement hardware and setup, as well as representative signals measured from

one subject. As shown in Fig. 1(a), a custom circuit was built
and implanted in the modified home weighing scale (BC534,
Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) to interface to the strain
gauge bridge in the scale and measure the fluctuations in bodyweight caused by the heartbeat—the head-to-foot BCG signal. An ultralow noise integrated bridge amplifier and 24-bit
sigma-delta analog-to-digital converter (AD7191, Analog Devices, Norwood, MA, USA) was used to amplify this differential
signal from the strain gauge bridge, and the digitized output was
connected to the input port of a microcontroller (1284P, Atmel
Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA). The digitized signal, sampled at 120 Hz, was then wirelessly transmitted to the computer
using Bluetooth and stored for postprocessing and analysis. For
further details on the BCG measurement hardware the reader is
referred to previous work [13].
The ECG recordings were measured by the BN-EL50 wireless ECG measurement module (BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta,
CA, USA) with the Ag/AgCl surface electrodes configured for
a modified Lead II measurement. The ECG data were transmitted wirelessly from this module to the data acquisition system
(MP150WSW, BIOPAC Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA), where they
were sampled at 1 kHz and stored on the computer.
While the subjects stood on the weighing scale and the BCG
and ECG were recorded, the surface acceleration signals in the
head-to-foot direction were measured using a small, ultralow
noise accelerometer (356A32, PCB Piezotronics, Depew, NY,
USA) attached to various locations on the torso. This accelerometer was selected based on its low spot noise (20 μgrm s /Hz
at 10 Hz) and total noise (300 μgrm s for a bandwidth of 1–
10 000 Hz), wide signal bandwidth (0.7–5000 Hz, ±1 dB), and
its relatively small size (11.4 mm cubed) and low weight (5.4 g).
In contrast to micromachined (microelectromechanical systems,
MEMS) accelerometers used in previous studies, the self-noise
was several times lower: the LIS344ALH (ST Microelectronics, Geneva, Switzerland) accelerometer used in previous studies [24], [34] represents the lowest noise MEMS accelerometer available, with a self-noise of 350 μgrm s for a bandwidth
of 1–50 Hz compared to the 60 μgrm s for the 356A32 used
here. Compared to other instrumentation-grade accelerometers
used in previous work, the weight of our accelerometer was 8x
lower, as was the volume: the 4381 (Bruel & Kjaer, Naeurum,
Denmark) piezoelectric accelerometer used previously [35],
[36] weighs 43 g and is a 20.5 mm diameter × 23.6 mm height
cylinder compared to the 5.4 g weight and 11.4-mm-cubed dimensions of the sensor used here.
These choices of accelerometers for previous studies have
been driven by the fact that the analysis was focused primarily
on dorso-ventral components of cardiogenic surface accelerations of the torso, as compared to head-to-foot components. The
dorso-ventral components are larger in amplitude, and, due to
the measurement direction being perpendicular to the wall of
the chest, mechanical loading of the skin by the sensor would
be of less concern. Since our study focuses on head-to-foot accelerations, and the subjects are standing upright, the loading of
the skin by a heavy accelerometer would be of great concern,
as would an elevated sensor noise floor compromising the accuracy of our measurements. Based on these aspects, we argue

For this recording, the accelerometer was placed on the subject’s sternum. The time delays from the ECG R-wave to the main peak of the
acceleration and second-derivative BCG signals were identical, at 149 ms, while the time delay from the ECG R-wave to the BCG J-wave peak (R-J interval) was
228 ms, consistent with physiological expectations.

that the waveforms presented in this paper, are the closest representation of the actual surface accelerations in the head-to-foot
direction, of high-signal quality as shown in Fig. 1(b), and are
the most appropriate surface measurements for comparison to
BCG recordings from the weighing scale system.
B. BCG, ECG, and Accelerometer Signal Processing
The signal processing consisted of preprocessing for reducing
electronic noise, baseline wander, and motion artifacts in the
signals, and feature extraction from the BCG and acceleration
signals. The feature extraction operations are summarized in the
block diagram shown in Fig. 2.
The ECG signal was digitally band-pass filtered (Finite impulse response, FIR, Pass-band: 15-25 Hz, Kaiser window) to
extract the QRS complexes, then a simple automatic peak detection algorithm was employed and checked manually to find the
R-wave timings. The BCG was band-pass filtered (FIR, Passband: 0.8–15 Hz, Kaiser window) to remove baseline wander
and high-frequency noise, as was the acceleration signal (Infinite
impulse response, IIR, Pass-band: 1–15 Hz, Butterworth). Using
the R-wave peaks as a fiduciary point, the BCG and acceleration
waveforms were then segmented with a window extending from
each R-wave peak timing Ri to Ri + 700 ms. The ensemble averages were then computed from these segmented heartbeats.
The acceleration ensemble average was then double integrated
using a twice-repeated sequence of trapezoidal integration and
low-order polynomial-fitting-based baseline wander estimation
and subsequent removal. For each subject, and each location on
the torso, a normalized residual rms error was then found from
the double-integrated acceleration signal compared to the BCG,

with a scaling factor first determined based on the ratio of the
maximum absolute value amplitude of the signals; a correlation
coefficient was also computed.
The R–J interval was calculated for the weighing-scale BCG
signal by finding the elapsed time between the previous ECG
R-wave peak and the global maximum in the first 400 ms of the
BCG ensemble average. The 400-ms window was chosen based
on physiological expectations and previous values for normal
R–J intervals from the existing literature. The interval between
the ECG R-wave and the maximum peak of the vibration signal
was measured for the head-to-foot accelerometer signal, and
the double-integral of the acceleration, as follows. In our initial
observations of the double-integrated acceleration signals, we
noticed that simply using the global maximum over the full window created errors in J-wave peak detection due to the double
integration operation amplifying low-frequency noise.
One source of low-frequency noise is motion or postural sway
of the subject. It is known that the standing BCG is more prone
to noise from subject motion than stationary techniques such as
bed- and chair-based BCG methods where the subject is either
supine or seated [16], [37]. Techniques have been developed
to reduce this noise in the standing BCG using electromyogram (EMG) signals from the feet as a measure of lower body
muscle contraction and relaxation [25], [38]. Other sources of
noise affecting the measurement include low-frequency electrical noise. The low-frequency parasitic components from these
various sources were shaped by the double integration.
As a result, we created a simple algorithm to find the closest large peak to the actual BCG J peak rather than the global
maximum. To achieve this, first the indices of all local maxima
were located in the first 400 ms of the acceleration ensemble

celeration signals from several locations on the torso and head
and plotted them for visual analysis and comparison.
For all subjects, we measured the head-to-foot accelerations
at three locations—sternum, point of maximal impulse (PMI),
and lower back (center of mass, COM)—simultaneously with
the ECG and BCG. We determined the best location for each
subject based on the lowest normalized residual and the highest
correlation coefficient. We assessed the statistical significance
(at the p < 0.05 level) of the differences in both normalized
residuals and correlation coefficients for the different locations
for all subjects using Student’s t-test. For the R–J intervals,
we used Bland–Altman methods [39] to assess the agreement
between the two accelerometer-derived R–J intervals (one from
the acceleration signal itself, and one from the double-integrated
acceleration signal) and the BCG-derived “gold” standard R–J
interval. We compared the bias and confidence interval for both
of these techniques, and determined whether or not a bodyworn accelerometer combined with ECG could yield an accurate
estimate of the R–J interval.

and Timing: Results From One Subject

average. Then, the acceleration ensemble average was offset
with a positive dc bias and multiplied by a Gaussian window
function centered on the true J-wave peak. This signal was evaluated at the samples corresponding to the local maxima and the
absolute maximum among them was selected as the best estimate for the J-wave peak. In this way, the estimated J-wave peak
was located with preference first to peaks that were closest to the
true J-wave peak and then for peaks that were large. A large peak
in the acceleration signal that was slightly farther from the true
J peak will be selected over a much smaller peak closer to the
true J-wave with the width of the Gaussian window function determining the balance between peak size and distance from true
J-wave. Additionally, an analysis of these error metrics against
heart rate was performed, and no significant correlations were
found.
C. Experiments and Statistical Analysis
For one subject with representative acceleration and BCG
waveform amplitude and morphology, we measured triaxial ac-

The ensemble averaged acceleration waveforms in all three
axes—with x as lateral, y as dorso-ventral, and z as head-to-foot
directions—are shown in Fig. 3 alongside the simultaneously
acquired ECG and BCG signals for one subject. Note that the
head-to-foot acceleration is greatest at the PMI, and decreases at
the sternum and lower back. For the dorso-ventral direction, the
time delay between the ECG R-wave and the largest negative
peak in the acceleration waveform is shortest at the sternum,
and the PMI, then longest at the lower back. The recording
from the ear appears to be the smallest in terms of peak-to-peak
accelerations, and is delayed in time compared to the sternal
signal.
B. Statistical Results From All Subjects
Table I shows the normalized residual and correlation coefficient values for all subjects for the three positions. The position with the lowest residual is denoted by an asterisk (∗),
and the position with the highest correlation coefficient by a
dagger (†). The PMI was the best location in terms of lowest residual and highest correlation coefficient for only three
of the fifteen subjects; the lower back was the best location in
terms of lowest residual for three of fifteen subjects, but highest correlation coefficient for six subjects. The sternum was the
best location of the three, with significantly lower normalized
residual compared to the PMI and lower back for the overall subject population (p < 0.05). Considering only the results
from the best of three locations for all subjects, the average
(±σ) normalized residual and correlation coefficient are 0.83
(±0.22) and 0.83 (±0.07). Finally, following the trend shown in
Fig. 3 for one subject, the peak-to-peak acceleration amplitude
was significantly (p = 0.01) highest on average for all subjects
with the sensor placed at the PMI (61.3 ± 26.8 mg), then the

the minimum location occurred significantly later (p < 0.05) in
the cardiac cycle at the lower back (224.0 ± 35.8 ms) compared
to the sternum (176.2 ± 81.1 ms).
C. R–J Interval Comparisons
Fig. 4 shows three Bland–Altman plots of agreement between
the “gold” standard R–J interval measurement (the interval between the ECG R-wave and the weighing scale BCG J-wave) and
the acceleration or double-integrated acceleration waveforms
from all three locations on the body. With the accelerometer
located at the sternum or lower back, the R–J interval derived
using the double-integrated acceleration signal showed good
agreement with the weighing scale. The best location for R–
J interval estimation was found to be the lower back, with a
bias of −3.9 ms and a confidence interval of ±30 ms. Using
the acceleration waveform itself provided poor agreement with
weighing scale R–J intervals, with both a large bias and wide
confidence interval.
IV. DISCUSSION

Fig. 3. Ensemble averaged ECG and BCG (top), and triaxial acceleration
waveforms for one subject with the accelerometer placed at the sternum, PMI,
lower back (COM), and ear. All signals are shown on the same x-axis (time),
the ECG and BCG scale bars are shown for their respective amplitudes, and the
10 mg amplitude scale bar applies to all acceleration signals.

The results show that although a body-mounted accelerometer
can be used for BCG measurement, the acceleration waveform
itself should not be interpreted using standard BCG nomenclature or feature extraction techniques. Rather, a simple ensemble averaging and double integration operation can be used
to transform the acceleration waveform into a COM BCG signal, from which standard BCG feature extraction techniques can
be applied. Additionally, although accelerations measured at the
PMI have the largest amplitude—and thus the highest electronic
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)—the PMI is the worst location for
both matching the BCG signal morphology and for extracting

V. CONCLUSION

Fig. 4. Bland Altman plots showing agreement between ECG R-wave to BCG
J-wave intervals derived from the weighing scale BCG signal (“gold” standard)
compared to corresponding R–J intervals derived from the acceleration and
double-integrated acceleration waveforms measured at the sternum, PMI, and
lower back. For each location, the confidence intervals (95%) are also plotted for
each estimate, and the bias ± confidence interval are shown. The best agreement
was found in the lower back measurement, after taking the double integral
of the head-to-foot acceleration waveform. Using the acceleration waveform
itself always resulted in poorer bias and confidence interval for R–J interval
estimation.

the R–J interval feature. This reinforces the importance of
optimizing physiological sensing systems and approaches based
on the physiology and findings from human subjects studies,
rather than using engineering principles alone.
The best location for placing the accelerometer for wearable
BCG measurements is subject dependent, indicating that for
optimal results an initial calibration step may be needed. For
example, a subject could stand on the BCG-equipped weighing scale while wearing an accelerometer on the torso, and
the transfer function between the measurements could be modeled mathematically. For most measurements, the sternum is
the best location for mounting the sensor, as it produced the
lowest average residual (best morphological match) compared
to the COM BCG and accurate R–J interval feature extraction.
For applications requiring best timing precision in assessing the
R–J interval, the lower back placement should be used: this positions the accelerometer as closely as possible to the COM of
the person, thus closely mirroring the COM movements which
are measured with the scale.
Finally, these results suggest that in addition to the hemodynamic components at the origin of these low frequency (<20 Hz)
vibration signals of the torso, there are other components that
are localized at the heart: for example, the movement of the heart
itself. This has been suggested previously in the existing literature [40], and is now further reinforced by these experimental
results.

This paper presents a novel methodology that can be used
to extract clinically relevant BCG features based on acceleration measurements from different locations on the torso, and
provides promising evidence for these methods based on preliminary findings from human subjects studies. The proposed
methodology can potentially reduce some of the confusion in
the scientific community regarding the relationship between traditional “fixed” BCG measurements and wearable BCG measurements, and reiterates the importance of sensor placement
for interpreting results.
While the results of this study appear promising, a few
limitations should be mentioned. Although double integration
improved the accuracy of the R–J interval measurement, and
therefore, the measurement of changes in contractility, this
method has not been validated for patients with heart failure
or other cardiac abnormalities. Additionally, the standing BCG
method used in this study can exhibit more noise from motion
and postural sway than BCG methods for which the patient is
seated or supine. In future work, the ability to track hemodynamic and timing interval modulation during exercise or other
physiological changes will be quantified.
