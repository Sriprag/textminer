Abstract—Goal: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of the boosting algorithm AdaBoost (AB) in the context
of the sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) diagnosis. Methods: We characterize SAHS in single-channel airflow (AF) signals
from 317 subjects by the extraction of spectral and nonlinear features. Relevancy and redundancy analyses are conducted through
the fast correlation-based filter to derive the optimum set of features among them. These are used to feed classifiers based on
linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and classification and regression trees (CART). LDA and CART models are sequentially obtained through AB, which combines their performances to reach
higher diagnostic ability than each of them separately. Results:
Our AB-LDA and AB-CART approaches showed high diagnostic performance when determining SAHS and its severity. The
assessment of different apnea-hypopnea index cutoffs using an independent test set derived into high accuracy: 86.5% (5 events/h),
86.5% (10 events/h), 81.0% (15 events/h), and 83.3% (30 events/h).
These results widely outperformed those from logistic regression
and a conventional event-detection algorithm applied to the same
database. Conclusion: Our results suggest that AB applied to data
from single-channel AF can be useful to determine SAHS and its
severity. Significance: SAHS detection might be simplified through
the only use of single-channel AF data.

I. INTRODUCTION
N recent years, the sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS)
has become a major concern due to the high prevalence
and severe consequences for the patients’ health and quality of
life [1], [2]. People suffering from SAHS experiment recurrent
episodes of complete (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) collapse
of the upper airway during sleep, which lead to cessation or
significant reduction of airflow (AF) [3]. These apneic events
cause oxygen desaturations and arousals [3], preventing patients

from resting while sleeping [2]. Unsuccessful rest derives in
daytime symptoms such as hypersomnolence, cognitive impairment, and depression [1], some of which have been related
to motor-vehicle collisions and occupational accidents [4], [5].
Moreover, SAHS has been associated with cardiac and vascular illnesses [2], as well as with an increase in the cancer
incidence [6].
The standard test to diagnose SAHS is overnight in-lab
polysomnography (PSG) [3]. Although its effectiveness is well
known, PSG implies monitoring and recording multiple physiological signals, including electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), oxygen saturation of blood (SpO2 ), and AF [3]. This makes PSG a complex
test which requires expensive equipment and technical expertise [7], [8]. Moreover, the specialists need an offline inspection
of the recordings to derive the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI),
which is the parameter used to establish SAHS and its severity
[9]. Thus, PSG is also time consuming, leading to a delayed
diagnostic process and increased waiting lists [8], [10].
One widespread approach to reduce complexity, cost, and
time delay is the study of a limited set of signals among those
involved in PSG [8]. The analysis of a single one has been
often adopted. Thus, the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) from
SpO2 , the apneic-related events from ECG, and the respiratory
disturbance index (RDI) from AF have been already assessed
to help in SAHS diagnosis [10]–[13]. These works followed
a common methodology: detecting the effects caused by each
apnea and hypopnea in the signals under study, scoring them as
apneic-related events, and deriving the corresponding diagnostic
index. However, our research group has lately adopted a different
approach based on an exhaustive analysis of a signal through
the extraction of global features [14]–[18].
In this paper, we propose such a global analysis in singlechannel AF. AF is a straightforward choice to look for simpler
alternatives to PSG, since apneas and hypopneas are defined
on the basis of its amplitude oscillations [9]. The American
Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends the use of
two AF channels: one acquired through an oronasal thermal
sensor and the second one acquired by means of a nasal prong
pressure sensor (NPP) [9]. The former is suitable for a proper
scoring of apneas whereas the latter is used to score hypopneas
[9]. However, previous studies have shown that it is possible
to reach high diagnostic ability following an automatic global
analysis of the single-channel AF from a thermal sensor [17],
[18]. In this paper, one major goal is to assess whether it is
also possible to reach a high performance when using data from
single-channel AF obtained by NPP.

Our proposal starts with the extraction of spectral (frequency
domain) and non-linear (time domain) features from NPP AF.
The analysis in frequency domain is justified due to the overnight
recurrence of these events. Thereby, common spectral features
have already shown their utility to characterize SAHS as well as
other disorders [15]–[19]. On the other hand, non-linear measures of variability, complexity, and irregularity in time series
have been also used to extract useful information from biomedical signals [14], [17]–[19]. This exhaustive characterization of
AF, however, may lead to obtain features with a high degree
of shared information, i.e., redundant features. In order to avoid
this issue, a second step is included in our methodology: an automatic feature selection stage based on the fast correlation-based
filter (FCBF) [20]. The FCBF algorithm selects optimum sets
of features on the basis of their relevancy and redundancy. It has
been also assessed in biomedical applications [17], [21]. Finally,
a classification approach is used to distinguish SAHS and its
severity. Thus, we evaluate two different cases: a binary classification task, in which the objective is to determine the presence
(SAHS-positive) or absence (SAHS-negative) of SAHS, and a
multiclass task, in which the aim is to assess the AHI cutoffs
which establish the four severity levels of SAHS (no-SAHS,
mild-SAHS, moderate-SAHS, and severe-SAHS). We propose
the AdaBoost (AB) algorithm for both classification tasks. AB
is a boosting algorithm commonly used to take advantage of the
performance of several weak classifiers of the same type [22]. It
is known to be able to reach high yields when it is applied to new
data [22], i.e., the AB algorithm produces generalized models.
Moreover, it relies on a simple sequential procedure [22], which
barely increases the complexity of the methodology. These characteristics make it a suitable algorithm to be used in diagnostic
aid contexts. Actually, it has been already assessed in the context
of SAHS under a classic event-detection approach [23], [24]. As
weak classifiers we propose two well-known machine learning
algorithms based on 1) linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and
2) classification and regression trees (CART). Both of them have
been already assessed in the context of SAHS [16], [23]. Since
classifiers favor the right sorting of classes with more subjects,
one major issue in the present work is how to deal with imbalanced classes. The high prevalence of SAHS leads to prioritize
diagnosis in at-risk population [25]. Consequently, data from
SAHS patients is more available than from no SAHS subjects.
Thus, to compensate for this imbalance, we use the synthetic
minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) [26], which creates
new synthetic data from the minority classes on the basis of the
real data.
Our hypothesis is that the information obtained from AF and
the generalization ability of AB can be useful to automatically
detect SAHS and establish its severity. Thus, the main objective
of the present work is to evaluate the diagnostic usefulness
of AB when the only source of SAHS-related information is
single-channel AF from NPP. In order to achieve this goal, we
evaluate whether our proposal outperforms the diagnostic ability
of a typical classification algorithms such as logistic regression
(LR), which is based on one single classifier. We also apply to
our AF recordings an algorithm focused on the classical eventdetection approach, which has been previously assessed in other

other recent studies focused on SAHS detection from singlechannel AF.
II. POPULATION AND SIGNAL UNDER STUDY
In this study, AF recordings from 317 adults were involved.
Before undergoing PSG, all of the subjects suffered from common symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, nocturnal choking and awakenings, and/or referred apneic events.
PSG was conducted in the sleep unit of the Hospital Universitario Rı́o Hortega in Valladolid, Spain. Physicians scored apneas
and hypopneas according to the AASM rules [9]. Consequently,
an apnea was defined as a 90% or more reduction in the preevent
baseline of the AF amplitude, measured through an oronasal
thermal sensor. In contrast, a hypopnea was scored after 30%
or more reduction in the preevent baseline of the AF amplitude,
measured through a nasal pressure sensor, and accompanied by
a drop of 3% in SpO2 and/or an EEG arousal. In both cases,
duration of 10 s or more was required to annotate the event
[9]. All the subjects gave their informed consent and the Ethics
Committee of the Hospital Universitario Rio Hortega (Spain)
accepted the protocol.
Common AHI cutoffs to determine SAHS and its severity are
5, 10, 15, and 30 e/h [9], [10], [13], [17]. Particularly, SAHS
severity levels are: no-SAHS (5 < AHI), mild-SAHS (5 ࣘ AHI
< 15), moderate-SAHS (15 ࣘ AHI < 30), and severe-SAHS
(AHI > 30) [28]. Alternatively, AHI = 10 e/h has been widely
used as cutoff to determine the presence or absence of SAHS
[10], [13], [17], [18], [29]. Consequently, for the binary classification task, we chose AHI = 10 e/h to distinguish SAHSnegative and SAHS-positive subjects, whereas for the multiclassification task, we divided our database according to the
four SAHS severity levels. Tables I and II show clinical and
demographical data of the subjects under study when they are
divided for the binary or the multiclass tasks, respectively. No
statistically significant differences were found (p-value > 0.01)

between SAHS-positive and SAHS-negative (Mann–Whitney
U test), or among the four severity levels (Kruskal–Wallis test),
in body mass index (BMI) and age.
The AF recordings were obtained during overnight PSG,
which was performed through a polysomnograph (E-series,
Compumedics). An NPP sensor was used to acquire AF (sample
rate = 128 Hz). The recording length was 7.4 ± 0.3 h (mean
± standard deviation). An antialiasing filter was applied to the
AF recordings to satisfy the Nyquist–Shannon theorem. We also
applied an infinite impulse response Butterworth low-pass filter
(cutoff = 1.2 Hz) to reduce noise for a prospective nonlinear
analysis in time domain.
We divided our recordings into a training set (60%) and a
test set (40%). A uniformly random selection was conducted to
assign the AF recordings to each one. However, for the sake of
the balance of the classes in the training set, we fixed the size of
each class as follows: 29 no-SAHS subjects, 54 mild-SAHS, 54
moderate-SAHS, and 54 severe-SAHS. This distribution in the
multiclass problem leads to 75 SAHS-negative and 116 SAHSpositive for the binary classification task. The SMOTE algorithm
was used to compensate the remaining imbalance in classes of
the training set (see section III-F). The recordings not selected
for the training set were assigned to the test set.
III. METHODS
Our methodology consists of three steps. First, a feature extraction stage is implemented, in which spectral and nonlinear
analyses are conducted over the AF recordings. Then, an automatic feature selection is performed to obtain an optimum
set of the extracted features. Finally, a boosting classification
approach is adopted to determine SAHS (binary classification)
and its severity (multiclass task). Fig. 1 depicts a block diagram
with the entire methodology followed during the study, which
is widely explained in next sections.
A. Feature Extraction
1) Spectral Analysis: Apneas and hypopneas recurrently
modify AF throughout the night. This behavior supports its
study in the frequency domain. Hence, the power spectral density (PSD) of each AF recording was estimated. Welch’s method
was applied for this purpose since it is suitable for nonstationary
signals [30]. A Hamming window of 215 points (50% overlap),
along with a discrete Fourier transform of 216 points, were used
to compute PSD. To avoid the influence of factors not related
to the pathophysiology of SAHS, each PSD was normalized
(PSDn) dividing the amplitude value at each frequency by their
corresponding total power [31]. Fig. 2(a) shows the averaged
PSDn for the four SAHS severity groups in the training set.
A spectral band of interest (BW) was defined between
0.025 Hz and 0.050 Hz [see Fig. 2(b)]. This corresponds to
events lasting from 20 to 40 s, which has been reported as
the typical range of the apneic events duration [32]. Moreover,
BW is consistent with the bands found through statistical approaches [17], [18]. Thus, to characterize SAHS, nine spectral
features were extracted from the 0.025–0.050 Hz band of each
PSDn: minimum amplitude (mA), maximum amplitude (MA),

the study.

first to fourth statistical moments (Mf 1 − Mf 4 ), median frequency (MF), spectral entropy (SpecEn), and Wootters distance
(WD).
mA and MA were computed as the lowest and the highest
PSDn values in BW. Since PSD is normalized, the amplitude
values of the original AF time series do not affect the power at
each frequency component. Hence, as BW is related to apneic
events, mA and MA estimate the minimum and the maximum
occurrence of them. Mean (Mf 1 ), standard deviation (Mf 2 ),
skewness (Mf 3 ), and kurtosis (Mf 4 ) of BW were also obtained.
They are common statistics that quantify central tendency, dispersion, asymmetry, and peakedness of data, respectively. According to Fig. 2(b), mA and MA should be higher as SAHS
worsens. Similarly, the mean (Mf 1 ) and the standard deviation
(Mf 2 ) should be also higher. Finally, both the skewness (Mf 3 )
and the peakedness (Mf 4 ) seem to be higher in the BW spectral
data of moderate and severe groups.
MF is defined as the frequency component that separates the
spectrum into two parts with 50% of the power each of them
[33]. Thus, the lower the MF value, the more comprised is
the spectrum into small frequencies. As seen in Fig 2(b), the
spectrum of BW for the no-SAHS and mild-SAHS groups is
flat, i.e., the power is equally distributed. Conversely, a fewer

set and b) detail of the band of interest BW.

amount of power is observed in higher frequencies of BW for
moderate-SAHS and severe-SAHS groups. As a consequence,
an MF value closer to 0.0375 (the half of the band) is expected
for the lowest severity degrees.
SpecEn quantifies the flatness of the PSD content, which indirectly measures the irregularity of time series [33]. Thereby,
high values of SpecEn are related to a flat PSD (similar to white
noise), and consequently, it is associated with more irregularity
in time domain. By contrast, low values imply a spectrum condensed into a narrow frequency band, which is related to less
irregularity in time domain (like in a sum of sinusoids) [33]. A
flatter spectrum is observed in BW as SAHS severity decreases.
Therefore, higher values of SpecEn are expected in no-SAHS
and mild-SAHS groups.
WD is a disequilibrium measure that assigns values close to
1 to those distributions with higher statistical distance to the
uniform distribution; whereas values close to zero are assigned
as the distance becomes smaller [34], [35]. In BW, the averaged
spectrum of the no-SAHS and mild-SAHS groups is similar to
a normal distribution [see Fig. 2(b)]. Hence, smaller values of
WD are expected than in the case of the moderate-SAHS and
severe-SAHS groups.
2) Nonlinear Analysis: Alterations caused by SAHS in AF
could modify the variability, the complexity, and the irregularity of the signal. Hence, to complement the spectral analysis,

639

three global nonlinear features were also obtained from each
recording in time domain: central tendency measure (CTM),
Lempel–Ziv complexity (LZC), and sample entropy (SampEn).
Similarly to PSD, each AF time series was normalized before
obtaining CTM, LZC, and SampEn. Thereby, measuring effects
caused by factors not related to the pathophysiology of SAHS
are avoided. We first eliminated the spurious values of the signal.
Then, the time series were divided by the remaining maximum
absolute value in order to constrain each recording into the range
–1, 1.
CTM quantifies the variability of a given series x[n] on the
basis of its first-order differences [36]. These are plotted following x[n + 2] − x[n + 1] vs. x[n + 1] − x[n] [37]. The value of
CTM is computed as the proportion of points in the plot, which
fall within a radius ρ [36], which acts as a design parameter.
Thus, CTM ranges between 0 and 1, with higher values corresponding to points more concentrated around the center of
the plot, i.e., corresponding to less degree of variability. People suffering from SAHS experiment continuous changes in the
respiratory pattern (apneic events, snoring, choking, respiratory
overexertion after apneas and hypopneas), which may add variability to the AF signal. Consequently, it is expected that CTM
decreases in the presence of SAHS.
LZC estimates the complexity of a finite sequence of symbols [38]. Hence, the first step of the algorithm is to convert
a time series x[n] into such a sequence [37]. Usually, a binary
transformation is performed, with the median of each x[n] being used as threshold [37]. Then, the sequence is scanned, and
a counter c(n) is increased with every new subsequence of consecutive symbols. Finally, c(n) is normalized in order to make
the method independent of the sequence length. The higher the
value of LZC, the higher the complexity of the corresponding
time series is [37]. Abnormalities in the AF pattern may introduce new subsequences of symbols. Hence, more complexity is
expected in the AF of SAHS patients.
SampEn is a measure of the irregularity in time series [39].
It was developed by Richman and Moorman to reduce the bias
caused by self-matching in the estimation of the approximate
entropy [40]. SampEn divides a time series into consecutive
vectors of length m. It assesses whether the maximum absolute
distance between the corresponding components of each pair
of vectors is less than or equal to a tolerance r, i.e., if the vectors match each other within r. If so, the vectors are considered
as similar. Then, the same process is repeated for vectors of
length m+1 and the conditional probability that similar vectors
of length m remain similar when the length is m+1 is computed.
The final SampEn value is obtained as the negative logarithm
of such a conditional probability [39], [40]. Thus, higher values of SampEn indicate less self-similarity in the times series,
and consequently, more irregularity [39]. SAHS is reflected in
the AF signal by the addition of not regular events. As a consequence, it is expected that SampEn present higher values in
SAHS patients.
B. Feature Selection: Fast Correlation-Based Filter
The exhaustive characterization of the AF signal may lead
to the extraction of several features that provide similar

640

information about SAHS, i.e., which are redundant. Hence,
a feature selection stage is included to discard those features
(Xi ), which share more information with the others than with a
SAHS-related-dependent variable, Y. The FCBF has shown its
utility in previous studies involving SAHS [17], as well as other
biomedical applications [21]. In our case, Y is a vector whose
components are the AHI value of each subject.
FCBF relies on symmetric uncertainty (SU), which is a normalized quantification of the information gain (IG) between two
variables [20]. It consists of two steps. In the first one, a relevance analysis of the features (Xi ) is done. Thus, SU between
each feature Xi and Y is computed as follows:


IG(Xi |Y )
SU (Xi , Y ) = 2
i = 1, 2, ..., F
(1)
H(Xi ) + H(Y )
where IG(Xi |Y ) = H(Xi ) − H(Xi |Y ), H is the well-known
Shannon’s entropy, and F is the number of features extracted
(F = 12). SU is constrained to 0–1. A 0 value indicates that
the two variables are independent, whereas SU = 1 indicates
that knowing one feature it is possible to completely predict
the other [20]. Thus, the higher the value of SU, the more information shares the corresponding feature with the AHI, and
consequently, the more relevant is. Then, a ranking of features is
done based on their SU (Xi , Y ) values, i.e., from most relevant
to least relevant. The second step is a redundancy analysis in
which the SU between each pair of features (SU (Xi , Xj )) is
sequentially estimated beginning from the first-ranked ones. If
SU (Xi , Xj ) ≥ SU (Xi , Y ), with Xi being more highly ranked
than Xj , the feature j is discarded due to redundancy and is not
considered in next comparisons [20]. The optimum features are
those not discarded when the algorithm ends.
C. Classification Approach: Boosting
After the feature selection procedure, each subject from our
database is associated with a vector xk (k = 1, 2, . . . , N, where
N is the size of our sample), whose components are the values
of the features included in the optimum set. The purpose is to
build models with the ability to determine SAHS and its severity
on the basis of the information contained in the vectors xk .
Boosting procedures are known to achieve good generalization
ability [22]. Thus, 60% of the instances are used as training set
(Ntraining = 191) to feed the boosting method AB, which we
use along with LDA and CART as weak classifiers (AB-LDA
and AB-CART). The remaining 40% (Ntest = 126) is used as
test group to validate the models. For comparison purposes, we
also train a classic logistic regression (LR) classifier.
1) AB Algorithm: Boosting procedures are iterative algorithms designed to combine models that complement one another [22]. Such a combination is conducted on the basis of
weighted votes from classifiers of the same type [22], [41]. AB
is a widely used boosting algorithm, originally developed by
Freund and Schapire [42], which can be used along with any
classifier [22]. However, if AB is applied to complex classifiers,
the prediction ability on new data may be significantly decreased
[22], i.e., its generalization ability may be lost. Thus, simpler

procedures known as weak classifiers are preferable [22]. In our
case, we chose the well-known LDA and CART algorithms to
act as weak classifiers.
At each m iteration, the AB algorithm assigns a weight, wkm ,
to every instance (or vector) xk in the training set. Thus, the
mth weak classifier is trained using the corresponding weighted
instances. Then, its performance is assessed through an error εm .
This error is used to determine the weighted vote, αm , of this
mth classifier [22]. Thereby, those classifiers with smaller εm
contribute more to the final decision. At the end of the iteration,
the weights of the misclassified instances are updated (wkm +1 )
[22]. Then, the weights of all instances are normalized in order
to maintain the original distribution [42].
Two versions of AB have been implemented in this study:
AB.M1, for binary classification, and AB.M2 for the multiclass
task. Both of them rely on reweighting those instances, which
have been misclassified after each iteration. Thus, the weak
classifier trained during the next iteration gives more importance
to these instances [42], being more likely to classify them rightly
[22]. The main difference between AB.M1 and AB.M2 is how
the error ε is defined. For AB.M1, εm is the sum of the weights
of the misclassified instances in a given iteration m, divided by
the sum of the total weights of all instances at that iteration.

By contrast, a weighted pseudoloss is defined in the case of

where c is a categorical variable representing the multiple
classes, ctrue refers to the actual class of xk , and hm is the
confidence of the prediction of the weak learner for an instance
xk and a class from c.
AB.M1 and AB.M2 perform the final classification task by
returning the class with the highest sum of the votes from all
classifiers, taking into account the weight of their corresponding
predictions αm computed as follows [42]:
αm = ln (βm )

(4)

where βm is defined as (1 − εm )/εm . Additionally, the shrinkage regularization technique has been proposed to minimize
overfitting [43]. It is based on adding a learning rate υ to the
iterative process by redefining βm as (βm )υ , where υ ranges
0−1 and has to be experimentally estimated.
Two criteria were used to stop the AB.M1 algorithm: 1) εm
does not belong to the interval (0, 0.5) [22] or 2) the number of
weak learners is not higher than 400 (to minimize the overfitting chances). In the case of AB.M2, only the second criterion
was applied since the first one is considered too restrictive for
multiclass approaches [42].

D. Logistic Regression and Conventional Approach Algorithm
We also implemented LR models and a conventional eventdetection algorithm to evaluate them using our own database.
LR is a widely used supervised learning algorithm, which
has become a standard for binary classification tasks [44]. It
estimates the posterior probability that a given instance (or vector) xk belongs to one of two classes. First, the LR algorithm
uses the maximum likelihood estimation of the coefficients of
a linear transformation where the dependent variables are the
components of each xk [44], in our case, features extracted from
the signals. Then, the well-known logit function is applied to
this linear transformation in order to obtain the aforementioned
probability [44]. Vector xk is then assigned to the class with the
highest posterior probability.
We also implemented a conventional scoring algorithm in
order to apply it to our AF recordings database. Thus, a peak
detection algorithm was used to locate inspiratory onsets and
endings in AF time series [45]. The difference between AF values in consecutive onsets and endings locations determined the
amplitude of every inspiration. According to the rules of the
AASM, the algorithm scored those respiratory events, which
meet with 1) a drop of 30% or more from the AF preevent
baseline and 2) the drop lasts 10 s or more [9]. The baseline
was computed as the mean amplitude of the s previous inspirations [27]. Hence, s was a design parameter. Once all events are
scored, the total amount of them is divided by the sleep time to
obtain an AHI estimation. To choose an optimum s value, we
computed the AHI estimations of the subjects in the training
group, with s ranging 1–10. For each s, the Spearman’s correlation was computed between the corresponding AHI estimations
and the actual AHI from the subjects. The highest correlation
was obtained for s = 6, which was established as the optimum
value.
E. Statistical Analysis
The extracted features did not pass the Lilliefors normality
test. Hence, the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test was used
to establish significant statistical differences between the four
groups of SAHS severity (p-value < 0.01). Bonferroni correction was applied to deal with multiple comparisons. Diagnostic ability of the AB and LR models was assessed in terms
of sensitivity (Se, percentage of positive subjects rightly classified), specificity (Sp, percentage of negative subjects rightly
classified), accuracy (Acc, overall percentage of subjects rightly
classified), and Cohen’s kappa (κ). κ measures the agreement
between predicted and observed classes, avoiding the part of
agreement by chance [22].
The bootstrap 0.632 algorithm [22], which was only applied
to the training group, was used to find an optimum learning rate
υ for the AB models. Thus, B new bootstrap training groups
(Btraining ), with the same size as the original one, were built
by resampling with replacement from this [46]. We chose B =
500 since it suffices for a proper estimation of the error, while
let the variance remain low [46]. A uniform probability was
used to select from the original instances in the training group.
Consequently, some of these instances were repeated for each

641

new Btraining , whereas the same number remained unemployed.
The latter were used as the corresponding bootstrap test groups
(Btest ). We evaluated υ in the range (0, 1] (step = 0.1). At each
step, we computed κn (n = 1, 2, . . . , B) as follows [22]:
κn = 0.369 · κnB training + 0.632 · κnB test

(5)

where κnB training and κnB test are the Cohen’s kappa values for
each Btraining and Btest , respectively. Then, the 500 κn statistics
were averaged in each step, and υ was chosen according to the
highest κ averaged value.
F. Balancing the Classes: SMOTE
Before training the classifiers, we applied SMOTE to compensate the imbalance among classes. SMOTE creates new synthetic instances on the basis of the available minority class real
ones [26]. In our case, the real instances are the vectors of features associated to each subject in this minority class. According
to the number of new instances (vectors) required for the compensation of the classes, the algorithm selects the K-nearest
neighbors of each of the real ones [26]. Thus, if it is required
to double the minority class vectors, K should be 1, and so
on. Then, the difference between each vector and its K-nearest
neighbors is computed. These differences, multiplied by a random number in the range 0 to 1, are subsequently, added to the
original vector again, to form new synthetic ones whose components are between the vector considered and its corresponding
K-nearest neighbors [26].
As it can be derived from Table II, our instances of features,
xk , come from: 39 no-SAHS, 92 mild-SAHS, 70 moderateSAHS, and 116 severe-SAHS. These were divided into a training (60%) and a test set (40%). Since the training set plays the
key role to avoid the bias toward majority classes [26], we adjusted its configuration to balance the classes as much as possible. Hence, although the inclusion of instances into the training
set was uniformly random per class, we forced to include 29
no-SAHS, 54 mild-SAHS, 54 moderate-SAHS, and 54 severe
SAHS. Then, we applied SMOTE (K = 1) to the instances of
the no-SAHS class to create 29 additional synthetic ones. Consequently, the balanced training set was finally composed of 58
no-SAHS, 54 mild-SAHS, 54 moderate-SAHS, and 54 severe
SAHS. Accordingly, the test set was composed of 10 no-SAHS,
38 mild-SAHS, 16 moderate-SAHS, and 62 severe-SAHS.
This instance distribution, carried out for the four classes, also
resulted in a balanced training set for the binary classification
task. Thus, it was composed of 104 SAHS-negative instances
(75 real and 29 synthetic) and 116 SAHS-positive instances (all
real). The test set was composed of 35 SAHS-negative instances
and 91 SAHS-positive instances.

series. In the case of ρ, the range was chosen according to the
character of data [36]. Thus, values of ρ < 0.001 were discarded
since they led to a CTM value ࣈ 0 regardless the SAHS severity
group of the subjects. Similarly, values of ρ > 0.1 were also not
considered since they led to CTM values = 1 for every subject.
The ranges of m and r were suggested by Pincus (2001) as those
that experimentally produced a good entropy estimation in time
series longer than 60 samples [47]. We chose those configurations (ρ = 0.05 for CTM and m = 2 and r = 0.1∗ SD for SampEn
) for which the corresponding CTM and SampEn values showed
the highest Spearman’s correlation with the variable composed
of the AHI measures from the subjects. We only used training
data for this purpose. Table III shows the values of the extracted
features for the SAHS severity levels in the training set (mean
± SD only from the real instances), along with the corresponding p-values. Four out of the nine spectral features (MA, mA,
Mf 1 , and Mf 2 ), as well as CTM, showed statistical significant
differences among classes after the Bonferroni correction (pvalue < 0.01). These spectral features showed higher values as
the SAHS severity increased. An opposite tendency was shown
by CTM values. Thus, the variability also increased with the
severity of SAHS.
The FCBF was also applied to the training set (only real instances). According to FCBF, the ranking of the 12 extracted
features, from higher to lower SU values, was: Mf 1 , MA, CTM,
mA, Mf 2 , WD, SpecEn, MF, Mf 4 , LZC, Mf 3 , and SampEn.
Then, WD was found redundant with Mf 2 ; and Mf 3 with MF.
Hence, the final FCBF optimum set was composed of ten features, seven from BW (Mf 1 , MA, mA, Mf 2 , SpecEn, MF, and
Mf 4 ) and three from the nonlinear analysis (CTM, LZC, and
SampEn).
B. Classification
1) Model Selection and Training: The AB binary models
(AB-LDA2 and AB-CART2 ) were selected according to the optimum υ value. Fig. 3 displays the corresponding averaged κ
values for each υ after the bootstrap 0.632 algorithm. As mentioned earlier, this procedure was only applied to the training set.
The maximum values of κ for AB-LDA2 and AB-CART2 (0.602
and 0.713, respectively) were reached at υ = 0.1 and υ = 0.6.

Fig. 3. Optimum υ configuration for AB-LDA2 and AB-CART2 (obtained
after bootstrap process).

Then, the whole original training set was used along with these
υ values to train the AB-LDA2 and AB-CART2 models. ABLDA2 ended after 53 iterations (ε54 ࣙ 0.5). Hence, 53 LDA
models were taken into account for the final classification task.
AB-CART2 reached the limit of learners established. Therefore,
it was assessed in the bootstraps sets with more weak learners
(500–1000). No improvement in κ was reached. Consequently,
the weighted votes of 400 CART models were used for the
classification.
For the case of the AB multiclass models (AB-LDA4 and ABCART4 ), we optimized both the learning rate and the number
of learners (up to 400) during the bootstrap procedure. Hence,
for each value of υ between 0 and 1 (step = 0.1) we varied the
number of weak learners from 1 to 400 (step = 10) in order to
compute κ. Fig. 4 displays the values of κ as a function of υ
and the number of weak learners. For AB-LDA4 , the optimum
values were υ = 1 along with 110 weak learners, whereas for
AB-CART4 , were υ = 0.8 and 160 weak learners.
2) Performance of the Models: Table IV shows the diagnostic ability of the binary models (test set). The highest values
for Acc and κ are shown in bold. AB-CART2 outperformed the
other models in Se, Acc, and κ, as well as reached the highest Sp along with LR. These results show its higher diagnostic

performance. AB-LDA2 also improved the results from the classic event-detection algorithm and LR. However, the latter was
more specific. Additionally, AB-LDA2 and AB-CART2 widely
improved the performance of single models based on LDA and
CART (LDA2 and CART2 ).
The lowest performance was reached by the algorithm based
on the event-detection approach.
In the multiclass task, Table V displays the confusion matrices
of each model, i.e., the model class estimation for each subject
versus their actual SAHS severity group. Notice that, since it is
a binary classifier, LR was evaluated following the one versus
all strategy [41]. The overall accuracy (main diagonal) of the
models and the event-detection algorithm was low in test set:
event-detection 39.7%, LR 57.4%, AB-LDA4 60.3% (47.6%
in the case of a single LDA4 model), and AB-CART4 57.4%
(54.8% in the case of a single CART4 model). Classification
of mild and moderate subjects was particularly poor for all
the models. In contrast to the overall accuracy, the diagnostic
performance increases when assessing the predictions of the
models in each of the AHI severity cutoffs (5 e/h, 15 e/h, and
30 e/h). Table VI displays such performance for the multiclass
models and the event-detection algorithm. Consistent with the
overall accuracy, κ values are low. However, high diagnostic
accuracies are reached by AB-LDA4 and AB-CART4 . They
outperformed LR and the event-detection algorithm in terms
of Acc and κ when assessing the three AHI cutoffs. Finally,
AB-LDA4 widely improved the overall performance of single
LDA4 , as well as the Acc for each AHI cutoff. AB-CART4 also
improved the overall performance of CART4 , as well as the Acc

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this paper, new methodologies to help in SAHS diagnosis
have been proposed. Binary and multiclass AB models, composed of LDA and CART classifiers, have been evaluated to
distinguish SAHS and its severity. Their performances were
compared with a conventional approach (event-detection algorithm) and the classic LR classifier, both of them applied to our
own database. AB outperformed these, showing high diagnostic
ability.
Spectral and nonlinear data, extracted from single-channel
AF from NPP, were the only source of SAHS-related information used to feed the models. The spectral analysis showed
significantly higher spectral power (Mf 1 ) and power spectral
density (MA and mA) in the 0.025–0.050 Hz. frequency band as
SAHS severity increased. Since we normalized the PSD values,
these measures are related to a higher occurrence of the apneic
events, and not with their amplitude. This supports these features
as SAHS severity dependents. Dispersion (Mf 2 ) in the PSDn
values at BW was also significantly higher as SAHS worsened, suggesting a more heterogeneous occurrence of apneic
events throughout the frequencies within BW. Finally, the nonlinear analysis showed significantly higher variability (lower
CTM values) when SAHS severity increased. This is consistent with our initial assumption that the more severe SAHS the
more changes in the respiratory pattern, and consequently, the
higher variability in AF. These five features were selected by
FCBF. Although Mf 2 , SpecEn, MF, LZC, and SampEn did not
show discriminative power to distinguish SAHS severity, they
were also automatically chosen, suggesting their usefulness by
providing complementary information. Moreover, spectral and
nonlinear features were included in the ten-feature FCBF optimum set, which indicates that one analysis complement the
other, as suggested in previous studies involving AF from the
thermistor [17], [18].
AB-CART2 achieved the highest Acc and κ values for the binary (AHI cutoff = 10 e/h) classification task (86.5% Acc, 0.672

κ). In the multiclass classification, AB-LDA4 obtained 86.5%,
81.0%, 82.5% Acc for 5 e/h, 15 e/h, and 30 e/h, respectively, as
well as κ = 0.432. It is worth noting that both AB-LDA4 and
AB-CART4 reached high statistics when evaluating 5 and 30
e/h. They outperformed the LR models, the single-model LDA
and CART classifiers, as well as the event-detection algorithm.
These cutoffs are particularly important. AHI = 5 e/h draws the
line for the lower degree of SAHS. Furthermore, AHI = 30 e/h,
which establish the boundary for the highest SAHS severity,
has been associated with mortality [48], as well as suffices to
recommend a treatment even in the absence of other symptoms
[49]. In this regard, and according to Table V, 46 out of the
52 subjects (88.5%) that the AB-LDA4 ensemble predicted as
severe-SAHS were rightly classified, whereas the remaining 6
(11.5%) were mild- or moderate-SAHS, at least. Similarly, 50
out of the 59 subjects (84.7%) that the AB-CART4 ensemble
predicted as severe were indeed severe, with 0 subjects from the
no-SAHS group falling within this class.
Table VII summarizes performances from previous works
focused on the use of single-channel AF from NPP to help
in SAHS diagnosis [10], [13], [50]–[52]. All studies, except
the present one, adopted an event detection approach. When
assessing AHI = 10 e/h, only Wong et al. achieved higher diagnostic performance than AB-CART2 [10], [51]. However, a
small sample size was used to evaluate their proposals. Nakano
et al. detected apneic events in AF with the help of spectral
analysis [50]. They reported higher Se (97.0%) but lower Sp
(76.0%). Unfortunately, some data about the population under
study, required to complete the comparison, were not reported
by the authors. None of the studies, outperformed our AB-LDA4
model (86.5% Acc) in the assessment of AHI = 5 e/h. However,
Nakano et al. reported significantly higher Se (97.0%) [50]. Additionally, BaHammam et al. and Nigro et al. exhibited higher
diagnostic ability when assessing AHI = 30 e/h [13], [52].

Nonetheless, their databases were composed of 95 and 90 subjects, respectively, in contrast to the 317 subjects involved in
our study. Finally, all the studies performed similarly to our
AB-LDA4 model (81.0% Acc) when evaluating AHI = 15 e/h.
Despite we have shown the utility of our proposal, some limitations need to be addressed. Although our sample is large (317
subjects), analyzing more recordings would enhance the statistical power of our results. Particularly, a more balanced proportion of the classes would be desirable for the sake of the model
training. Nonetheless, our sample reflects a realistic proportion among the people who undergo the PSG test. Additionally,

we applied the SMOTE technique to our data in order to compensate the imbalance. The single use of NPP to acquire AF may
be another limitation. The AASM recommends using both NPP
and thermistor for a proper quantification of the number of apneas and hypopneas [9]. However, our proposal does not rely on
a classic event-detection approach. In this regard, previous studies of our research group showed high diagnostic ability when
evaluating data from single-channel AF acquired through a thermistor [17], [18]. Our current proposal has shown that using AF
data from NPP is also possible in order to reach a high diagnostic
performance. Another limitation arises regarding the redundant
information removed by the FCBF algorithm. The features discarded share more information with the selected ones than with
the AHI. However, the features selected might still share information with the others to some extent. The training time of the
AB models is another limitation if we compare it with simpler
methodologies such as logistic regression. However, once the
models are trained, the runtime after they are applied to new data
is trivial. Finally, since we propose an automatic procedure with
potential to reach diagnosis in few minutes after data collection,
it would be of great interest if future works could address the
assessment of our methodology embedded in a diagnostic test
at patient’s home. It would be also interesting the implementation and assessment of a multiclass logistic-regression-based
AB algorithm.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the
AB algorithm is used along with spectral and nonlinear features
from single-channel AF to help in SAHS diagnosis. Our AB proposals for binary and multiclass classification outperformed the
classic LR as well as a conventional event-detection algorithm,
both of them applied to our own database. The new AB-CART2
and AB-LDA4 models achieved high diagnostic ability compared with the state of the art. Additionally, we showed that it
is possible to achieve high diagnostic ability by the use of spectral and nonlinear data from NPP AF. These results highlight
the usefulness of our proposal when detecting SAHS and its
severity.
