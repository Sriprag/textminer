Abstract—The degradation behavior of a tissue adhesive is critical to its ability to repair a wound while minimizing prolonged
inflammatory response. Traditional degradation tests can be expensive to perform, as they require large numbers of samples.
The potential for using magnetoelastic resonant sensors to track
bioadhesive degradation behavior was investigated. Specifically,
biomimetic poly (ethylene glycol)- (PEG-) based adhesive was
coated onto magnetoelastic (ME) sensor strips. Adhesive-coated
samples were submerged in solutions buffered at multiple pH levels
(5.7, 7.4 and 10.0) at body temperature (37 °C) and the degradation behavior of the adhesive was tracked wirelessly by monitoring the changes in the resonant amplitude of the sensors for over
80 days. Adhesive incubated at pH 7.4 degraded over 75 days,
which matched previously published data for bulk degradation
behavior of the adhesive while utilizing significantly less material
(∼103 times lower). Adhesive incubated at pH 10.0 degraded within
25 days while samples incubated at pH 5.7 did not completely degrade even after 80 days of incubation. As expected, the rate of
degradation increased with increasing pH as the rate of ester bond
hydrolysis is higher under basic conditions. As a result of requiring a significantly lower amount of samples compared to traditional
methods, the ME sensing technology is highly attractive for fully
characterizing the degradation behavior of tissue adhesives in a
wide range of physiological conditions.
Index Terms—Biodegradation, magnetoelastic sensor, mussel

I. INTRODUCTION
ISSUE adhesives are universally applied in surgeries [1]–
[3]. The ability to control the degradation rate of the adhesive is critical to the success of its application. The adhesive
needs to maintain its mechanical integrity to prevent premature rupture of the repaired wound. However, the prolonged
presence of the adhesive can act as a barrier for the union of the
wound edges. Thus, the rate of degradation for an adhesive must
be tailored to match the rate of tissue ingrowth as the wound
heals.

While the pH of oxygenated blood and internal organs ranges
from 7.2 to 7.45 [4], [5], the pH levels of skin (pH = 4 − 6) [6],
subcutaneous tissues (pH = 6.7–7.1) [7], tumor tissues (pH <
6.9) [8], and internal tissues after prolonged hemorrhage (pH <
7) [9], [10] are more acidic. Therefore, there is a need to characterize the degradation behavior of tissue adhesives under
multiple conditions to better mimic various physiological environments. This requires a significant number of sets of experiments to characterize a sample. Unfortunately, today the typical
characterization of the degradation behavior for tissue adhesives
still involves tracking the mass loss of the adhesive over time
[11], [12], which utilizes a large amount of sample. The need for
a large quantity of material required for traditional degradation
testing makes it cost prohibitive to conduct comprehensive studies to evaluate the effects of multiple factors on the degradation
behavior of bioadhesives. Additionally, these experiments are
performed under simulated physiological conditions and may
not reflect the complex environment and foreign body response
that an adhesive would experience in the body. Currently, no
accurate methods exist for quantitatively monitoring the in vivo
biodegradation behavior of tissue adhesives.
Recently, we reported the use of magnetoelastic (ME) sensors to track the degradation behavior of a fast degrading tissue
adhesive over a period of several hours [13]. ME sensors are
made of magnetoelastic materials, such as Metglas 2826MB
(Fe40 Ni38 Mo4 B18 ). Due to their large magnetoelastic coupling
factor (∼0.98) and a magnetostriction on the order of 10−5 [14]–
[16], the Metglas-based ME sensor exhibits vibrations when
excited by a magnetic ac field. At the resonant frequency of
the ME sensor, the vibration also generates a significant magnetic field that can be remotely detected by capturing with a
coil antenna [17]. When a mass is applied on the sensor surface,
it causes a change in the resonant frequency and amplitude.
In addition, the resonant frequency and amplitude of the sensor are sensitive to the elasticity of the applied coating or the
viscosity of its surrounding medium. The ability to wirelessly
monitor the change in mass or elasticity/viscosity allows the ME
sensor to detect chemical and biological agents [18], [19] and
material viscosity [20], [21]. Specifically, with proper surface
functionalization, the ME sensor can be applied in cell culture or even implanted in vivo to monitor biointerfacial binding
events, such as cellular attachment and proliferation [22], [23].
The remote query capability, as well as long-term durability of
functionalized ME sensors in a biological environment, make
them suitable for monitoring adhesive degradation in real time.

Fig. 1. Chemical structure of PEG-D. The arrow points to the hydrolysable
ester linkage between PEG and glutaric acid.

Furthermore, compared to the traditional methods, the described
ME sensor technology requires a significantly lower volume of
sample.
Here, the ability of the ME sensing technology to monitor the
long-term degradation behavior of a slow degrading adhesive
was evaluated over several months in vitro. A synthetic bioadhesive that mimics the strong water-resistant adhesive properties
of mussel adhesive proteins (MAPs) was coated onto ME sensors. In nature, these proteins enable mussels to bind tightly to
various wet surfaces such as rocks, ships, piers, and other natural
or manmade structures [24], [25]. MAPs contain a large quantity
of an unusual amino acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA),
which is believed to function as a crosslinking precursor and interfacial binding adhesive moiety [26], [27]. Various synthetic
mimics of MAPs have demonstrated promise in functioning as
tissue sealant [28], [29], an adhesive for soft tissue repair [30],
[31], cell engineering [32], [33], drug delivery carriers [34], and
antifouling coatings [35]–[37].
In this study, we employed a four-armed poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) end-modified with glutaric acid and dopamine (PEG-D;
see Fig. 1) with known degradation rate [38]. PEG and the glutaric acid are linked by an ester bond, which undergoes hydrolysis with time. Dopamine consists of catechol group that mimics
the adhesive and crosslinking properties of DOPA. PEG-D was
spin-coated onto ME sensors and its degradation was monitored
wirelessly in real time by tracking the changes in the resonant
frequency and amplitude.
II. EXPERIMENTS
A. Materials
3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine hydrochloride (dopamine
HCl) and sodium periodate (NaIO4 ) were obtained from
Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). Phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) and Tris HCl were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Fair
Lawn, New Jersey). Parylene-C was obtained from Specialty
Coating Systems Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). Metglas 2826MB
(Fe40 Ni38 Mo4 B18 ) was purchased from Metglas, Inc. (Conway,
SC). PEG-D was synthesized following previously published
protocol [39].
B. Preparing Adhesive-Coated Sensor
PEG-D was coated onto ME sensor strips (12.7 mm ×
5 mm × 30 μm) following previously published protocols with
minor modifications (see Fig. 2) [13]. To prevent corrosion of
the sensor surface in physiologically relevant aqueous buffers,
ME sensor strips were first coated with Parylene-C to create
a moisture barrier. Parylene-C is commonly used to generate

an inert surface for various implantable medical devices such
as pacemakers and defibrillators [40]. Additionally, ParyleneC-coated ME sensors were previously demonstrated to remain
functional both in culture and in vivo [22], [41].
Sensor strips were coated with Parylene-C using a parylene
deposition system (PDS 2010 Labcoter 2, Special Coating Systems, Inc.) and then oxygen plasma (200 mtorr) etched (Jupiter
II Reactive Ion Etcher, March Instruments) [22]. The sensors
were then sonicated in ethanol for two minutes, rinsed with
deionized (DI) water, and dried. The clean Parylene-C-coated
sensors were submerged in a 10-mg/mL solution of dopamine
HCl in 10-mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) for 30 min to form a thin
polydopamine layer (5–50 nm) that provided a robust adhesive
interface for subsequent covalent attachment of PEG-D [42].
The sensor was then rinsed with deionized water and dried with
a nitrogen stream.
Next, 6 μL of 200 mg/mL of PEG-D in deionized water, 6 μL
of 10-mM NaIO4 , and 12 μL of ethanol were combined onto
the sensor surface and spun at 1000–1500 r/min for 3.75 min using a Chemat Technology KW-4A spin coater. The oxidation of
dopamine resulted in the solidification of PEG-D and chemically
linked the PEG-D network to the polydopamine film through
covalent crosslinking between the catechol moieties [43], [44].
The adhesive-coated sensors were dried and stored under vacuum until use. The presence of the PEG-D coating was verified
by determining the change in mass and the resonant frequency
before and after the coating process.
C. Characterization of the Adhesive Coating
The surface of the sensors was characterized using Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Spectrum One). The sensor was cut along its width to expose its
cross section and mounted onto a 90° cross section holder to
image its cross section using field emission scanning electronic
microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4700). The average coating
thickness was determined based on three measurements from at
least three images.
D. Monitoring the Degradation of the Adhesive
The resonant frequency and amplitude of the ME sensors were
determined before and after the PEG-D coating process using a
custom magnetoelastic resonant sensor detector set to perform
a frequency sweep from 150–165 kHz. The detector operated
by applying an ac excitation field through a coil (100 turn, 4 cm
long, 2 cm diameter) for 250 μs, followed by simultaneously disconnecting the excitation circuit and connecting to a detection
circuit. Due to the stored energy in the sensor from the excitation

stage, the magnetoelastic sensor continued to vibrate after the
excitation signal was removed, and the response took the form
of an exponentially decaying oscillation. The response of the
decaying signal was determined using a comparator circuit with
a known threshold and counting the number of threshold crossings, which was directly correlated to the damping of the sensor
vibration. By repeating this process for a range of frequencies,
the resonant frequency of the sensor was determined as the frequency that corresponded to the maximum number of threshold
crossings. Furthermore, by monitoring a second predetermined
threshold value, and applying the equation for an exponentially
decaying function, the initial amplitude was calculated.
After initial characterization, the PEG-D-coated ME sensors
were placed in 2 ml vials containing acidic PBS (pH 5.7), neutral PBS (pH 7.4), or basic Tris-buffer (pH 10.0), followed by
incubation at 37 ºC to achieve thermal equilibrium. Three sensors were prepared for each pH. During the first week, each
PEG-D-coated ME sensor was interrogated three times a day
using the custom ME box to track the dramatic mass changes
of the PEG-D coating as a result of the adhesive swelling. The
frequency of measurement was reduced to once a day after one
week of incubation.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
An average of 0.64 ± 0.15 mg of dried adhesive was coated
onto the sensor strips. The addition of the PEG-D reduced
the resonant frequency of the sensors from 160.99 ± 0.67 kHz
to 158.87 ± 1.08 kHz as a result of increased mass loading
from the adhesive coating. The FTIR spectrum of ParyleneC-coated sensors revealed the presence of aromatic structures
(3000, 2924 cm−1 ; see Fig. 3). PEG-D-coated surfaces exhibited the presence of PEG ether bonds (1103 cm−1 , -C-O-C-),
carbonyl group (1727 cm−1 , ester linkage), and alkyl group
(2878 cm−1 , -CH2 -) peaks [38]. SEM images further confirmed
the presence of the PEG-D coating (see Fig. 4). The thickness
of the sensor was measured to be 29.8 ± 0.25 μm, which corresponds well with the reported thickness of 29 μm given by
the manufacture. The thickness of the Parylene-C coating averaged around 8.6 ± 2.3 μm. The bottom layer of Parylene-C
appeared to be delaminated from the sensor, which is likely an

artifact resulting from cutting the sample to expose its cross
section for imaging. The average thickness of the dried PEG-D
coating was measured to be 23.9 ± 4.4 μm. The FTIR spectrum
of polydopamine-coated surface (data not shown) did not reveal
new peaks potentially due to the extremely thin coating and its
structure similarity when compared to the polyphenylic structure of Parylene-C. Similarly, the polydopamine coating was not
visible using SEM imaging (data not shown).
Fig. 5 plots the change in amplitudes of the PEG-D-coated
ME sensors when they were incubated in pH 5.7, 7.4, and 10.0.
As the coating degraded, the damping on the sensors decreased,
which increased the magnitude of vibrations and hence the signal amplitudes at resonance. The degradation process of adhesive occurred rapidly when the sample was incubated in pH

10.0, as evident from the sharp increase in the curvature of plot
that rapidly reaches saturation. In contrast, the curve for sensors
in pH 5.7 increased slowly, pointing to a slower degradation
process. To minimize the disturbance to the coated sensors, the
buffer solutions were not changed during the experiment. Given
the small amount of coated adhesive, the acidic degradation
product (e.g., glutaric acid) was not expected to affect the pH of
the buffer and the rate of degradation. The resonant frequencies
of the sensor were also measured during the experiment; however, the changes in resonant frequencies were small compared
to the frequency measurement resolution, thus only the resonant
amplitude curves were used for analysis.
Results from Fig. 5 suggest that both the Parylene-C and
polydopamine coating layers remained attached to the sensor
throughout testing. Delamination of the Parylene-C coating
would have resulted in rapid sensor corrosion and a decrease
in resonant amplitude. Similarly, delamination of the polydopamine layer would have resulted in a sharp rise in the measured amplitude data due to the detachment of a relatively large
amount of PEG-D chemically tethered to polydopamine. Both
of these occurrences were not observed. Most importantly, adhesive incubated in pH 5.7 was visibly attached to the sensor
even after 80 days of incubation.
The curves in Fig. 5 can be fitted with a function


(1)
S = C + A 1 − e−bt
where S is the amplitude of the resonance, t is time in days,
C is the starting voltage (at day 1), A is the total change in
amplitude after complete degradation of the sample, and b is the
coefficient that describes the rate of degradation. Table I lists
the coefficients of the curve fits for sensors at different pH.
The most important coefficient from the curve fits is b, which
can be used to determine the degradation rate of the sample.
By assuming that most coatings have been degraded when the
degradation curves reach 90% of their final values (S = 0.9 A),
the degradation time for each sample can be predicted by solving
(1) as
t=

− ln(1 − 0.9)
= 2.3/b.

(2)

By substituting the b values in Table I into (2), the degradation times for samples at different pH can be predicted. Table II
lists the predicted degradation times and the observed degradation times. The observed degradation times were determined by
visually inspecting the test samples. The samples were considered to be completely degraded if there was no visible coating
on them.

Degradation time was not observed during the experimentation period.

Table II shows that at pH 10.0, the PEG-D coating was expected to degrade by 34 days. Decreasing pH to 7.4 increases the
degradation time to 68 days, and at pH 5.7 the degradation time
is about three months. The predicted degradation times follow
similar trends as observed from sample degradation. However,
the observed degradation times were slightly lower than the
predicted degradation times. This can be explained by inherent limitations of visual inspection, where the PEG-D coating
appears to be gone but difficult to discern residue patches of
coating persist unobserved on the sensor. In addition, the 90%
cutoff point was set by assuming complete degradation of the
sample even when about 10% of coating was still on the sensors.
The degradation experiment carried out at pH 7.4 is in agreement with previously reported data for PEG-D, which lost over
80% of its mass over two months [38]. However, it was challenging to quantify the mass of the adhesive toward the end of
the degradation experiment using the traditional approach as the
sample progressively became more fragile to handle. As such,
it was difficult to determine the exact degradation time by following the mass of bulk hydrogel. The degradation behavior of
PEG-D over a wide range of pH levels were also monitored and
the rate of degradation increased with increasing pH as the hydrolysis rate of ester bonds occurs faster under basic conditions
[45], [46]. Physiological pH varies with tissue type [6]–[8] and
degree of blood oxygenation [9], [10] and thus it is critical to
characterize the effect of pH on the rate of adhesive degradation. ME sensing technology reported here utilized significantly
lower amount of adhesive (∼103 times lower) when compared
to traditional approaches, making it a cost effective test to fully
characterize the degradation behaviors of tissues adhesives under a wider range of physiological conditions.
Remote sensing technology reported here can potentially be
futher engineered to track adhesive degradation in vivo. ME
sensors have previously been utilitzed to characterize biointerfacial events in animal models [22], [41]. However, to implement
this technology in vivo, numerous challenges may need to be
addressed. One of which include the need to distinquish sensor responses associated with adhesive degradation from those
associated with inflammatory response, dynamic motions, and
mechanical forces present at the implantation site.
IV. CONCLUSION
A biomimetic PEG-D adhesive was coated onto ME sensor
strips and the degradation behavior of the adhesive was monitored by tracking the resonant amplitude of the sensor. When

1842

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 7, JULY 2015

the adhesive-coated sensors were incubated at pH 7.4 and 37 °C,
PEG-D degraded over a period of 2.5 months matching previous published results while using a significantly lower amount
of adhesive. The degradation rate of PEG-D also increased with
incubation pH as the rate of ester bond hydrolysis increased. ME
sensor strips remained functional over the entire time period as
the coated adhesive underwent degradation in a wide range of
pH levels, including most pH ranges that are physiologically
relevant. The ME sensor platform investigated in this study provides a useful tool to characterize the degredation behavior of
tissue adhesives in real time and paves the road toward developing a remote sensing technology for monitoring adhesive
degradation in vivo.
