Abstract—High-frequency (HF) activity represents a potential
biomarker of the epileptogenic zone in epilepsy patients, the removal of which is considered to be crucial for seizure-free surgical
outcome. We proposed a high frequency source imaging (HFSI)
approach to noninvasively image the brain sources of the scalprecorded HF EEG activity. Both computer simulation and clinical
patient data analysis were performed to investigate the feasibility
of using the HFSI approach to image the sources of HF activity from noninvasive scalp EEG recordings. The HF activity was
identified from high-density scalp recordings after high-pass filtering the EEG data and the EEG segments with HF activity were
concatenated together to form repetitive HF activity. Independent
component analysis was utilized to extract the components corresponding to the HF activity. Noninvasive EEG source imaging using realistic geometric boundary element head modeling was then
applied to image the sources of the pathological HF brain activity. Five medically intractable focal epilepsy patients were studied
and the estimated sources were found to be concordant with the
surgical resection or intracranial recordings of the patients. The
present study demonstrates, for the first time, that source imaging from the scalp HF activity could help to localize the seizure
onset zone and provide a novel noninvasive way of studying the
epileptic brain in humans. This study also indicates the potential
application of studying HF activity in the presurgical planning of
medically intractable epilepsy patients.

usually treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to control their
seizures; however, about 30% of the patients do not respond to
the medications and their seizures continue despite trying multiple AEDs [1]. Neurostimulation treatments may be performed in
some medically resistant epilepsy patients to suppress seizures.
However in the close-loop responsive cortical stimulation [2],
localizing the epileptogenic zone is important for guiding the
implantation of brain stimulation leads. Surgical intervention is
a viable option for the medically resistant focal epilepsy when
seizures are impacting their quality of life and no AEDs or medical devices are controlling the seizures [3]. Accurate localization
of the epileptogenic zone thus plays a critically important role in
guiding the resective surgery and in directing brain stimulation.
Despite considerable efforts made so far, it remains challenging to accurately identify the epileptogenic zone for favorable
surgical outcome. Intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings utilizing
subdural grids and depth electrodes are still the gold standard
of determining the seizure onset zone (SOZ) of epilepsy patients [4]. However, intracranial recording is an invasive procedure and it involves risks such as cerebral hemorrhage and infection. Current clinical practice requires a prolonged recording for
up to ten days in order to identify SOZ, which further increases
the risks and complications of this procedure. Furthermore, the
intracranial recording has limited spatial coverage since only a
limited portion of the cortical surface or brain regions can be
covered by the intracranial electrodes [5]–[7]. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has also been widely used to
image the abnormal structural lesions in epilepsy patients. However, the MRI lesion is not the ideal indicator of epileptogenic
zone. Some patients may have multiple nonepileptic lesions
while structural lesions may not be revealed with MRI in many
other patients. Additional information from other modalities is
thus much needed to further understand the epilepsy and to
better delineate the epileptogenic zone.
High frequency (HF) brain oscillations are the recorded electrical activity ranging from 30 to 500 Hz, and include gamma,
ripple, and fast ripple activity [8]. Since the discovery of the
HF activity in epilepsy patients, many studies have suggested
that HF activity may represent an effective biomarker of epileptogenicity [9]–[13]. Studies have shown that HF activity was
strongly correlated with the SOZ, with significantly higher HF
occurrence rates and durations inside the SOZ than the non-SOZ
area [14], [15]. The HF activity is also highly correlated with
the follow-up outcome of epilepsy surgery [16], [17]. Studies
have shown that the complete removal of brain areas with an HF
activity was more likely to achieve a favorable surgical outcome
in the epilepsy surgery [18], [19].

LU et al.: NONINVASIVE IMAGING OF THE HIGH FREQUENCY BRAIN ACTIVITY IN FOCAL EPILEPSY PATIENTS

Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are the noninvasive recording of electrophysiological brain activity and they have been widely used in research
labs and clinical centers to help study functioning brain activity
and pathological brain abnormalities [7], [20]–[43]. EEG has
been routinely recorded in epilepsy centers to identify interictal or seizure activity to diagnose and classify epilepsy. Recent
studies have also shown that HF activity can be recorded from
scalp EEG in both children and adult epilepsy patients [44], [45].
HF activity on scalp EEGs including gamma and ripples were
frequently associated with spikes and their occurrences were
much higher within than outside of the SOZ [45]. Since the HF
activity can be recorded in scalp EEGs, studies estimating the
underlying sources of HF activity are desirable to further investigate the feasibility of noninvasively localizing epileptogenic
zone.
In the present study, we utilized the noninvasive EEG source
imaging approach to image the sources of the HF activity
recorded by the scalp EEG. The HF activity was obtained from
non-REM sleep stage of focal epilepsy patients and independent
component analysis (ICA) was used to extract the HF components for source imaging. The estimated sources for HF activity
were then quantitatively compared with the surgically resected
region and intracranial recordings of the patients.

II. METHODS
A. HF Source Imaging
The HF source imaging (HFSI) approach consists of concatenating the scalp-recorded HF activity and imaging the HF
components using the EEG source imaging. The scalp HF activity was obtained by reviewing the interictal data of the non-REM
sleep EEG recording. The EEG data were high-pass filtered at
30 Hz and the HF activity was identified as the activity with at
least three consecutive oscillations.
The scalp EEG can be represented by modeling the brain electrical sources and the volume conduction effects. The general
problem can be written in (1)
Φ = A (R, Q) S.

(1)

The Nm × Nt matrix Φ is the electrical potential measured
on the scalp, the Nm × 3Ns matrix A (R, Q) is the transfer
matrix (or lead-field matrix), the Ns × 1 vector R is the location
of sources, the Ns × 3 matrix Q is the orientation of sources,
and the Ns × 3Nt matrix S is the activity of brain sources.
Nm is the number of EEG measurement on the scalp, Nt is the
number of recorded samples in EEG, and Ns is the dimension of
EEG source locations in source domain. The brain sources are
modeled as the dipolar current sources located in the 3-D brain
and the transfer matrix is calculated from the boundary element
method (BEM) head model [20], [46].
Since the HF activities are small oscillations and they cannot
be averaged, ICA was utilized to extract the HF activity. The
spatial-temporal EEG activity can be represented by multiple

1661

independent components using ICA as [32], [47], [48]
Φ = WMT =

NC


wi Mi Ti

(2)

i=1

where Φ is the recorded scalp EEG, NC is the number of independent components, wi is the ith weighting element, Mi and Ti
represent the spatial map and temporal activation of ith component, respectively. Each component stands for an independent
brain activity with spatial map and temporal activation. The
components corresponding to the HF activity can be selected
according to the repetitive appearance of the HF activity in the
component temporal activation. The brain source could then be
estimated by solving the inverse problem of the spatial maps of
HF components [32]. Specifically, the source reconstruction for
each HF component Ŝi will be obtained from its spatial map
Mi , and the overall brain source S could then be obtained by
combining
the HF component sources in the source domain as
N S
Ŝ
T̂i , where Ŝi is the source of ith HF component and
w
i
i
i=1
T̂i is the HF activity of ith component. The estimated source
S is thus the integrated result of all the identified HF component sources and it is the same as the individual component
source when there is only one identified HF component. Varieties of source models and source imaging methods can be
applied to solve the previous inverse problem, and here we utilized the distributed current density source model and sLORETA
weighted minimum norm estimation (SWARM) to estimate the
brain sources [49]. The patient-specific BEM head models were
built from the preoperative structural MR images of the patients.
The volume conduction head modeling included three layers
(scalp, skull, and brain) and their conductivity values were set
as 0.33, 0.0165, and 0.33 S/m, respectively [50], [51].
B. Computer Simulation of Imaging HF Activity
A series of computer simulations were performed to study the
feasibility of imaging HF activity from the scalp EEG. Dipolar
sources were simulated in the cortical structures and the simulated dipoles had random orientations. A standard head volume
conduction model, built from MRI images of a human subject,
was used to compute the forward problem and the scalp EEG
with 76 channels were generated according to the source waveforms. Gaussian white noise was added to the scalp EEG signals
to simulate noise-contaminated measurements. In order to simulate the noisy conditions in EEG, the generated HF activity on
scalp EEG is only slightly larger than the added noise in the
EEG channels. We defined the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as
the root-mean-square amplitude ratio of the signal and noise in
the channel, which has the most dominant HF activity. A thousand trials with mean SNR 1.32 and standard deviation 0.39
were simulated to investigate the feasibility of studying the HF
activity. The HF activity of dipolar sources was simulated as the
sinusoidal oscillation with the frequency at 40 Hz and the duration of the activity was set as 100 ms. Background activity with
400 ms in length was also simulated in addition to the HF activity, which leads to 500-ms data for each data segment. Twenty
data segments (10 s in total) were generated for each simulated
dipolar source and the HF activity together with the background

30 Hz and displayed at expanded time scale to mark the HF
activity [45]. The EEG segments containing HF activity were
then concatenated together for ICA. The preoperative and postoperative MRI images (voxel size: 0.9375∗ 0.9375∗ 1.0 mm3 )
of the patients were acquired from a 1.5 Tesla or 3 Tesla GE
Signa scanner (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee,
WI, USA).
The source imaging results of the HF activity were compared
with the results of interictal spikes. The spikes were identified as
these brief interictal discharges that had abrupt polarity changes
from the background EEG. The dominant interictal spikes with
similar morphology and topography were selected from each of
the studied patients. The number of studied interictal spikes was
the same as the number of studied HF activity and the interictal
spikes were averaged according to their global field power peak
for further analysis. The source analysis of the interictal spikes
was then performed by solving the inverse problem at the peak
timing of the averaged spikes. Same as in estimating the HF
activity sources, the SWARM source reconstruction algorithm
was utilized to estimate the sources of interictal spikes.

activity was used to estimate the source location and source orientation. Localization error (LE) was used to assess the source
localization performance by calculating the distance between
the location of maximal estimated source and the location of
simulated target source. The computer simulation was carried
out in 1000 trials and each trial consisted of a dipolar source
with random location and orientation.
C. Patient Data Acquisition and Analysis Protocol
The schematic diagram of patient data study is shown in
Fig. 1. Five medically intractable focal epilepsy patients were
studied and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Minnesota and the
Mayo Clinic. Four patients underwent resective surgery (not
spare procedure) and they had surgical outcome follow-up one
year after the surgery. Two patients had intracranial recordings
available and the SOZs were identified for the patients by experienced epileptologists. All the patients had preoperative long
term EEG monitoring and preoperative structural MRI scans.
The clinical information of the patients is shown in Table I.
The preoperative scalp EEG was recorded in the long term
video monitoring system with 76 electrodes placed according to
the modified international 10–10 montage. The EEG data were
filtered with a low-pass filter at 200 Hz and sampled at 500 Hz.
The non-REM sleep EEG was then high-pass filtered above

The estimated sources for HF activity in patients were evaluated by comparing with the surgical resection and intracranial
recordings in the same patients. The source location of the HF
activity was obtained by finding the strength maximum of the
estimated source distribution. The surgically resected area was
segmented from the postoperative MRI images of the patients.
The SOZ was determined from the intracranial recording. Four
patients had surgical resection and all of them were rendered
seizure free within at least one year follow-up after the surgery.
The LE, which was defined as the distance from the maximal
estimated EEG source to the border of surgically resected regions or to the SOZ of the intracranial recording, was used to
quantify the performance of HFSI in the epilepsy patients. Two
patients had intracranial recording available, and the estimated
sources were compared with the SOZ that was marked on the
intracranial recording electrodes.
III. RESULTS
A. Computer Simulation
The computer simulation results of imaging the HF activity
are shown in Fig. 2. One thousand trials were simulated and
each trial included a dipolar source with random location and
orientation located in the cortex. Fig. 2(a) shows the simulation
settings of one simulated dipolar source. The location of the
dipolar source is highlighted with the green dot and it is located
in the left frontal lobe. Fig. 2(b) shows the simulated scalp EEG
from the dipolar source based on the forward computation of
the standard head modeling. Fig. 2(c) shows the source imaging
results and the independent components of the HF activity. The
estimated source is in the left frontal lobe and it is colocalized
with the simulated source in the frontal head region. The source
imaging results from the 1000 trials are shown in Fig. 2(d).

(frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal groups) according to
the locations of simulated dipoles. The results show that the
mean LEs are around 1 cm for all the groups with the smaller
LEs in frontal and parietal groups.
B. Imaging the HF Activity
Patient 1 was a medically intractable patient with right temporal lobe epilepsy and the imaging results in the patient are shown
in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) displays the wide-band raw EEG activity (left
panel) and high-pass filtered EEG (right panel). The non-REM
sleep EEG showed interictal spikes in the right hemisphere.
Fig. 3(b) shows the independent component corresponding to
the HF activity. The time activation of the component shows
repetitive HF activity and the spatial map indicates that the activity is in the right temporal region. The source imaging result
of the HF activity is displayed together with the cortex of the patient in Fig. 3(c). This patient had the right temporal lobectomy

and the resected brain region is highlighted with the red circle
in Fig. 3(d). The maximum of the estimated source is located in
the right temporal lobe, which is concordant with the surgical
resection of the patient.
The imaging results of Patient 2 are shown in Fig. 4. This
patient had left temporal lobe epilepsy and was 33 years old during the epilepsy treatment. The non-REM sleep raw EEG show
spikes in the left hemisphere and the high-pass filtered EEG
show HF activity in left temporal head regions [see Fig. 4(a)].
Fig. 4(b) shows the independent component of the HF activity,
which has repetitive HF time course and the spatial map is focused in the left temporal region. The source imaging result of
the HF activity is shown in Fig. 4(c) and the source maximum
is in the left temporal lobe of the patient. This patient had left
temporal lobectomy as demonstrated in Fig. 4(d).
Patient 5 was a 26-year-old female epilepsy patient with left
temporal seizures. The non-REM sleep EEG shows interictal
spikes and the high-pass filtered EEG shows HF activity in the
left hemisphere [see Fig. 5(a)]. Fig. 5(b) shows the independent
component of the HF activity, which has repetitive HF time
course and the spatial map is focused in the left temporal region.
The source imaging result of the patient is in the left temporal
lobe region and it is concordant with the SOZ of intracranial
recording as shown in Fig. 5(d).

1664

localization of HF activity and spikes are also quantitatively
compared in the four patients (Patients 1, 2, 3, and 4) who had
surgical resection available and in the two patients (Patients 4
and 5) who had intracranial recording available. The averaged
LE to the surgical resection is 0.25 cm in the HF activity and
0.53 cm in the spike results [see Fig. 7(a)]. The averaged LE to
the SOZ of intracranial recording is 1.2 cm in HF activity while
it is over 2 cm in the spike results [see Fig. 7(b)]. The previous
results show that the HF activity is more effective in imaging the
epileptogenic zone than the interictal spike as compared with
the SOZ of intracranial recording and the surgical resection.

The source imaging results of all five patients are summarized
in Fig. 7. The estimated sources of the patients were evaluated
with surgical resection and intracranial recordings. In three out
of the four patients with surgical treatment, the estimated source
maxima were located inside the surgically resected regions. The
estimated source in the remaining patient was close to the resection boundary. In the two patients with intracranial recording available, the estimated sources were overlapped with the
SOZ determined from intracranial recordings. In addition to the
source analysis of the HF activity, we also analyzed the sources
of interictal spikes in the same group of studied patients.
C. HF Activity and Interictal Spikes
The source imaging results of the HF activity were compared
with the results of interictal spikes. Fig. 6 shows the source imaging results of the HF activity and interictal spike in Patient 4.
Fig. 6(a) shows the results of the HF activity as displayed with
intracranial recording electrodes and preoperative MRI images
of the patient. The imaged source of HF activity is located in
the left parietal lobe, and it is concordant with the SOZ of intracranial recording and the surgical resection as highlighted
in Fig. 6(c). The source imaging result from conventional interictal EEG spike is shown in Fig. 6(b). The spike result is in
medial area and it is slightly shifted from the SOZ as determined
from iEEG and surgical resection. This result suggests that the
HF activity source imaging could more accurately image the
location of epileptogenic sources than the spike analysis. The

In the present study, we imaged the brain sources of scalp HF
activity in five medically intractable focal epilepsy patients. The
estimated brain sources of HF activity were concordant with the
locations of surgical resection and SOZ determined from intracranial recordings. The imaging of HF activity also showed
improved performance in localizing epileptogenic zone as compared with the traditional source analysis of interictal spikes.
This study demonstrates that source imaging of the scalp HF
activity may represent a new noninvasive way of identifying the
epileptogenic zone for the presurgical planning of the epilepsy
treatment.
HF brain oscillations appear to be an effective biomarker
of delineating the pathological epileptogenic zone from the normal brain regions [12], [52]. Studies have shown that brain areas
with the HF activity greatly overlapped with the SOZ and the
HF activity is more likely to occur within the SOZ than in other
regions. Retrospective studies also showed that there is a strong
association between seizure-free outcome and removal of HF
generating regions during the surgical treatment [16]. Another
reason to suggest HF activity as an effective biomarker is that HF
activity is useful in revealing epileptogenic zone rather than indicating the nonspecific pathological MRI lesions [53], [54]. This
property ensures that the HF activity could be used to identify
the epileptogenic zone in MRI-negative patients and to exclude
the nonepileptic MRI abnormalities in patients with multiple
lesions. Since the report of successful recording of HF brain
oscillation in epilepsy patients, various studies have demonstrated the usefulness of HF activity in the presurgical planning
of epilepsy treatment. Recent studies of epilepsy patients also
reported the recording of HF brain oscillations in scalp EEGs,
which suggested the importance of noninvasive study on the HF
activity for potential clinical application [44], [45].
EEG/MEG source imaging has been previously used to analyze the functioning brain response in normal subjects and
to study the pathological brain activity in epilepsy patients
[7], [30], [34], [55]–[58]. The advancement in source imaging techniques has enabled the feasibility of studying the underlying brain sources from the noninvasive recording of electromagnetic activity. Scanning methods such as multiple signal classification and spatial filtering approaches has been
utilized to probe the brain electrical sources from noninvasive recordings [30], [40], [59]–[62]. Source imaging methods
for current density models were also developed to image the

active brain sources with certain distribution [63]–[65]. Previous
source imaging studies of epilepsy patients have been mainly
focused on the spikes during the interictal periods. Considering
the effectiveness of the HF brain activity in characterizing the
epileptogenic zone, it remains important to study the cortical
brain sources corresponding to the scalp HF activity. In this
study, the scalp HF activity was successfully imaged and the
estimated brain sources were concordant with the SOZ as referenced from surgical resection and intracranial recording of the
patients.
An important issue in the EEG source analysis of epilepsy
patients is to record the desired epileptic events and to image the events with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this
study, the scalp electrophysiological activity of epilepsy patients
was recorded using the long-term video EEG monitoring system. The long-term monitoring enabled the recording of EEG
activity during the sleep stage of the patients while the head
moving artifacts could be minimized [45]. The sampling frequency of the recording was set at 500 Hz to capture the HF
activity above 30 Hz of the scalp EEG. Studies have shown that
the source localization accuracy could be improved by utilizing
the dense-array EEG recording system [23], [30]. High-density
EEG recording with 76 electrodes were utilized in this study
to overcome the limited spatial sampling of 19 or 21 channels
as in the routine clinical settings. The patient-specific realistic
geometric BEM head modeling was used in the study to further
minimize the LE that is caused by the inaccuracy of volume
conduction modeling [20], [46], [66]. In the present study, the
scalp-recorded HF activity was processed with ICA to extract
the HF components. The number of selected ICs varies among
the patients and it ranges from one to three components in the
studied patients. When more than one IC is identified, the HF
sources for each of the identified IC are estimated and the source
results are obtained by combining the component sources in the
source domain. The HF activity was obtained during the nonREM sleep EEG of the patients in order to minimize the recording noise. Future studies incorporating advance techniques to
study the HF activity in other routine EEG recordings such
as during less frequent spikes or during ictal events may be
necessary to further investigate the HF activity in more noisy
conditions and improve the clinical application. All patients in
the current study had partial epilepsy with single epileptic focus, and studies including more patients and more complicated
patients such as patients with multiple foci would be beneficial
to expand the analysis in more general epilepsy cases. Future
studies comparing the scalp HF activity with invasive HF activity may also be necessary to further understand the epileptic
activity and enhance the application.
Despite the great efforts of many studies in imaging the
epileptogenic zone, it remains a significant challenge to accurately identify the abnormal brain regions for a successful surgical treatment. Various imaging modalities have been
used to image the epileptogenic zone in medically intractable
epilepsy patients. Single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography have been applied to
study the perfusion and metabolism of epileptic brain. Functional MRI (fMRI) was also utilized to study the BOLD

1665

response under resting state of epilepsy patients. Recent studies
have shown that multimodal neuroimaging combining the EEG
and fMRI could achieve improved performance by integrating
the high temporal resolution of EEG and high spatial resolution
of fMRI [48], [67]–[71]. Studies also revealed the strong spatial
correlation between the task-related fMRI activation and gamma
activity of iEEG in the same epilepsy patients [72]. Advanced
algorithms and techniques have been previously developed to
help on the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy [73]–[85]. Future studies investigating the feasibility of integrating HF EEG
activity and spontaneous fMRI are still necessary to further develop advanced multimodal neuroimaging techniques for the
clinical application in epilepsy patient management.
In conclusion, we proposed the HFSI method to image the
HF brain activity from scalp EEGs of epilepsy patients. A series of computer simulations have been performed to test the
feasibility of imaging the dipolar sources with the HF source
activity. The proposed method has been evaluated in five medically intractable epilepsy patients and it successfully imaged
the underlying sources of scalp HF activity as compared with
the surgical resection and intracranial recording of the patients.
The present study demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of noninvasively imaging scalp HF activity in the epilepsy
patients. It also indicates its potential application as a novel noninvasive way of localizing the epileptogenic zone and in aiding
the presurgical planning of epilepsy treatment.
