Identification of the Best Anthropometric Predictors
of Serum High- and Low-Density Lipoproteins
Using Machine Learning
Bum Ju Lee and Jong Yeol Kim

Abstract—Serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are associated with
risk factors for various diseases and are related to anthropometric
measures. However, controversy remains regarding the best anthropometric indicators of the HDL and LDL cholesterol levels.
The objectives of this study were to identify the best predictors of
HDL and LDL cholesterol using statistical analyses and two machine learning algorithms and to compare the predictive power
of combined anthropometric measures in Korean adults. A total
of 13 014 subjects participated in this study. The anthropometric measures were assessed with binary logistic regression (LR) to
evaluate statistically significant differences between the subjects
with normal and high LDL cholesterol levels and between the subjects with normal and low HDL cholesterol levels. LR and the
naive Bayes algorithm (NB), which provides more reasonable and
reliable results, were used in the analyses of the predictive power
of individual and combined measures. The best predictor of HDL
was the rib to hip ratio (p = <0.0001; odds ratio (OR) = 1.895;
area under curve (AUC) = 0.681) in women and the waist to hip
ratio (WHR) (p =< 0.0001; OR = 1.624; AUC = 0.633) in men.
In women, the strongest indicator of LDL was age (p = <0.0001;
OR = 1.662; AUC by NB = 0.653; AUC by LR = 0.636). Among
the anthropometric measures, the body mass index (BMI), WHR,
forehead to waist ratio, forehead to rib ratio, and forehead to chest
ratio were the strongest predictors of LDL; these measures had
similar predictive powers. The strongest predictor in men was
BMI (p = <0.0001; OR = 1.369; AUC by NB = 0.594; AUC by
LR = 0.595). The predictive power of almost all individual anthropometric measures was higher for HDL than for LDL, and the
predictive power for both HDL and LDL in women was higher
than for men. A combination of anthropometric measures slightly
improved the predictive power for both HDL and LDL cholesterol.
The best indicator for HDL and LDL might differ according to
the type of cholesterol and the gender. In women, but not men, age
was the variable that strongly predicted HDL and LDL cholesterol
levels. Our findings provide new information for the development
of better initial screening tools for HDL and LDL cholesterol.

I. INTRODUCTION
HOLESTEROL is an essential component in the modulation of membrane structure, cellular function, and the synthesis of new membranes [1]–[4]. Serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol are closely associated with several diseases, such as
ischemic heart disease risk [5], [6], coronary heart disease [7]–
[9], cardiovascular disease (CVD) [10], metabolic syndrome
[11], [12], and coronary artery disease [13], [14]. To date, anthropometric predictors or indicators that emphasize regional fat
deposits, relative fat distribution, and some diseases have been
studied. The predictors such as body mass index (BMI, weight in
kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters), waist to
hip ratio (WHR), waist circumference (WC), and waist to height
ratio (WHtR) are widely used in clinical studies, and many studies have suggested that these indices that are related to obesity
and health status are strongly associated with various diseases.
For example, increases in BMI and WC have been associated
with low HDL cholesterol levels, hypertension, and high triglycerides and are powerful indicators of public health risks and
cardiometabolic risks [15], [16]. However, these indices do not
always provide useful information. The WHR is not always a
good index because if the hip and WCs reduce simultaneously,
the change in the WHR value is very low [17], [18]. BMI is
widely used in the medical field; however, the ranges of underweight, normal, overweight, and obesity according to the BMI
value might differ in different ethnic groups or countries. Nevertheless, in different ethnic groups and countries, the importance
of these indices in public health is growing rapidly in studies
of adults, adolescent, children, and babies because these anthropometric indices are cheaper, safer, more convenient, more
cost-effective, and technically easier compared with imaging
techniques. Specifically, in epidemiological and clinical studies, anthropometry and sophisticated imaging techniques such
as bioelectrical impedance analysis, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography have been used for research on adiposity, obesity, and
regional fat mass. However, imaging techniques are not always
suitable for measuring fat because of the large number of subjects in epidemiological studies and because the techniques pose
a hazard to pregnant women and subjects with certain diseases
[14], [19], [20]. Therefore, many researchers use anthropometric
measures in epidemiological and clinical studies.
The prevalence of high LDL and low HDL cholesterol levels differs by ethnic group and by geographic region [21]. The

association between anthropometric characteristics and HDL
and LDL cholesterol levels has been studied in a number of
countries. Efforts to identify the best predictors of HDL and
LDL cholesterol levels in various countries and among different ethnic groups have also been made [22]–[33]. However, the
strongest anthropometric indicators for predicting the HDL and
LDL cholesterol levels remain a matter of debate. For example,
in analyses of good predictors of HDL cholesterol, the best indicator was the WHR in Swiss men and women [22], Tehranian
men [23], and Thai men and women [24], whereas BMI was the
best predictor in Taiwanese men and women [25], Japanese and
Mongolian men [26], and Caucasian German male adolescents
[27]. Several studies have argued that a combination of several
anthropometric measures does not improve the ability to predict
the HDL and LDL cholesterol levels [28], [32], whereas other
studies have suggested that it is important to simultaneously
use more than one anthropometric measure to identify various
diseases [33].
This study is motivated by the following questions: Which
measures are best for predicting the HDL and LDL cholesterol
levels in Korean people? Could a combination of anthropometric
measures improve prediction accuracy, and if so, how much improvement does the combination provide? Therefore, the aims
of this study were to identify the best predictors of the HDL and
LDL cholesterol via statistical analyses and two machine learning algorithms and to assess the predictive power of combined
anthropometric measures by variable subset selection and two
machine learning algorithms.

II. METHODS
A. Data Collection
This cross-sectional study investigated the association of the
HDL and LDL cholesterol levels with anthropometric measures.
All of the data analyzed in this study were obtained from the
Korean Health and Genome Epidemiology study database. Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants, and
the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine Institutional Review
Board approved the study.
A total of 13 014 subjects (7662 women and 5352 men)
aged 20–90 years old participated in this study. The subjects
were separated into female and male groups because body
metrics and changes in body shape with age differ according
to gender. For diagnoses of normal HDL cholesterol levels,
hypo-HDL cholesterolemia (hypo-HDL), normal LDL cholesterol levels, and hyper-LDL cholesterolemia (hyper-LDL), we
considered the recommendations of the Third Report of the
National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol
in Adults (ATP III Final Report) [34]. Therefore, hyper-LDL
cholesterolemia was defined as LDL cholesterol ࣙ160 mg/dL,
and hypo-HDL cholesterolemia was defined as HDL cholesterol
<40 mg/dL. Among the women in the study, 6053 had normal
HDL, 1609 had hypo-HDL, 6918 had normal LDL, and 744 had
hyper-LDL; among the men, 3344 had normal HDL, 2008 had
hypo-HDL, 4952 had normal LDL, and 400 had hyper-LDL.

Demographic and anthropometric data were documented for
all of the subjects. The anthropometric characteristics were measured by well-trained technicians based on standardized protocols. Body weight and height were measured with the subject in lightweight clothing and without shoes to the nearest
0.1 kg and 0.1 cm, respectively (LG-150; G Tech International
Co., Ltd., Uijeongbu). The body circumferences were measured
at eight sites (forehead, neck, axilla, chest, ribs, waist, pelvis,
and hips) using nonelastic tape; we calculated the circumference ratios between each pair of sites and the ratios between
the WC and height or weight to extract ratio variables such
as WHR and WHtR [35]–[37]. BMI was calculated as the
weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. Table I lists the basic characteristics of the subjects and
brief descriptions of the anthropometric measures used in this
study.
B. Experimental Design
All the statistical analyses and prediction experiments were
performed in SPSS 19 for Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) and Weka (the Waikato Environment for Knowledge
Analysis data mining tool). Binary logistic regression (LR) was
used to evaluate statistically significant differences between normal LDL cholesterol and hyper-LDL cholesterolemia and to
evaluate the differences between normal HDL cholesterol and
hypo-HDL cholesterolemia in the standardized individual measures. To obtain more reasonable and reliable results, LR and the
naive Bayes algorithm (NB) were used to analyze the predictive
powers of individual measures and combined measures. In the
variable selection step for combined measures, a correlationbased feature subset selection (CFS) technique [38] was applied
to all of the data to identify the optimal combination of measures and to obtain reliable results. All the experiments were
performed using a tenfold cross validation to evaluate the predictive power of the individual and combined measures. We
considered the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUC) as the primary criterion to assess discriminative
power. To report more detailed and analytical results for the
prediction using combined indices, the sensitivity, 1-specificity,
precision, and F-measure were described.
III. RESULTS
A. Comparison of Individual Anthropometric Characteristics
and HDL and LDL Cholesterol Levels
Tables II and III list the results of the statistical analyses of
the predictive power of each variable examined in this study. In
the analysis of the HDL, the best predictor of normal and hypoHDL cholesterol levels was the rib to hip ratio (p ≤ 0.0001;
OR = 1.895; AUC = 0.681) in women. The strongest indicator of the HDL cholesterol level among the anthropometric measures in men was the WHR (p ≤ 0.0001; OR = 1.624;
AUC = 0.633). In women, the rib circumference (p ≤ 0.0001;
OR = 1.767; AUC = 0.670), WHR (p ≤ 0.0001; OR = 1.869;
AUC = 0.673), and forehead to rib ratio (p ≤ 0.0001; OR =
0.523; AUC by NB = 0.674; AUC by LR = 0.675) were the

most useful indicators of normal and hypo-HDL cholesterol
levels. The WC (p ≤ 0.0001; OR = 1.568; AUC by NB =
0.627; AUC by LR = 0.628) and forehead to waist ratio
(p ≤ 0.0001; OR = 0.614; AUC by NB = 0.629; AUC by
LR = 0.630) were valuable predictors of normal and hypo-HDL
cholesterol levels in men.
In the analysis of the LDL, the best indicator of normal and
hyper-LDL cholesterol levels among all of the variables was age
(p ≤ 0.0001; OR = 1.662; AUC by NB = 0.653; AUC by LR =
0.636) in women but not in men. Among the anthropometric
measures, the BMI (p ≤ 0.0001; OR = 1.416; AUC by NB =
0.616; AUC by LR = 0.617), WHR (p ≤ 0.0001; OR = 1.460;
AUC by NB = 0.611; AUC by LR = 0.613), forehead to waist

ratio (p ≤ 0.0001; OR = 0.653; AUC by NB = 0.616; AUC by
LR = 0.615), forehead to rib ratio (p ≤ 0.0001; OR = 0.655;
AUC by NB = 0.617; AUC by LR = 0.618), and forehead to
chest ratio (p ≤ 0.0001; OR = 0.653; AUC by NB = 0.616;
AUC by LR = 0.618) were the strongest predictors. These measures had similar predictive powers in women; however, the
BMI (p ≤ 0.0001; OR = 1.369; AUC by NB = 0.594; AUC by
LR = 0.595) was the best indicator of normal and hyper-LDL
cholesterol levels in men.
In an analysis of the association between the anthropometric measures and the LDL and HDL cholesterol levels, anthropometric characteristics tended to better predict HDL than
LDL cholesterol in both women and men. The HDL cholesterol

had a higher association with almost all of the anthropometric
measures than LDL cholesterol in both men and women. All of
the anthropometric measures had a higher predictive power for
HDL cholesterol than for LDL cholesterol, with the exception
of weight, low blood pressure, forehead circumference, neck to
pelvic ratio, neck to waist ratio, rib to waist ratio, neck to rib
ratio, neck to chest ratio, and neck to axillary ratio in women
and high blood pressure, low blood pressure, and neck to chest
ratio in men.
The anthropometric measures were more highly associated
with the HDL and LDL cholesterol levels in women than the
levels in men. The predictive power of all of the anthropometric
measures for the HDL cholesterol levels in women was higher
than in men, with the exception of hip circumference, axillary
to pelvic ratio, chest to waist ratio, rib to waist ratio, and neck to

axillary ratio. In parallel with the results regarding HDL cholesterol, the predictive power of the anthropometric measures for
the LDL cholesterol in women was greater than in men except
for low blood pressure, neck circumference, hip circumference,
neck to hip ratio, chest to waist ratio, rib to waist ratio, and
forehead to neck ratio.
The age of women was more highly associated with the HDL
and LDL cholesterol levels than was the age of men. In particular, there was a significant difference in the age of women
with normal and hyper-LDL cholesterol levels (p ≤ 0.0001;
OR = 1.662; AUC by NB = 0.653; AUC by LR = 0.636); by
contrast, the age of men was not statistically significantly different between the subjects with normal and hyper-LDL cholesterol
levels (p = 0.5274; OR = 0.968; AUC by NB = 0.549; AUC
by LR = 0.519).

B. Comparison of Combined Anthropometric Characteristics
for Predicting HDL and LDL Cholesterol Levels
Fig. 1 indicates the prediction results for the HDL and LDL
cholesterol levels using combined measures in men and women
via two machine learning algorithms. Similarly to the results for
the predictive power of individual measures, the prediction of the
HDL cholesterol using combined measures was more accurate
than that of LDL cholesterol in both men and women. In the
predictive models of the HDL cholesterol levels, the AUC values
of HDL-NB (HDL cholesterol prediction by naive Bayes) and
HDL-LR (HDL cholesterol prediction by logistic regression)
in subjects with normal and hypo-HDL cholesterol levels were
0.708 and 0.713, respectively, in women; the values were 0.651
and 0.651, respectively, in men. The predictive models of the
HDL levels using combined anthropometric measures showed

slight improvements in the AUC values (0.027 by NB and 0.032
by LR in women; 0.018 by NB and LR in men) compared with
the single best indicators (i.e., rib to hip ratio in women and
WHR in men) among all of the variables. In the prediction
of the LDL cholesterol levels, little improvement in the AUCs
(0.004 by NB and 0.018 by LR in women; 0.021 by NB and 0.01
by LR in men) was observed when using the predictive models
with combinations of measures compared with the single best
predictors (i.e., age in women and BMI in men) among all of the
variables. In addition, the predictive power of using combined
measures in women was higher than that in men for predicting
both the HDL and LDL cholesterol levels.

women included 15 measures: height, age, neck circumference,

for normal HDL cholesterol and hypo-HDL cholesterolemia
were 0.708 and 0.584, respectively. Our results indicate that
for both individual and combined measures, the anthropometric measures in women have a higher predictive power than the
measures in men for both HDL and LDL cholesterol predictions.
IV. DISCUSSION
A. Comparison With Previous Studies
The HDL and LDL cholesterol levels could be influenced by
the anthropometric characteristics of specific parts of the human
body. For instance, several studies have indicated an association
between HDL cholesterol and hip circumference [39], [40]. Yatsuya et al. [39] reported that in women, a decrease in the HDL
cholesterol was associated with a decrease in the hip circumference. However, the best anthropometric predictors of HDL
and LDL cholesterol differ according to gender, country, and
ethnic group. Table VI lists the findings of previous studies on
the association of anthropometric measures with HDL and LDL
cholesterols [22]–[31], [41]. Our finding that the best predictor
of the HDL cholesterol in men was the WHR is consistent with
the results of previous studies in Swiss men [22], Tehranian men
[23], and Thai men [24]. In addition, our results that the strongest
indicators of the LDL cholesterol were BMI, WHR, forehead
to waist ratio, forehead to rib ratio, and forehead to chest ratio
in women and BMI in men are in agreement with previous results for Swiss men and women [22], Tehranian men [23], Hong
Kong Chinese women and men [31], and Caucasian German
male adolescents [27]. However, useful predictors of the HDL

and LDL cholesterol levels differed between our study and previous studies that included Korean men and women [29]. One of
the reasons for the different findings might be the difference in
the anthropometric measures used in each study. Previous association studies used only two or a few anthropometric measures,
whereas our study examined approximately 43 measures.
In a prediction study using a combination of anthropometric measures, Barzi et al. [32] reported that a combination of
BMI and other measures did not improve the predictive power
of body metrics for dyslipidemia, including the HDL and LDL
levels. Furthermore, Sharp et al. [28] reported that a combination of anthropometric measures did not enhance the predictive power because of high correlations among measures; the
best predictors among the anthropometric measures varied according to triglyceride, HDL, glucose, and insulin levels and
systolic blood pressure. In contrast, Chen et al. [33] suggested
that several measures such as WC, WHR, and BMI could be
used simultaneously to identify various diseases because the association of particular diseases with anthropometric measures
differed according to age, gender, smoking status, and comorbidities. In this study, we considered a combination of measures
to predict the HDL and LDL cholesterol levels. We used various
measures and variable selection techniques, which is in contrast
to the studies by Barzi et al. [32] and Sharp et al. [28]. Barzi
et al. [32] evaluated a combination of only two measures, BMI
and WC or WHR. We have determined that combined measures
might increase the power to predict the HDL and LDL cholesterol levels, although the improvement in the predictive power
is small.
Several studies have reported that the prediction of the HDL
cholesterol using anthropometric measures was superior to the
prediction of the LDL cholesterol. For example, studies in
Asians and non-Asians [32], Taiwanese men and women [25],
and Hong Kong Chinese men and women [31] argued that the
abilities of WC, BMI, WHR, and WHtR to predict HDL were
higher in both men and women than their abilities to predict
LDL. In contrast, a study performed in Thai men and women
[24] reported that predicting LDL based on the WC, BMI, WHR,
and WHtR was superior to predicting the HDL in both men and
women. Our results are consistent with findings in Asians and
non-Asians [32], Taiwanese men and women [25], and Hong
Kong Chinese men and women [31] because the AUC values
from the prediction of the HDL cholesterol using both individual anthropometric measures and combined measures were
higher than those from the prediction of LDL cholesterol in both
women and men.
Some anthropometry-based studies of the prediction of the
HDL and LDL cholesterol levels have reported that predictive
powers were higher in women than in men. Specifically, the
AUC values for women based on the BMI, WC, WHR, and
WHtR in the predictions of the HDL and LDL cholesterol levels
were better than those for men in studies of Hong Kong Chinese
men and women [31] and Asians and non-Asians [32], and the
AUC values for women using WC- and BMI-based predictions
of LDL cholesterol were superior to those for men in a study
of Korean men and women [29]. In contrast, in a study of Thai
men and women [24], the predictive powers of the WC, BMI,

WHR, and WHtR were superior in men compared with women.
Our findings are in agreement with the results of studies in
Hong Kong Chinese men and women [31], Asians and nonAsians [32], and Korean men and women [29] because our
results demonstrated that the predictive power of both individual
anthropometric measures and combined measures was higher
in women than in men for both HDL and LDL cholesterol
levels.
Our results demonstrated that age was the best indicator of
the LDL cholesterol level and a good predictor of the HDL
cholesterol level in women, and these results were statistically
significant. Some studies have reported an association of age
with HDL and LDL cholesterol levels [42]–[45]. Harman et al.
[42] documented that age was significantly positively associated
with HDL cholesterol and was a significant predictor of the
HDL cholesterol level. They argued that the rate of increase in
the HDL cholesterol with age was higher in women than in men.
Milman and Kirchhoff [43] reported that the HDL cholesterol
significantly increases with age in women but not in men, and
Dzugan and Smith [44] suggested that cholesterol is one of the
strongest indicators of aging. Hwang et al. argued that the HDL
cholesterol in women tends to increase with age and that the
increase in the HDL cholesterol with age was greater in women
than in men [45]. Our findings regarding the association of age
with HDL cholesterol are consistent with the results of previous
studies [42]–[45]. Furthermore, we determined that the LDL
cholesterol was not associated with age in Korean men.

41 anthropometric indices with hypertension and suggested that
rib circumference was the best predictor of hypertension in both
men and women; furthermore, rib to hip ratio, forehead to waist
ratio, forehead to chest ratio, and WHR were strongly associated with hypertension. Pham et al. [48] reported that thoracic
to hip ratio and WHR were more strongly associated with type 2
diabetes compared with BMI and other anthropometric indices
and argued that thoracic to hip ratio was a new indicator of type
2 diabetes in Korean women, independent of BMI and WHR.
These studies suggested that although WC, BMI, and WHR
indices were important indicators of certain diseases, the best
predictors may differ according to gender, diseases, and ethnic groups. The accessibility factor comprises the procurement,
availability, and economic considerations of the new indices.
All anthropometric indices used in this study are cost-effective,
easy to measure, easy to use, and cheap predictors, which is
similar to WC and WHR. Acceptability has been related to the
ethical implications of the intervention. However, there was no
intervention in this study. Finally, the practicability factor is focused on practitioners’ specific skills and capabilities. The use
of these indices will not require more specific skills or capabilities if practitioners are aware of the measurement positions
because the measurement and calculation of the ratio indices
are similar or the same as previous indices, such as WHR and
WHtR.

C. Limitations and Future Research
B. Clinical Utility of Anthropometric Indices
In this paper, we considered several anthropometric indices,
in addition to WC, BMI, WHR, and WHtR, that are widely used
in public health and epidemiology. Clinical utility is a crucial
issue in the introduction of a novel technique, method, or index
in health care. We discuss the clinical utility of the anthropometric indices as predictors of HDL and LDL cholesterol levels in
this study. Clinical utility can be conceptualized as four factors:
appropriateness, acceptability, accessibility, and practicability
[46]. The appropriateness factor is focused on the effectiveness
and relevance of the suggested indices. Anthropometric indices,
such as rib to hip ratio, WHR, forehead to waist ratio, forehead
to rib ratio, BMI, and forehead to chest ratio, exhibited a superior ability to predict HDL and LDL cholesterol levels and a
higher OR than general indices, such as WC, BMI, and WHtR.
BMI, WC, and WHR may have good clinical utility because they
have been linked with a broad scope of health states, such as cardiovascular risk factors. However, the utility of diagnostic tests
may differ according to ethnic groups, countries, and gender
[47]. There is no clear consensus regarding which anthropometric index is best for indicating HDL and LDL cholesterol levels.
The anthropometric indices suggested in this study represented a
combination of existing anthropometric indices rather than new
indices; the ratio indices that used a combination of existing indices were calculated and examined in several previous studies,
which examined the association of these indices with specific
diseases, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes [35]–[37],
[48]. For example, Lee et al. [36] examined the association of

This study has several limitations. We could not establish
a cause-and-effect relationship due to the nature of the crosssectional study design. Our results were limited by country and
by ethnic group because of the participation of only Korean men
and women. Similarly to many studies in medicine and biology,
the sensitivity of our methods was low in several prediction experiments because of the lack of subjects with hypo-HDL and
hyper-LDL. The sensitivities for normal HDL and LDL cholesterol levels had good predictive powers; however, the sensitivities for hypo-HDL and hyper-LDL cholesterol levels were very
poor (see Table IV). There is an intrinsic problem in classification and prediction because there are generally fewer patients
with medical disorders than there are healthy individuals [49],
[50], and traditional machine learning algorithms for prediction
were formulated for approximately equal numbers of positive
and negative samples [51], [52].
Recently, interest in the role of non-HDL cholesterol in CVD
risk is rising in several countries, and many studies have reported
that non-HDL cholesterol is a good predictor of the CVD risk
in patients with diabetes and a good predictor of future CVD
events [53]–[56]. Therefore, more investigations of the association between non-HDL cholesterol and anthropometric indices
are needed. Furthermore, additional studies are required to examine the optimal range of cut-off values through an analysis of
the sensitivity and specificity of anthropometric indices as independent predictors of HDL and LDL and other disease risks
and to fully establish and explain the clinical utility of the anthropometric indices used in this study.

V. CONCLUSION
In this study, we evaluated the association of the HDL and
LDL cholesterol levels with various anthropometric measures
in Korean men and women and assessed the predictive power
of each individual measure as well as the predictive power of a
combination of measures using statistical models and data mining techniques. Our findings are as follows. Among all of the
variables, age is the strongest indicator of the LDL cholesterol
level and is a good predictor of the HDL cholesterol level in
Korean women but not in Korean men. The prediction of HDL
cholesterol using anthropometric measures is superior to that of
LDL cholesterol. The predictive power of anthropometric measures in women for both HDL and LDL cholesterol is higher
than the predictive power of these measures in men. A combination of anthropometric measures could slightly improve the
prediction of both HDL and LDL cholesterol levels. Finally, the
best predictors of the HDL cholesterol were the rib to hip ratio in
women and the WHR in men, whereas the strongest indicators
of the LDL cholesterol among all of the variables were age in
women and BMI in men. Our findings provide information for
the development of better initial screening tools for HDL and
LDL cholesterol levels.
