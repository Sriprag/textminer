Atrial Electrical Activity Detection Using Linear
Combination of 12-Lead ECG Signals
Or Perlman, Amos Katz, Noam Weissman, Guy Amit, and Yaniv Zigel∗ , Member, IEEE

Abstract—ECG analysis is the method for cardiac arrhythmia
diagnosis. During the diagnostic process many features should
be taken into consideration, such as regularity and atrial activity. Since in some arrhythmias, the atrial electrical activity (AEA)
waves are hidden in other waves, and a precise classification from
surface ECG is inapplicable, a confirmation diagnosis is usually
performed during an invasive procedure. In this paper, we study a
“semiautomatic” method for AEA-waves detection using a linear
combination of 12-lead ECG signals. This method’s objective is to
be applicable to a variety of arrhythmias with emphasis given to detect concealed AEA waves. It includes two variations—using maximum energy ratio and a synthetic AEA signal. In the former variation, an energy ratio-based cost function is created and maximized
using the gradient ascent method. The latter variation adapted
the linear combiner method, when applied on a synthetic signal,
combined with surface ECG leads. A study was performed evaluating the AEA-waves detection from 63 patients (nine training,
54 validation) presenting eight arrhythmia types. Averaged sensitivity of 92.21% and averaged precision of 92.08% were achieved
compared to the definite diagnosis. In conclusion, the presented
method may lead to early and accurate detection of arrhythmias,
which will result in a better oriented treatment.
Index Terms—Atrial electrical activity (AEA) detection, cardiac
arrhythmia, electrocardiogram, linear combiner.

I. INTRODUCTION
ATHOLOGIES of the heart are often expressed as cardiac arrhythmia, presenting irregular electrical activity and leading to abnormal mechanical activity of the heart [1]. Arrhythmia symptoms and implications may include palpitations, dizziness, syncope [2], chest discomfort, stroke [3], and sometimes
death [4]. In order to successfully diagnose the arrhythmia type,

the physician must carefully inspect the 12-lead electrocardiogram, and evaluate its characteristics [5]. The atrial electrical
activity (AEA) waves (commonly referred to as P waves in
normal sinus rhythm, or P or F wave during cardiac arrhythmias) constitute one of the main key features for diagnosis, as
their relationship to the QRS complexes and the ratio between
AEA-waves number to QRS complexes number may indicate a
certain type of arrhythmia [6]. Nevertheless, the task of detecting
AEA-waves is very challenging in some arrhythmias in which
the AEA-waves are concealed in other ECG components. This
difficulty might result in arrhythmia false diagnosis, e.g., atrial
flutter can sometimes be misclassified as atrial or sinus tachycardia because the F wave is concealed in the T wave or looks like a
P wave [7]. The detection of AEA is also of crucial importance in
making the appropriate diagnosis of the arrhythmia/tachycardia
entitled wide QRS Tachycardia in which the differentiation between ventricular tachycardia (VT), antidromic supraventricular
tachycardia (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy is very important and
has significant clinical and prognostic implications. As a result
of inability to detect AEA-waves, in many cases, arrhythmia
confirmative diagnosis takes place only during an invasive procedure (electrophysiology study—EPS) [8]. Although vast research was conducted in the AEA detection field during the past
few decades, there is still a significantly insufficient ability in
detecting hidden AEA-waves [9]–[17]. An adaptive filtering approach [9] used a reference impulse train that coincides with the
QRS complexes in order to reduce them and the T waves from
the ECG signal. This method demonstrated good separation of
the AEA in normal sinus rhythm but worse results in cases where
the AEA-waves were disassociated from the QRS complexes.
Another approach uses a support vector machine [10]. After
removing the detected QRS and T waves, each lead’s slopes
are calculated; the AEA detection is performed assuming the P
waves have relatively high slope. This method showed satisfactory performance, but was not thoroughly validated on hidden
AEA-wave cases. A well-known algorithm is based on low-pass
differentiation [11]. According to this method, the AEA-wave is
found using a derivative zero crossing point in a specific search
window respective to the QRS complex. It presented impressive validation results in sinus rhythm and some pathologies.
Another method [12] used clinical knowledge, QRS detection,
and tracking of the atrial rhythm to perform AEA detection
in the case of atrioventricular dissociations. It demonstrated
good performance in some ventricular arrhythmias and sinus
rhythm but did not deal with hidden AEA-waves. A different
approach used a Gibbs sampler for P and T wave detection and
delineation, and reported impressive results [13]. A recently

published method [14] suggests using T wave filtration, followed by a wavelet transform. The main limitation of this
method is in cases where the AEA-waves fall inside the QRS
complexes.
Many algorithms were developed for the purpose of AEA
detection in atrial fibrillation. A widely used method is the
spatiotemporal QRST cancellation [15]. Another common approach is blind source separation, in which the AEA and the
ventricular electrical activity are considered as two different
sources that were linearly mixed to compose the ECG signal.
The separation of the sources is managed using principal component analysis (PCA) [16] or independent component analysis
(ICA) [17]; these methods rely on the uncorrelatedness (in PCA)
and independence (in ICA) of the AEA and the ventricular activity.
In this paper, we propose a method that relies on the same assumption as in the ICA and PCA methods that the atrial activity
can be reconstructed from a linear combination of 12-lead ECG
signals, but does not require any further limitations regarding
the correlation or dependence between the AEA and ventricular activity. As a result, compatibility with a diverse number of
arrhythmias is achieved, including hidden AEA-waves cases.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the two
variations of our method. Justification of using eight ECG leads
instead of 12 is given in the Appendix. The experiment setup
is depicted in Section III. The results of a comparative study
of our method and three other known methods ( [11]–[13]) are
discussed in Sections IV and V. Conclusions and future work
are given in Section VI. Some preliminary results of our work
were presented in [18] and [19]. This paper contains a more
thorough analysis and more complete results.
II. METHODS
We propose a “semiautomatic” method with two variations.
In both of them, we first refer to the ECG signal as composed
of two elements (sources)—ventricular and atrial, and try to
exploit mathematical methods for separation of the two sources,
followed by detection of the AEA-waves exact time locations.
The general idea is to find a linear combination from the standard
12-lead ECG signals that will represent the AEA. The algorithm
finds c weight coefficients, one weight coefficient for each ECG
lead signal (channel). In this paper, we chose c = 8 leads (I, II,
V 1, V 2, V 3, V 4, V 5, and V 6). In the Appendix, we justify that
decision. The linear combination using these weights should
produce an output signal with emphasized AEA, as in
ã[k] = wT l[k]

(1)

where ã[k] is the output emphasized AEA signal, which attempts to estimate the actual AEA signal a[k], w is the weight
coefficients vector
w = [w1 w2 · · · wc ]T

(2)

and l[k] is the c surface leads matrix
l[k] = [l1 [k] l2 [k] · · · lc [k]]T .

algorithm raw output, which contains emphasized AEA signal. (C) Band-pass
filtered emphasized AEA signal. The two headed arrows mark filtered QRS
remnants. (D) Intra-atrial electrode signal, used for performance evaluation.
The peaks in this signal correspond to the actual AEA-waves. The dotted lines
indicate that the resulting peaks in the band passed emphasized AEA signal
matches the true AEA-waves location. In addition, they illustrate that some
AEA-waves were initially hidden inside the QRS or T waves.

Both of the method variations contain a preprocessing stage in
which an eight-order band-pass Butterworth forward/backward
filter with cut-off frequencies of 0.5 and 49.5 Hz is being used,
in order to avoid common ECG noises (network noise, baseline
wander, etc.).

A. Separation Using Maximum Energy Ratio (SUMER)
In this approach, the ECG signal is initially divided into two
parts: a manually delineated segment (by a physician—expert
cardiac electrophysiologist) that contains a single AEA-wave,
and the undelineated surrounding segments [see Fig. 1(A)]. The
main concept is forcing the linear combination of c ECG signals to converge to a signal that has the maximum ratio between
the energy in the marked segment and the energy in the nonmarked segments; this resulting signal is expected to have amplified AEA-waves and reduced QRS and T waves. The SUMER
method consists of the following steps (see Fig. 2):
1) Manually segmenting one AEA-wave, which is in effect
equivalent to dividing the signals to a marked segment and
residual unmarked segments.
2) Subtracting the mean of each segment.
3) Creating a cost function of the energy ratio between the
marked segment and the residual signal segments with initial

where si represents the marked segment of lead i (with length of

i after concatenating them into one signal with M samples, and
wi is the weight coefficient of the ith lead.
4) Optimizations of the cost function to its maximum by updating the weight coefficients using the gradient ascent method
[20]. This is performed by adding iteratively the gradient of
the function to the coefficients from the last iteration until the
algorithm converges to a fixed value:
(w1 , . . . , wc )p+1 = (w1 , . . . , wc )p + μp ∇f

(5)

where ∇f is the gradient of the cost function, μp is the step
size, and p is the iteration index. The step size value we used
was μp = 1, with the following exception—if an iteration of the
algorithm resulted in a cost function (4) that is smaller than the
cost function calculated in the former iteration, the current step
was repeated using μp = 0.9μp−1 .
5) Band-pass filtering. In order to remove QRS remnants
and low-frequency distortions, the emphasized AEA signal
[Fig. 1(B)] is 2–16 Hz band-pass filtered [Fig. 1(C)], using a
Butterworth forward/backward filter of order 8.
6) Final AEA-waves detection—the peaks in the resulting filtered signal higher than a predefined threshold are determined
as AEA-waves. The threshold can be fixed for all signals (e.g.,
the top 10%) or adaptive to the specific signal measured properties. The use of an adaptive threshold approach was motivated

by the observation that different arrhythmias resulted in different levels of AEA emphasis; for example, in sinus rhythm,
the optimal threshold is approximately the top 5% value of
the peaks’ amplitudes in the filtered emphasized AEA signal,
whereas a threshold of about 10% is needed in several SVTs.
This is apparently due to the different manifestations of the
atrial and ventricular sources among the surface leads in each
unique arrhythmia, which allows a slightly different ability of
AEA emphasis using a linear combination of those leads. In order to obtain the suitable threshold for each signal, we used two
features—heart rate and ventricular regularity. The rationalization for using these features is their contribution to distinguishing different arrhythmias [7]. In practice, we initially detect
the signal QRS complexes using a well-validated method [21].
Next, we calculate the heart rate (in beats per minute units) using
the complexes found and the time intervals between subsequent
R waves (RR-intervals). We then calculate the ventricular regularity by dividing the RR-interval standard deviation by the
RR-interval mean. The adaptive threshold is calculated as

a, (HR ≤ b) and (VR < c)
Threshold =
(6)
d, otherwise
where HR is the signal’s heart rate, VR is the signal’s ventricular regularity, and a to d are scalars. The values of a and d
indicate the top percentage value of the peaks’ amplitudes in
the filtered emphasized AEA signal. The exact formulation of
(6) was based on empirical evaluation of the training database
(see Section III-A), which included exhaustively searching for
fine-tuning around known parameters for arrhythmia separation
(such as HR of more than 100 bpm to distinguish sinus rhythm
and tachycardia [22]). The parameters’ values chosen for evaluation in this work appear in Table II, and comparison of the
performance with fixed or adapted threshold is given in Section
IV.
B. AEA Detection Using Synthetic AEA Signal
In this variation, we alter the classic linear combiner, which
is a known method for removal of noise and artifacts [23], such
as: blinks and eye movements (EOG) artifacts cancellation from
EEG recordings [24] and ECG artifacts removal from EEG [25].
Adaptations and variations of this technique are widely used for
many purposes, such as detecting ventricular late potentials in
ECG [26] and estimating event-related somatosensory evoked
potential signals [27]. The main concept of the classic linear
combiner for the noise removal task is subtracting an appropriate

PERLMAN et al.: ATRIAL ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY DETECTION USING LINEAR COMBINATION OF 12-LEAD ECG SIGNALS

1037

TABLE II
ACCURACY ANALYSIS FOR AEA-WAVE DETECTION

linear combination of reference signals (that represent noise
signals) from the observed signal, in order to remove the noise.
Our proposed AEA detection method uses an adaptation of that
technique. This method’s variation consists of the following
steps:
1) Manually segmenting one dominant AEA-wave.
2) Synthetic signal creation (denoted as g[k]), where its
length is equal to the original ECG signal. It contains
a synthetic AEA-wave shape in a delineated segment, and
an isoelectric line in all other samples [see Fig. 3(B)].
The synthetic AEA-wave shape is formed as a Gaussian,
with the mean defined as the center of the delineated segment, and standard deviation defined as one-quarter of the
delineated segment’s length.
3) Utilizing the linear combiner filter for atrial wave separation (see Fig. 4). The desired filter output is the actual
AEA signal a[k], which contains the AEA-waves (without ventricular waves, such as QRS and T). In practice,
the output is an estimation of that signal (1). The filter
has c + 1 inputs. The primary input is g[k], which will
be referred to as a summation of a[k] and a noise signal,
denoted as n[k]

g[k] = a[k] + n[k].

(7)

The reference inputs are the c surface leads l[k] (3). Unlike the
conventional linear combiner structure [24], in which the filter’s
output is the difference between the primary input and a linear
combination of the reference inputs, in our case we defined
the filter’s output as the linear combination of the reference
inputs itself (1). We aim to satisfy the constraint in which the
linear combination of the reference inputs should be as close as
possible to the primary input (synthetic AEA signal)g[k], in the

minimum mean square error (MSE) sense
M SE = εw = E[e[k]2 ] = E[(g[k] − wT l[k])2 ].

(8)

Since g[k] comprises a synthetic “AEA-wave” and is zero at
any other point, including zero at all the QRS and T wave time
locations, satisfying the minimum MSE criterion is equivalent to
forcing ã[k] to significantly reduce the ventricular waves (QRS
and T), and hence emphasize the AEA-waves. By differentiating
εw with respect to w, we get
∇w εw = ∇w (E[g 2 [k]] + wT R[k]w − 2wT r[k]) =
= 2R[k]w − 2r[k]

(9)

where R is the correlation matrix of the reference inputs


R[k] = E l[k]l[k]T
(10)
and r is the cross-correlation vector of the inputs
r[k] = E [g[k]l[k]] .

(11)

By equalizing the expression in (9) to zero, the optimal weight
vector w∗ that minimizes the MSE (8) is obtained
w∗ = R−1 r.

(12)

Assuming that the input signals are correlation ergodic, the estimation of the correlation functions is commonly accomplished
by use of the time average estimator.
The conditions required for the success of using this method’s
variation are:
1) The signal is composed of an atrial source and a ventricular source (the same condition is required in SUMER).
This condition guarantees that by forcing the linear combination of the reference inputs (surface ECG leads) to
contain a relatively high energy in the location of a single
AEA-wave (using the described methods) an emphasis of
all AEA-waves (the entire atrial source) can be achieved.

1038

4) Final AEA-waves detection—the peaks in the resulting
filtered signal higher than a threshold are determined to
be AEA-waves (as in step 6, in Section II-A). A demonstration of the AEA detection using synthetic atrial activity
signal variation is shown in Fig. 3.
III. EXPERIMENT SETUP
The described AEA-waves detection method (both SUMER
variation and the synthetic atrial activity signal variation) performances were evaluated on a study cohort, aimed to contain
various types of arrhythmias, with emphasis given to cases in
which the AEA-waves are hidden in other waves, since they
present a significant challenge. Totally different databases were
used for the method’s training and validation in order to prevent
overfitting.

the actual AEA-waves. The dotted lines indicate that the resulting peaks in the
band passed emphasized AEA signal match the true AEA-waves location. The
two headed arrow indicates that the hidden AEA-wave (inside the T wave) was
revealed.

There are a few free parameters in each of the described AEAdetector variations. The SUMER variation requires choosing an
appropriate step size. The synthetic atrial activity signal variation requires determination of the Gaussian standard deviation.
In addition, both methods require selecting the cutoff frequencies of the band-pass filter at the QRS remnants removal phase
(step 5, in Section II-A) and an additional four parameters, if
an adapted threshold is being used (step 6, in Section II-A).
In order to estimate the proper parameters, experiments were
conducted on a training database containing ECG recordings
from eight patients undergoing EPS at Barzilai Medical Center,
Israel, and on one patient’s 12-lead ECG recordings from St. Petersburg Institute of Cardiological Technics’ 12-lead arrhythmia
database [28].
For detailed training database properties, see Table I.

is the primary input, which contains a synthetic signal. lx [k] are the reference
inputs, assembled of surface ECG leads, where 1≤ x ≤ c. ã[k] is the filter’s
output, which contains an estimation of the actual AEA signal.

2) The correlation matrix R of the reference inputs is reversible. This is achieved by an appropriate selection of
the reference leads, as explained in the Appendix.
3) Band-pass filtering. As in step 5, in Section II-A, unnecessary remaining ECG elements are filtered out.

We analyzed 802 10-long ECG signals, containing 23,013
AEA-waves from 54 patients with supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmia that had indications for EPS and ablation based
on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines [29], [30]. The presenting arrhythmias were:
atrial flutter, atrioventricular reentry tachycardia (AVRT), atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT), atrial tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, premature ventricular contraction
(PVC), premature atrial contraction (PAC), and sinus rhythm
(see Table II). The signals were obtained during EPS, performed in two medical centers (Soroka and Barzilai, Israel,
with ethics approval for the study from each respective medical center’s ethics committee). During these procedures, 12lead surface ECG recordings were performed as well as intraatrial ECG recordings, using GE Cardiolab IT, which produces
electrograms sampled at 977 Hz with 12-bit analog-to-digital
conversion.
C. Manual Segmentation Protocol
The manually segmented AEA-wave was identified by default
in lead II, as the first prominent detectable AEA-wave in the

PERLMAN et al.: ATRIAL ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY DETECTION USING LINEAR COMBINATION OF 12-LEAD ECG SIGNALS

1039

signal that is not entirely concealed by other waves (such as T
wave). In case difficulty in detection arose, the segmentation was
performed in lead V 1. The segmentation borders were chosen
as the onset and ends of the AEA-wave. In case there were no
obvious visible borders, the segmented AEA-wave length was
determined as 80 ms (an empirically found adequate value using
the training database).

D. True AEA-Wave Reference
During EPS, a catheter is placed in the high posterolateral wall
of the right atrium [31]. It produces a signal with peaks corresponding to the actual AEA-wave locations [see Fig. 1(d)], and
serves as a highly trustworthy gold standard reference source.
By using the intra-atrial electrode recording as a means for validating our results, we prevent the risk of human error bias.

E. Performance Evaluation Procedure
The evaluation is performed as in [12], but with a tolerance
limit of 60 ms instead of 85. We used two benchmark parameters:
the sensitivity Se and the positive predictive value P + . True
positive is calculated as the number of AEA-waves that we
have detected in at most 60 ms from the true AEA-waves. False
positive is calculated as the number of false AEA-waves detected
by our algorithm (detected waves that have no true AEA-wave
in 60 ms). False negative is the number of true AEA-waves that
the algorithm missed (in 60 ms).

IV. RESULTS
A. Global Results
We evaluated the performance of the SUMER variation and
the synthetic AEA variation using different thresholds for the
final AEA-waves determination step. As sometimes performed
in ECG wave detection [32], we will use a modified receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to demonstrate the relation
between the resulting sensitivity and positive predictive value
in each of the cases (see Fig. 5). As can be seen in this figure,
the synthetic AEA signal variation curve is closer to the optimal
point (Se = 1 and 1 − P + = 0) than the SUMER curve; therefore, this method variation outperforms the other. When evaluating the entire test database using a fixed threshold of 10.5 top
amplitudes percentage, the SUMER variation achieved Se =
88.59% and P + = 81.97%, whereas the synthetic AEA signal
achieved Se = 92.09% and P + = 90.41%. Applying different
thresholds yielded different results, with a tradeoff between the
sensitivity and positive predictive value. An evaluation with an
adaptive threshold (see 6) was also performed. Two sets of parameters were found to be adequate: (a = 7; b = 110; c = 0.1;
d = 13.2)—which resulted in Se = 88.13%, P + = 81.97% in
SUMER and Se = 92.21%, P + = 92.08% in the synthetic AEA
signal method, and (a = 6; b = 110; c = 0.3; d = 13.2)—which
resulted in Se = 81.76% and P + = 83.96% in SUMER and Se
= 86.44%, P + = 94.99% in the synthetic AEA signal method.

10.5% value of the peaks’ amplitudes in the filtered emphasized AEA signal.

B. Arrhythmia-Dependent Results
The detailed arrhythmia-dependent results can be seen in Table II. When using a fixed threshold of 10.5 top amplitudes
percentage, the synthetic AEA variation achieved high performances in atrial tachycardia (Se = 90.34%; P + = 97.81%),
atrial flutter (Se = 90.42%; P + = 96.85%), AVRT (Se =
95.35%; P + = 97.55%), and AVNRT (Se = 96.43%; P + =
96.47%); satisfactory results in sinus tachycardia (Se = 99.36%;
P + = 79.92%), and PVC (Se = 86.61%; P + = 77.56%); high
sensitivity but poor positive predictive value in sinus rhythm
(Se = 98.77%; P + = 54.35%), and PAC (Se = 97.62%; P +
= 50.37%). A possible explanation of the relative performance
degradation in sinus rhythm and PAC is that in these cases (as
described in Section II-A—step 6) the optimal threshold is approximately the top 5% value of the peaks’ amplitudes in the
filtered emphasized AEA signal. When the threshold is lowered
(e.g., the top 10.5%), the sensitivity remains excellent, but the
positive predictive value is worse due to detecting nonatrial components as AEA-waves. The same general trend was apparent
when SUMER was performed using the same fixed threshold,
with slightly lower performances in most arrhythmia cases. The
use of an adapted threshold (e.g., the one with parameters: a = 6;
b = 110; c = 0.3; d = 13.2) resulted in significantly improving
the performances in sinus rhythm (Se = 97.76%, P + = 72.11%
in SUMER; Se = 98.18%, P + = 83.79% in the synthetic AEA
signal variation); and PAC (Se = 91.07%, P + = 75.00% in
SUMER; Se = 93.33%, P + = 82.01% in the synthetic AEA
signal variation) with only minor decreases in performance of
most of the other arrhythmia cases.
C. Comparison With Existing Methods
We compared our AEA detector with the highly cited ECG
waves detection algorithm described in [11], and with two more
recently developed techniques [12], [13]. In order to obtain reliable representative results, before performing the comparative
algorithm, we down-sampled our signals to the range of sampling frequencies used in each of the comparative algorithms’

evaluation databases. The results can be seen in Table III.
In agreement with the reported comparative studies of AEAdetection performed in [12] and [13], all three comparative algorithms achieved high results when facing the sinus rhythm
cases of our test database (Se = 95.63%, P + = 100.00% in [11];
Se = 95.44%, P + = 97.08% in [12]; and Se = 96.65%, P +
= 98.04% in [13]). However, in most of the arrhythmia cases
the comparative algorithms resulted in poor performances (e.g.,
atrial flutter: Se = 24.54%, P + = 71.18% in [11]; Se = 8.89%,
P + = 51.26% in [12]; and Se = 14.86%, P + = 44.72% in [13]),
which were also manifested in poor global results (Se = 32.71%,
P + = 54.66% in [11]; Se = 14.22%, P + = 72.77% in [12];
and Se = 23.61%, P + = 59.993% in [13]).
D. Implementation Environment and Time Complexity
The proposed AEA-detection method and the comparative
algorithms were implemented using Mathworks MATLAB software, on Intel Core i7–2600 3.4-GHz PC. The time required for
processing each 10-s-long signal was approximately 40 ms using
the synthetic AEA signal variation and 9 s using the SUMER
variation (not including the time needed for the user’s single
AEA-wave manual segmentation). The processing times using
the comparative algorithms were approximately 50 ms, 10 ms,
and 2 s using the methods described in [11]–[13], respectively.

as it appears on a surface ECG lead, whereas in the synthetic
AEA signal variation, a Gaussian surrounded by an isoelectric
line is used. The benefit of using this synthetic wave lies in
the fixed positive morphology of the Gaussian, with relatively
high amplitude and energy relative to its surrounding segments.
When attempting to replace the Gaussian synthetic signal with
a marked segment (of an original AEA-wave as appeared in
one of the surface ECG leads) surrounded by an isoelectric line,
a distinct degradation in performances was demonstrated (approximately 14% lower total sensitivity and 25% lower total
positive predictive value) due to the different morphologies of
the original AEA-waves and their relatively low amplitudes in
some of the cases.
According to the application requirements, the desired tradeoff between sensitivity and positive predictive value can be set
by choosing the appropriate threshold. Some rhythms required
different thresholds than others in order to achieve optimal performance. The use of an adapted threshold that takes into consideration the specific characteristics (heart rate and ventricular
regularity) of each signal resulted in a significant improvement
in the arrhythmia-dependent performance.
The proposed AEA detector presented significantly higher
global results than the comparative existing methods [11]–[13].
Regarding the arrhythmia-dependent results, the proposed
method outperformed the comparative methods in all rhythms
(in most variations but especially using the synthetic AEA signal variation with adapted threshold with parameters: a = 6;
b = 110; c = 0.3; d = 13.2) other than sinus rhythm (all three
comparative methods obtained P + values higher than the one
obtained using the proposed method), PAC, and sinus tachycardia (the method presented in [13] obtained higher P + values
than the proposed method). In our opinion, the poor performances demonstrated using the comparative algorithms in most
SVT cases are due to their assumption of a single AEA-wave between each two subsequent QRS complexes ( [11], [13]), avoiding AEA detection in case of very high ventricular rate [12],
and assuming a fixed sequential nature of P-wave followed by
QRS-wave and T wave [13]. The AEA-wave detection in sinus
rhythm was not constricted to any of the above assumptions,
which explains why the comparative algorithms outperformed
the proposed method in this case.
The SUMER variation time complexity (9-s processing for a
10-s-long signal) makes it unsuitable for real-time ECG analysis, but possible for offline diagnostic procedures. The synthetic
AEA-signal variation was characterized by a much shorter running time (even shorter than the comparative algorithms’ [11]
and [13] running times), but the processing time calculation
did not include the time necessary for the physician manual
segmentation.

V. DISCUSSION
The synthetic AEA signal variation outperformed the
SUMER variation in all rhythms. A possible explanation is
that in the synthetic AEA signal variation the optimal weights
for minimizing the MSE (8) are found, whereas in SUMER,
a step-size dependent convergence algorithm is used. In addition, SUMER uses a single segmented AEA-wave, exactly

A. Limitations
The proposed method holds some a priori limitations. In both
of its variations, the method assumes that the ECG signal is
composed of a single atrial source and a single ventricular
source. When this condition is satisfied, emphasizing a single AEA-wave (in a given segment), results in emphasizing all

PERLMAN et al.: ATRIAL ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY DETECTION USING LINEAR COMBINATION OF 12-LEAD ECG SIGNALS

other AEA-waves (in the residual signal), due to the strong dependence between all AEA-waves. However, when the AEA
originates in multiple sites (and can therefore be represented
as the combination of several different sources instead of one)
or when the arrhythmia type is suddenly altered (therefore two
various sources can represent the AEA—before and after the
rhythm changing point) the method will yield degraded results.
An analogy for the multiple AEA source limitation can be found
in the classic linear combiner, in which an additional signal
source is picked up by the instrument’s electrodes and alters the
combiner’s output signal [23].
A distinct example of a case unsuitable for the proposed
method is atrial fibrillation. During this arrhythmia, the AEA
is manifested as irregular fibrillatory waves in the ECG. The
underlying mechanism can be either atrial reentrant circuits or
very fast firing focus [33]. Since in this case multiple sources
may generate the AEA, the atrial activity cannot be found based
on a single delineated AEA-wave. In order to overcome this
hurdle, several AEA-waves should be sent separately to the proposed algorithm, and their resulting emphasized signal should
be superpositioned to assemble the entire AEA. Since atrial
fibrillation has been a great subject of interest and research, it
is preferable to avoid dealing with this case in our algorithm
by adding a preprocessing stage that will classify this arrhythmia specifically, using one of its many existing detection algorithms (such as [34], [35]) followed by an AEA extraction and
analysis method designed especially for atrial fibrillation (such
as [15], [17]).
The validation database was composed of 10-s-long signals.
When evaluating longer signals (5 min long or longer), the
resulting performances were only slightly impaired, as long as
the arrhythmia type remained the same. However, when the long
signals contained more than one arrhythmia, a more significant
degradation of performances was displayed. The reason is that
the weight coefficients found by the method’s two variations
are nonadaptive and attempt to find a local optimal solution,
i.e., the weights that will cause the linear combination of the
surface ECG leads to be as close as possible to the actual atrial
signal in a given time boundary. When a distinct arrhythmia
change occurs—the atrial signal, the AEA-wave morphology,
and its manifestation at each of the surface ECG leads might
be significantly altered, so that the weight coefficients needed
for obtaining the emphasized AEA-signal are different from the
one needed in a different arrhythmia. Segmenting one AEAwave once in short periods of time (e.g., every 10 s), allows
subsequent and separate analysis of relatively rhythm stabilized
signals and results in satisfying AEA detection performances.
As described in Section II-B, the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian (used in the synthetic AEA signal variation
of the method) are defined according to the delineated segment’s location and length. Although the AEA-waves are not
entirely symmetrical and may present nonzero skewness (unlike
the Gaussian function used), by following the manual segmentation protocol (Section III-C) the appreciated results that appear
in Table II were achieved, i.e., an agreement between the actual
AEA symmetry and the Gaussian symmetry was not found to
be crucial for the method’s success. In addition, by attempting

1041

to deliberately delineate inaccurate AEA borders, it was found
that broadening the desired borders by more than 100% (with
respect to the manual segmentation protocol) or not including
the AEA-wave peak in the delineated segment results in significant performance degradation, whereas narrowing the borders
does not cause a significantly impaired result.
The output signal of each of the proposed method variations
contains an emphasized AEA signal that is suitable for the detection of the AEA-waves’ exact time locations. The SUMER
variation results in a signal with amplified energy in the AEAwaves’ locations, and the synthetic AEA signal variation constrains the resulting signal to have Gaussian-like peaks in the
respective AEA-waves’ locations. As a result, in both cases,
the resulting signal is a distorted version of the actual atrial
signal, with different amplitudes and not necessarily the same
morphology. Existing atrial signal extraction algorithms, in case
of atrial fibrillation, provide a signal similar to the actual atrial
signal with respect to AEA-waves’ appearance, amplitude, and
frequency characteristics [36], while the output signal resulting from using SUMER or the synthetic AEA signal variation
does not provide a direct means for further analysis of the atrial
activity besides AEA-wave position and atrial activation rate.
Nevertheless, placing the exact time locations resulting from
the methods described in this paper on a surface ECG lead with
a dominant atrial signal (such as lead II or V 1), may lead to a
means of assessing the AEA-wave morphology and duration. In
addition, in some arrhythmias the direct information supplied
by the described methods (AEA-waves’ locations), combined
with the AEA-QRS complexes relationship (QRS complexes
can be easily found using well-validated methods such as [21])
is sufficient for self-contained diagnosis [22].
Many of the commonly used ECG databases include a small
group of SVT cases, a high ratio between normal sinus rhythm
signals to SVT signals, or address a general group of SVT
cases, omitting the annotation regarding the specific SVT type.
In this study, we intentionally assembled a database composed of
varied SVTs in order to challenge our AEA detector with hidden
AEA-wave cases. Knowledge of the AEA-wave locations in
these arrhythmias is clinically important and may provide the
physician the ability to classify the exact SVT, which will result
in providing the optimal treatment.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The performances of the proposed AEA detector’s two variations are highly satisfying, presenting high AEA-wave detection ability in challenging hidden AEA-waves cases in which
existing methods demonstrate insufficient ability. Evaluation of
the results indicated that the synthetic AEA signal variation
provides the best performance, with minimal complexity and
running time. This method may serve as a noninvasive tool for
physicians to detect AEA, as a crucial step toward arrhythmia
diagnosis. It may facilitate patient diagnosis and treatment at
earlier stages, thereby greatly diminishing the risk of future major health implications. This relatively fast and uncomplicated
technology may be applied with medical centers’ diagnostic
ECG instruments. The most evident drawback of the proposed

1042

algorithm is the need for manual segmentation. Since in many
arrhythmias, at least one prominent, unhidden, easy to detect
AEA-wave exists, the method can be automated by detecting this
wave using another existing automatic AEA detection method
(such as [11]). However, the prospect of an optimal search window for this detection, and the prevention of false initial detection are more complicated. In the future, we aim to research
which ECG features serve as optimal indicators for the required
window properties, and to integrate the resulting fully automatized AEA detection method in a robust arrhythmia classifier.
Preliminary results of this approach (when applied on a small
number of arrhythmias) demonstrated promising potential [37].
Another possible future use of the described AEA detector is
its adaptation for T wave detection. This could be attempted
by sending a single T wave as primary input to the synthetic
AEA signal method. Incorporation of such a useful algorithm in
the automatic ECG analysis of the commercially available 12lead ECG machine has the potential to revolutionize automatic
arrhythmia detection and diagnosis.
APPENDIX
JUSTIFICATION FOR USING EIGHT ECG LEADS
In surface ECG, the limb leads (I, II, III) and the augmented
limb leads (aVF, aVR, aVL) are linearly dependent; all six can
be built as a linear combination of two of them. Looking for a
linear combination of all the 12 leads instead of only eight leads
is unnecessary and has some shortcomings
1) Working on a 12-dimensional space instead of 8 is more
computationally demanding.
2) A crucial step in the synthetic AEA signal method’s variation requires the reversibility of the correlation matrix
R of the reference inputs. Those inputs are actually the
surface ECG leads. In case we take all 12 leads, the matrix
might be singular or close to singular.
3) Using linearly dependent leads in the SUMER variation
might create multiple extremum points for the cost function and damage performance.
Using fewer than eight leads will cause loss of information,
which may be crucial for the assimilation of the surface leads’
linear combination to the actual AEA. In addition, in modern
digital ECGs, only leads I and II are being recorded [38]; the
other four are then calculated in real time using the inherent
linear dependency. This fact reinforces our decision to use eight
ECG leads.
