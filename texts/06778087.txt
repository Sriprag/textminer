Magnetic Resonance Imaging at Ultrahigh Fields
Kamil Uğurbil

Abstract—Since the introduction of 4 T human systems in three
academic laboratories circa 1990, rapid progress in imaging and
spectroscopy studies in humans at 4 T and animal model systems at
9.4 T have led to the introduction of 7 T and higher magnetic fields
for human investigation at about the turn of the century. Work
conducted on these platforms has demonstrated the existence of
significant advantages in SNR and biological information content
at these ultrahigh fields, as well as the presence of numerous challenges. Primary difference from lower fields is the deviation from
the near field regime; at the frequencies corresponding to hydrogen
resonance conditions at ultrahigh fields, the RF is characterized by
attenuated traveling waves in the human body, which leads to image nonuniformities for a given sample-coil configuration because
of interferences. These nonuniformities were considered detrimental to the progress of imaging at high field strengths. However, they
are advantageous for parallel imaging for signal reception and parallel transmission, two critical technologies that account, to a large
extend, for the success of ultrahigh fields. With these technologies,
and improvements in instrumentation and imaging methods, ultrahigh fields have provided unprecedented gains in imaging of brain
function and anatomy, and started to make inroads into investigation of the human torso and extremities. As extensive as they
are, these gains still constitute a prelude to what is to come given
the increasingly larger effort committed to ultrahigh field research
and development of ever better instrumentation and techniques.

I. INTRODUCTION
HE explosion of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
spectroscopy (MRS) research at ultrahigh magnetic fields
(7 T and above) is such that it is already a difficult task to
comprehensively cover it in a brief review or not to accidentally
overlook some of it; I apologize for such omissions in advance.
The focus in this review is largely on biological applications
that have provided the initial impetus for the development of
ultrahigh field MR and solutions to its technological challenges;
as such, this paper contains a significant focus on work done in
the center I lead [the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research
(CMRR)] and on applications, such as functional brain imaging
in particular and neuroimaging in general, which has been a
central research theme of our group. Interested readers are also

II. HISTORICAL OVERVIEW
The desire to extract biological information from intact biological systems nondestructively using MRI and MRS and the
development of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
introduced new disruptive technologies that allowed the study of
the human brain activity with unprecedented detail and resolution. These developments also catalyzed the pursuit of numerous
new techniques and instrumentation, including the development
of ultrahigh magnetic fields for imaging the human brain and
ultimately the rest of the human body.
In 1980s, at a time when high-end clinical MRI scanners operated at 1.5 T, efforts to examine 4 T for human imaging were
undertaken by the three major manufacturers of clinical MRI
instruments. Initial results from these companies, obtained in
their research laboratories, produced inferior and undesirable 4
T brain images [see Fig. 1(a)] and highlighted more problems
than advantages at this high field [10], [11]. It was clear that going to 4 T would require significant new investment in research
and development; it was not going to be as simple as changing
the frequency of the electronics and the RF coils. Likely because
of these conclusions, the industry abandoned the high field effort
at the time and these 4 T systems ended up in three academic
laboratories one of which was the CMRR at the University of
Minnesota.
The 4 T system designated for CMRR was made available for
us before it was shipped to Minneapolis. Mike Garwood from
CMRR used this opportunity to demonstrate for the first time
the feasibility of obtaining superior T1 weighted anatomical
images of the human brain at 4 T [see Fig. 1(b)]. These images,
obtained with a sequence named MDEFT, were reported much
later in a review paper [12] and in a journal article [13] but

were first presented at a conference in Whistler in 1990. The
success of the MDEFT approach at 4 T came from the relative
B1 insensitivity of the sequence [12], thus avoiding the problems
arising from nonuniform B1 s that increasingly plague imaging
at magnetic fields higher than ∼1.5 T. Immediately after the 4
T system was installed in Minneapolis and became operational,
one of the two studies that simultaneously and independently
introduced functional brain imaging [14], [15] was carried out
on this system [14].
We became interested in functional imaging at magnetic fields
higher than 4 T because of the successes at 4 T as well as early
work on modeling of the functional imaging signals showing
a strong dependence on magnetic field magnitude (e.g., [16]–
[19]; also see [20] and references therein). After initial studies
conducted on animal models at 9.4 T, we initiated discussions
with Magnex in 1995 that resulted in the successful development
of a 7 T, 90 cm bore magnet for the first time. We established
a 7 T human system in CMRR in 1999 using this magnet and
components obtained from various manufacturers. The system
was assembled in house by us.
This first ever “lego” 7 T human MR system was less than
ideal but the work coming from this system (e.g., [21]–[33])
started the trend for rapidly increasing number of 7 T systems.
An 8 T/80-cm bore human system was installed at Ohio State
shortly before our 7 T was delivered. Beautiful gradient recalled
echo images of brain anatomy were produced from this system
(e.g., [34] and references therein). Ultimately, however, it was
the 7 T work that defined the path of ultrahigh fields.
Human fMRI, one of the main reasons we pushed to ultrahigh fields, reached new levels of spatial resolution and specificity at 7 T (discussed further on). Spectroscopy measurements
with 1 H and X- nuclei (e.g., 31 P, 17 O, and 23 Na) obtained
at 7 T have provided neurochemical and metabolic information in the human brain with increasing biomedical relevance
(e.g., [26], [35]–[42]). Unique kinetic studies of intracellular
enzymatic rates that were previously possible only in cells in
suspension or perfused organs, such as the magnetization transfer measurement of ATP turnover rates (e.g., [43], [44]), originally introduced in 1977 [45], was performed two decades later
for the first time in the human brain at 7 T [41]. More improvements are expected as a consequence of the recent focus on
higher order shimming techniques (e.g., [46], [47]).
Until recently, all the ultrahigh field studies were conducted
in the brain. But feasibility of imaging in the human torso at
7 T, a more challenging goal due to the relative dimensions of
the object versus the RF wavelength, was demonstrated in 2008
and 2009 [48]–[51], thus starting a new burgeoning activity in
several laboratories.
Because of this large body of work, 7 T is rapidly becoming
the most advanced platform for biomedical research in humans,
delivering ever more informative results as increasing number
of laboratories acquire 7 T instruments of amassed sophistication produced commercially from major manufacturers of MRI
scanners. New peaks are expected at ultrahigh field human MR
applications as existing 9.4 T scanners are increasingly employed for human studies and the 10.5 and 11.7 T systems that
are planned for installation in 2014 and 2015 come online.

on the right of the 2-D plots. The surface coil position is indicated by two small
dots on the left side of the phantom. Since the temporal B1 strength varies
greatly among these three cases, the signal intensities of temporal points are
normalized individually for each conductivity condition in order to visualize
the temporal change for all the conditions clearly [32].

In the following sections, 7 T work briefly mentioned above
and some of the other ultrahigh field accomplishments and challenges will be reviewed.
III. FIELD DEPENDENCE OF SNR
In all MR applications, SNR is critical for image quality,
measurement time, and/or spatial resolution. However, SNR
becomes rather complex when high magnetic fields (hence high
radio frequencies) are considered with conductive biological
samples. The primary reason for this is that with increasing magnetic fields, the wavelength of the RF that must be employed
for spin excitation and signal detection becomes increasingly
shorter in conductive tissues of the human body, and smaller
then dimensions of the object to be imaged. In other words,
the relative object size becomes greater than 1; this is the case
in the human head and particularly in the human torso at 7 T.
Consequently, one operates no longer in the near field regime;
instead the RF behavior is characterized as an attenuated traveling wave [32].
Fig. 2 illustrates calculations from [32] showing gray scale
2-D plots of instantaneous transverse |B1 | at progressing time
points, generated by a surface coil placed on one side of a
spherical phantom; the calculations are presented for three different conductivities of the sample. At zero conductivity, a onewavelength standing wave (i.e., a “resonance”) is established
(leftmost column, Fig. 2); under this condition, excitation is simply not possible in certain areas, such as the middle of this standing wave. At higher conductivities approximating human tissue

version for color map) in a cylindrical “phantom” when the individual transmit
B1 vectors from each channel are first experimentally determined and subsequently are added according to the constructs shown below each figure from an
eight channel transmit and receive RF coil where experiments were performed
transmitting one channel at a time and receiving with all channels [33]. The
white ellipse in A depicts approximate boundaries of a human head.

(rightmost column, Fig. 2), the RF wave is attenuated and a
more familiar surface coil profile emerges. These calculations
were experimentally verified at 7 T [32]. Because of this behavior, image signal intensity can become highly nonuniform.
To quote directly from the abstract in [32], “The characteristic image intensity distribution in the human head is the result
of spatial phase distribution and amplitude modulation by the
interference of the RF traveling waves determined by a given
sample-coil configuration.”
Because of the “attenuated traveling wave” nature of the RF,
the SNR can be expected to be nonuniform at high fields in the
human body. This was demonstrated when transmit B1 (B+
1 )
field profile and SNR was examined in the human head for 4
and 7 T carefully, using the same coil structure (a TEM “volume” head coil), taking into account measured instrumental and
coil performance differences [21]. Even though the volume coil
employed in this particular study produced a spatially uniform
B1 when empty, B1 , SNR, and power deposition were highly
nonuniform over the human head both at 4 and 7 T, with significantly higher nonuniformities at the higher field strength [21].
The SNR was ∼2 fold higher at 7 T versus 4 T in the center of
the brain whereas in the periphery the SNR gain was only ∼1.4
fold [21].
The consequence of this nonuniform B+
1 was already evident in the early 4 T images [Fig. 1(a)] and accounted for
the highly nonuniform center bright image intensity and contrast degradation. It was originally ascribed to “dielectric resonances” [10], [11]. However, as shown in [32] (see Fig. 2) such
resonances are not sustained in the ionic environment of human
tissues but could arise from the complex interaction of the traveling waves associated with each current carrying element of
the coil. This was confirmed using both modeling and experiments [33], exploiting multichannel transmit technology and
coils introduced in [52]. An eight channel transmit and receive
(Tx/Rx) coil was employed with the same elements being used
both for transmission and reception (Fig. 3). With such a coil,
it was possible to transmit with one element and receive with
all the elements in this multichannel Tx/Rx array, thus experimentally mapping B+
1 phase and amplitude of each individual

element and reconstructing B+
1 either for the circularly polarized (CP) mode of a conventional transmitter [Fig. 3(a)] or using
other constructs [Fig. 3(b)].
The B+
1 pattern from a single element of the multichannel
transmit coil shown in Fig. 3 is spatially nonuniform, not only
in amplitude, but, much more importantly and remarkably so,
in phase [33] as expected from the traveling wave nature of the
RF at this magnetic field strength.
When the transmission is in the CP mode, the vector (i.e.,
complex) addition of B+
1 produced by each element is constructive in some places (e.g., the center of the head) or leads to partial
cancellation in others, resulting in a “volume coil” transmit B1
amplitude pattern shown in Fig. 3(a) [33]. If we approximate
where the human head boundaries would be and superimpose
it on this pattern [white line in Fig. 3(a)], we would see in the
human head the well known, center bright transmit B1 profile,
as documented at 4 and 7 T in [21]. If, on the other hand, we
transmit with each element individually and form a construct
based on B+
1 magnitudes alone, analogous to what can be done
for multichannel receive operation, then the pattern is no longer
center bright [Fig. 3(b)] [33]; on the contrary, it is weak in the
center and strong in the periphery.
Of course, in practice, in the CP transmission mode, a
“vector” addition of B+
1 from each current carrying element
is accomplished in hardware during the pulse. It would be impractical to pulse each element one at a time and then generate a
magnitude combination as in Fig. 3(b). Therefore, one normally
operates under conditions of Fig. 3(a), with destructive interferences leading to relatively lower flip angles in the periphery of
the human head. These destructive interferences, which become
more pronounced at higher fields, are the source of less than
linear SNR gains in the periphery of the brain when using a volume transmit and receive coil [21]. When such interferences are
avoided, as in single voxel spectroscopy executed using small
voxels, SNR gains in the periphery also increase slightly better
than linearly in going from 4 to 7 T [39].
The B+
1 inhomogeneity problem can be ameliorated or
corrected using multichannel transmit coils and parallel transmit capability [48], [52], [53] together with various strategies such as B1 -shimming [49], [50], [52]–[55], transmit sense
(e.g., [56]–[58]), spoke pulses (e.g., [59]–[65]), k T pulses [66],
etc., to generate uniform flip angles over a targeted region such
as the brain. The detected signal intensity will still be nonuniform due to the spatially inhomogeneous sensitivity of the receive coil(s). However, “destructive interferences” per se can
be avoided or minimized on the receive side if a multichannel
receive coil is employed with signals for each channel collected
separately but simultaneously and only combined subsequently.
The SNR increases measured at 7 T relative to 4 T [21] were
for same bandwidth and full relaxation. Such conditions are
not universally applicable in image acquisition. With repetitive
RF pulsing without full relaxation, SNR will be diminished but
more so at higher fields for nuclear spins such as protons, where
spin-lattice relaxation times get longer with increasing magnetic
fields ([67] and references therein). Other nuclei such as 17 O
and 31 P [30], [68] will be unaffected or even gain due to this

UĞURBIL: MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING AT ULTRAHIGH FIELDS

phenomenon. Similarly, under many conditions, the bandwidth
needs to be higher at the higher field strength, leading the noise
increase as the square root of the bandwidth.
SNR gains with increasing magnetic fields can be larger with
low gyromagnetic nuclei such as 17 O, 23 Na, 13 C, and 31 P all of
which are of great biological interest. Among these nuclei, 17 O
and 23 Na resonate at particularly low frequencies. For example, at 9.4 T, 17 O resonates at 54 MHz while the 1 H resonance
frequency is 400 MHz. At such low frequencies, SNR can vary
7/4
with magnetic field according to Bo [69], [70] even in conductive biological samples. Consistent with theory, approximate
quadratic dependence of SNR on field strength was experimentally observed between 9.4 and 4.7 T in the rat brain [68] for
direct detection of the 17 O nucleus. This sensitivity gain was
critical in performing biologically important measurement of
oxygen consumption rate in the brain (e.g., [40], [71]). For
these low gyromagnetic nuclei, going to fields higher than 7 T,
such as 10.5 or 11.7 T that are expected to be operational soon
will bring significant SNR gains, hence spatial and/or temporal
resolution.

fMRI has rapidly emerged as the dominant and virtually indispensable method for studying the human brain, which is endowed with unique capabilities that often cannot be studied in
animal models. Since its introduction in 1992 [14], [15], [72],
fMRI has fueled explosive developments in the investigation
of brain function, achieving depiction of functional activity in
three dimensions from whole brain studies with approximately
a millimeter resolution to imaging with submillimeter resolution at the level of cortical columns [73]–[81], layers, [82]–[85]
and other fine scale organizations, such as frequency preference in the human inferior colliculus [86], and digits of the
hand [87], [88]. Functional mapping of such fine scale organizations has been possible only at high and ultra high fields.
Orientation columns, which were never previously depicted in
the human brain, were imaged at 7 T for the first time together
with ocular dominance columns (ODCs), revealing the organizational relationship between them [74] (see Fig. 4). This
was possible only with ultrahigh magnetic fields and extensive theoretical and experimental studies aimed at understanding the complex set of mechanisms underlying the ultimate
coupling between neuronal activity and MRI signals. Demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining functional maps of such
columnar organizations heralded the exciting prospect of exploring unmapped and/or unknown functional organizations
in the human brain at the level of elementary computational
units.
In addition to the indispensable improvements in spatial accuracy, SNR, and functional contrast-to-noise ratio (fCNR) to
achieve some of the most advanced applications of fMRI, ultrahigh fields have in fact provided one of the most, if not the most,
important tool to study the mechanisms operative in fMRI.

Functional imaging signals predominantly originate from the
BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) mechanism [16];
this mechanism relies on the magnetic susceptibility difference
between intravascular space containing deoxyhemoglobin and
surrounding tissue and, as such, is amplified with magnetic
field magnitude (e.g., [16], [17], [89], [90]). These early BOLD
models are largely accurate, albeit incomplete with respect to
definition of the fMRI signals. Some of the contributions that
were unaccounted for in the early modeling efforts, such as
intravascular BOLD [20], [29], [91] and inflow effects [92]–[94]
form the basis for the successful use of lower field magnets, such
as 1.5 T, for the acquisition of functional images.
Nevertheless, a more comprehensive understanding of the
origins of fMRI signals ([20] and references therein) have also
reconfirmed our initial expectations that ultrahigh fields provide
major advantages for high resolution and high accuracy functional mapping; these expectations have been largely demonstrated experimentally by a plethora of studies conducted with
high magnetic fields (e.g., see reviews [95]–[99]). However,
some of the gains tend to level off with increasing field magnitude [20].
One of the major advantages of ultrahigh fields is increased
spatial accuracy of fMRI signals. The dominant approach employed in fMRI applications is T∗2 weighted gradient recalled
echo (GRE) fMRI technique, implemented with echo planar
imaging (EPI)-based acquisition. GRE fMRI, however, suffers
from spatial inaccuracies in functional mapping because of large
vein contributions. Often one is concerned with the large blood
vessels on the pial surface of the brain. This major confound
was realized and documented as early as in 1993 [100], [101]
and was recently further reemphasized [84].

IV. FUNCTIONAL NEUROIMAGING

1368

GRE fMRI studies would also have a strong contribution
from ∼50 to ∼100 μ diameter intracortical veins that run
perpendicular to the cortical surface and drain the different layers. These are the veins that were visualized in the original
BOLD imaging work conducted in rats [102]; they can also be
seen in very high-resolution human brain images with high T∗2 or
phase contrast (e.g., [53], [103], [104]). These intracortical small
veins can be limiting to laminar specific studies [105]–[107] but
they would certainly produce functional mapping signals more
accurate than the draining pial veins.
In GRE fMRI, the BOLD effect comes from extravascular
and intravascular sources. The latter originates from the T2 and
T∗2 changes accompanying the stimulus- or task-induced alterations in deoxyhemoglobin content in blood and occurs at all
levels of the vasculature; hence, it can degrade the spatial fidelity
of fMRI maps. But this confound is diminished at ultrahigh
fields as blood T2 and, more relevantly for GRE fMRI, blood
T∗2 decreases [20], [29] and becomes much shorter than tissue
values of this parameter. Consequently, in a typical GRE fMRI
acquisition where echo time TE is set approximately equal to
tissue T∗2 , blood contribution to the image can be significantly
reduced or even absent depending on the field strength [29].
This suppresses or even eliminates one of the major contributions to inaccurate functional signals, one associated with the
intravascular blood effect.
Unlike the intravascular BOLD contribution, however, the
extravascular BOLD effect persists at all field strengths and
increases with increasing field magnitude [20]; because of this,
large draining veins continue to be a source of inaccurate functional mapping signals in GRE fMRI even at ultrahigh fields.
However, the microvascular contributions to functional mapping
signals originating from capillaries, postcapillary venules, and
intracortical small veins also get significantly larger at the ultrahigh fields due to both extra- and intravascular BOLD mechanisms [22], [108], enabling accurate mapping that would not
be possible at lower magnetic fields. This relative microvascular
gain was demonstrated in early 7 T studies [22], [109]. Recently,
the presence of this microvascular contribution at 7 T was relied
upon when it was demonstrated that, in high resolution 7 T fMRI
studies, “stripping” away the outer cortical layers where the pial
vein contribution is dominant and looking into deeper layers of
the cortex [84] yielded more accurate functional maps. Without
the significant presence of the functional mapping signals of
microvascular origin in addition to the large pial vessel effects
on the cortical surface, this strategy would not have worked.
The low-fidelity large vessel effects that persist in GRE fMRI
even at high fields can be suppressed with spin echo (SE)-based
fMRI at ultrahigh but not at low magnetic fields. SE fMRI responds to apparent T2 (as opposed to T∗2 ) changes both in the extravascular space around microvasculature (capillaries and small
postcapillary venules) and in blood itself [20], [91], [95], [110].
Functional mapping signals associated with extravascular component of the SE mechanism are expected to provide improved
spatial specificity. The intravascular T2 effect, on the other hand,
is associated with all deoxyhemoglobin containing blood vessels, large and small; hence, it can degrade spatial specificity
of functional maps due to the large vessels exhibiting intravas-

cular T2 changes. Fortuitously, the blood T2 becomes significantly smaller than brain tissue T2 at ultrahigh fields, as previously mentioned, ([20], [29] and references there in) so that
at TE values that correspond approximately to gray matter T2 ,
the blood signal would be significantly diminished, and even
undetectable.
At 3 T, ∼50% of the SE fMRI signals were shown to arise
from blood [111]. But at 7 T, the blood contribution was estimated to be less than 10% at echo times matching gray matter T2 [29]. Consequently, at very high fields such as 7 T or
higher, the functionally nonspecific blood component and the
extravascular BOLD effect associated with large veins are both
suppressed in SE studies [20], [29], [109]. Residual large vessel effects are still expected because the extravascular BOLD
effect with large blood vessels is not exactly zero in SE fMRI;
rather, it is small and significantly less than effects associated
with microvasculature [20].
When viewing SE fMRI data, however, one must remember
that SE-based fast sequences most frequently used for fMRI do
not encode pure spin echo contrast; rather, they contain T∗2 “contaminations” the extent of which depend on specific acquisition
parameters.
The advantages of high and ultrahigh field fMRI have largely
been exploited in applications where a section of the brain, such
as the primary visual cortex (e.g., [73], [74], [112], area MT [80]
or the auditory cortex (e.g., [25], [85], [86]) was studied using
field of view restriction. Ultimately, however, we need to cover
the entire brain in high resolution. Only recently, significant
progress has been made in tackling the difficulties inherent in
obtaining rapid whole brain coverage at 7 T using techniques
like GRE EPI, the predominant method employed in fMRI.
EPI (or similar fast acquisition techniques such as those based
on spiral trajectories) are challenged by the shorter T∗2 and increased magnetic field inhomogeneities at high fields. The problem is particularly severe for “single-shot” techniques that acquire the entire desired k-space in a single echo train after the
RF pulse. Higher resolution imaging, enabled by the increased
SNR of the ultrahigh fields, exacerbates the problem as the echo
train length is elongated with the increased spatial resolution.
However, such single-shot methods are critically important in
fMRI; replacing them with multishot, segmented versions prolongs acquisition times, and more importantly, increases temporal signal variations (i.e., temporal SNR) in the fMRI time
series, and hence degrades fCNR of the activity maps.
The transformative technology that alleviated the aforedescribed problem is parallel imaging to undersample the phase
encode direction [113]–[115]. In EPI, the use of parallel imaging
allows the echo train length to be shorter by skipping k-space
lines. This minimizes phase accrual due to off-resonance effects,
thus decreasing distortions and reducing signal loss due to T∗2
decay during the echo train. GRE EPI-based fMRI images with
diminished distortion artifacts were demonstrated shortly after
the introduction of parallel imaging (e.g., [116], [117]). At the
present, it is possible to obtain excellent submillimeter isotropic
resolution, slice selective GRE EPI images over the entire brain
at 7 T with a 32-channel receive coil using parallel imaging
with a reduction factor (and maximum aliasing) of 4 along the

phase encode direction; such images (e.g., see Fig. 2 in [118]
and Fig. 5 in this paper) provide an excellent basis for ultrahigh
field and ultrahigh resolution fMRI studies. In 3-D EPI with two
phase encode directions, even higher 2-D reduction factors can
be attained [119], decreasing both the echo train length as well
as the 3-D volume acquisition times significantly.
Parallel imaging is also highly synergistic with ultrahigh
fields. Complex phase patterns generated over the object by
the traveling wave behavior of the RF at higher fields, discussed
before, help suppress spatially dependent noise amplification
(i.e., g-factor noise [114]) for a given size object [120]–[123].
Of course, reducing the number of k-space lines collected decreases the SNR by the square root of the reduction factor.
However, the consequences of this reduction are less significant at higher fields where there are inherent SNR gains. In
particular for fMRI, reduction in the SNR of each individual
image in the fMRI time series does not determine fCNR unless temporal signal variance is dominated by thermal noise
(e.g., [108], [124]–[129] and references therein); this is often
not the case except for very high resolution imaging. The use
of parallel imaging can even improve the fCNR despite the loss
of SNR in each image of the fMRI time series, for example, by
avoiding segmentation [128].
Of course, high resolution whole brain coverage also leads
to increased volume acquisition times (TR) necessitating compromises such as thick slices, large interslice gaps or sacrificed
temporal resolution (e.g., [119], [130]–[135]).
Motivated by the prospect of acquiring high resolution, whole
brain fMRI data at 7 T, but confronted with the long TRs
required for whole brain coverage, “slice accelerated” multiband (MB) imaging, also referred to as simultaneous multislice
(SMS) imaging, was introduced for GRE fMRI using concurrent
accelerations along both the slice and in-plane phase-encode directions [136], [137]. In this approach, several slices are simultaneously excited using multibanded RF pulses and subsequently
acquired in a single EPI echo train; the simultaneously acquired
slices are then unaliased using parallel imaging principles.
The performance of the MB approach is significantly improved by effectively shifting the simultaneously excited and
acquired slices relative to each other in the phase encoding direction [118], [138]–[141]. An example of whole brain 7 T GRE
EPI images, of the type that would be used for fMRI studies,

1369

acquired with the multiband acceleration and 1-mm isotropic
resolution is illustrated in Fig. 5.
Multiband EPI acquisitions at 7 T, especially when highresolution imaging is desired, must employ “in-plane” parallel
imaging with phase encode undersampling in addition to acceleration along the slice direction. This is not necessarily the case
at lower fields. The data in Fig. 5, for example, employed a MB
acceleration of 4 and in-plane acceleration of 3, thus achieving a
12-fold 2-D acceleration. The original 7 T work with Multiband
reported a 16-fold 2-D acceleration [136], [137]. However, the
use of phase encode undersampling inevitably reduces the maximum achievable slice acceleration since both processes rely on
the same coil-specific spatial information.
Especially at 7 T, but even at lower fields strengths such as
3 T, the multiband technique quickly runs in to peak power and
power deposition limitations, particularly when employed with
spin echoes as in diffusion-weighted imaging. Efforts based on
using different RF pulses [142], [143] or parallel transmit pulse
design [64], [118] has been important advances to overcome
these limitations. The parallel transmit pulse design approach
provides the unique capability to improve the flip angle distribution over the targeted volume while constraining power
parameters [64], [118]; this has been demonstrated first for total
RF power [64], [118] and recently extended to global and local
power deposition [144]–[146].
Although these slice accelerated sequences have been introduced for fMRI initially at 7 T [136], [137], they have so far been
employed at 3 T predominantly within the context of the Human Connectome Project for resting state and task fMRI, and
diffusion imaging for tractography [118], [147]–[152]. However, these techniques clearly will enable high resolution whole
brain imaging rapidly at all field strengths and will find numerous applications in high resolution fMRI studies at ultrahigh
fields.
B. Resting State Networks
Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI)
uses correlations in the spontaneous temporal fluctuations in an
fMRI time series to deduce “functional connectivity”; it serves
as an indirect but nonetheless invaluable indicator of gray-matter
regions that interact strongly and, in many cases, are connected
anatomically (e.g., see [150] and references therein).
Resting state does not refer to the brain being at rest, which
is never the case; rather it simply refers to the subject being
at “rest” in the scanner, not performing a directed task or exposed to an external stimulus as in normal fMRI. An fMRI time
series collected in such a state contains fluctuations that often
display strong correlations among distant gray matter regions,
revealing networks of interconnected temporal variations, referred to as resting state networks (RSNs). These correlated
fluctuations are thought to largely reflect spontaneous neural
activity [131], [153]–[155]. However, it remains unclear why
functionally related areas undergo such spontaneous fluctuations. As would be expected, the spontaneous activity detected
in resting state fMRI signals are as much as 2 fold larger at 7 T
compared to 3 T under similar data acquisition conditions [131];

1370

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MAY 2014

this field dependence can be exploited to obtain resting state data
at higher spatial resolution and/or without having to perform intersubject averaging [156].
Detailed studies of RSNs with rfMRI have been restricted to
3 T or lower magnetic fields. At 3 T, rfMRI experiments typically use voxel volumes of approximately 27 mm3 (i.e., 3-mm
isotropic voxels) to achieve sufficient minimum SNR and fCNR.
Furthermore, typically, these studies employ spatial smoothing
with large Gaussian kernels [∼4 to 6 mm FWHM (full width at
half maximum)] to reduce noise, and often also resort to group
averaging, which further amplifies spatial blurring by requiring additional smoothing (∼6–8 mm FWHM) of the functional
data to compensate for the variability of anatomical structures
across subjects. Consequently, at 3 T, the “partial volume” effects arising from the large effective voxel volume employed as
well as the nonspecific spread of the activation [109] constrain
the spatial accuracy of the resulting rfMRI maps.
The exception to the very large voxel sizes typically employed
at 3 T are the recent data generated within the human connectome project (HCP) [149] where the voxel size for the rfMRI
data is 2 mm isotropic [118], [150]. This was feasible because of
the use of slice accelerated multiband technique with an acceleration (i.e., MB factor) factor of 8, resulting in subsecond (0.7 s)
whole brain coverage [118], [150]. Such rapid sampling of the
spontaneous fluctuations in an rfMRI time series was shown
to improve the statistical significance of the resulting RSNs
detected [150], [157]; in the HCP, this was further confirmed,
resulting in previously unobtainable number of independent and
highly fine grained RSNs [150] as well as remarkable correlation
with phenotypes [158].
The higher functional specificity, and fCNR inherent at ultrahigh fields such as 7 T can be exploited to further alleviate
the limitation on either the number of independent RSNs detected and/or the spatial resolution of the RSNs. However, ultrahigh field efforts have been focused on rfMRI only recently.
A high resolution examination of RSNs conducted at 7 T [156]
demonstrated the detection of spontaneous fluctuations within
functionally connected networks in single subjects without the
need for spatial smoothing, at nominal voxel volumes as small
as 1 mm3 (isotropic voxel dimension), significantly smaller than
the voxel sizes employed at 3 T. An example from this 7 T work
is illustrated in Fig. 6. The areas in color are regions that show
distinct correlated spontaneous fluctuations and, as such, are
consider functionally related.
So far, these 7 T rfMRI studies, however, were not performed with the previously mentioned slice-accelerated multiband sequences that improve the statistical significance of
RSNs detected. Additional gains will definitely be realized with
slice-accelerated sequences as indicated by the piloting efforts actively pursued currently within the human connectome
project [118].
V. STRUCTURAL NEUROIMAGING
Structural MRI is increasingly accepted as a surrogate for
anatomic phenotype. It is not hard to find examples where
anatomic MRI has transformed the entire research landscape of

Fig. 6. A resting state network [the so-called default mode network (DMN)]
(shown in color superimposed on anatomical images in gray scale). extracted
using independent component analysis (ICA) from 1-mm isotropic resolution,
whole-brain 7 T rfMRI time series. Three orthogonal planes from the whole
brain data are shown. Data were acquired using standard GRE EPI without
slice acceleration but with 4-fold acceleration along the in-plane phase encode
direction. The DMN data in color is superimposed on 0.6-mm isotropic T1

[156].

a biomedical field: cerebro-vascular disease, epilepsy, multiple
sclerosis, and other inflammatory conditions, cerebral developmental disorders, to some extent psychiatric disorders, and
neurodegenerative disorders. Ultrahigh field MRI is anticipated
to expand these boundaries and usher in new possibilities in
visualizing pathologies in human diseases as well. This expectation is based on the realization that beyond the well-established
SNR gains, ultrahigh fields provide significant gains in contrast
mechanisms and contrast magnitude for structural MRI. This
was not necessarily predicted at the launch of the high field
effort with 4 T systems, but has proven to be the case.
Morphological images of brain tissue rely largely on proton
density T1 and T2 differences between tissue type and regional
variations (e.g., white matter versus gray matter, cortex versus
subcortical nuclei, etc.). Proton density is clearly a magnetic
field-independent parameter. However, relaxation times T1 and
T2 are field dependent, with T1 generally increasing and the T2
and T∗2 decreasing with field strength (see review [159] and data
compiled from the literature in [20]). What was surprising was
that, contrary to expectations, the dispersion in T1 also increases
with increasing magnetic fields in the brain, leading to superior
T1 -weighted structural images at the higher magnetic fields [67].
This superior T1 contrast was in fact observed in the early 4 T
anatomical images; at 4 T, white matter was noted to be no
longer uniform in appearance as in 1.5 T and that previously
unseen white matter structures, such as the optic radiation, were
clearly visualized [12], [13].
It is not known if, as in the case of T1 , the dispersion of
the T2 values in the brain also increases with higher magnetic
fields. T2 -based contrast-to-noise ratio nevertheless benefits at
least from the SNR gains at ultrahigh fields. Combined with
high resolutions that can be attained, T2 weighted images at
7 T have yielded unprecedented anatomical detail. For example,
T2 weighted high resolution images at 7 T provided exquisite
anatomy of the hippocampus (Fig. 7), permitting segmentation
of the subcompartments of the hippocampus, visualization of
the internal structures of malrotated hippocampal bodies, and
the paucity of interdigitations in patients with temporal lobe
epilepsy (TLE) [160].
At high magnetic fields, other unique contrast mechanisms
that are not typically employed at lower field strengths (or not

employed with equal success) have emerged as well. These are
T∗2 weighted imaging, phase imaging, susceptibility imaging,
and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI).
The T∗2 weighted imaging can be obtained in a straightforward fashion simply using gradient recalled echoes; it exploits
the fact that T∗2 of a given voxel gets influenced by tissue specific processes, such as microscopic susceptibility differences,
and the fact that field inhomogeneities induced by susceptibility
differences are proportional to the magnetic field magnitude. At
the high resolutions attainable with ultrahigh fields, this simple
approach was shown to yield exquisite brain anatomy, for example, at 8 T in the very early days of ultrahigh field imaging
([34] and references therein).
SWI [161] also relies on susceptibility differences and emphasizes the contrast in the magnitude images by multiplication with a mask obtained from the phase of the same data; it
has produced remarkable anatomical detail at 7 (e.g., [162] and
9.4 T [103]). Fig. 8 displays SWI images depicting venous blood
vessels obtained at 3 and 9.4 T [103]. These blood vessels are
visible in SWI data because of the strong susceptibility difference between the vessel interior and surrounding tissue, induced
by the presence of the strongly paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin
molecule in the venous side of the circulation. Based on this
capability, it would be expected, for example, that microbleeds
(a problem of clinical concern) can be detected better at the 7 T
or higher magnetic fields (e.g., [163]–[165]) compared to the
clinically used fields of 1.5 and 3 T.
Phase imaging was introduced using 7 T [166], [167] and
exploits the fact that there exists frequency differences between
gray and white matter and many other structures of the brain.

1371

Thus, the phase of the MR signal in the brain disperses as a result
of this frequency difference and can be mapped. The origin
of this frequency difference is still discussed in the literature
(e.g., [168]–[173]) and largely appears to reflect iron and/or
myelin content; however, the fact that it can generate images
with exquisite anatomical detail is unquestioned.
The aforediscussed contrast mechanism all represent in part,
if not fully, different ways of detecting the consequences of
susceptibility heterogeneities. Rather than these indirect measurements, direct quantitative susceptibility mapping has also
emerged as a way of reproducibly imaging the intrinsic tissue
susceptibility contrast, which at ultrahigh fields such as 7 T
produce images that contain detailed anatomical information
(e.g., [174]–[176]).
One of the clear gains for morphological imaging at ultrahigh
fields is vascular imaging without the use of exogenous contrast agents. Such a capability is of paramount importance for a
variety of fields, including for fMRI mechanisms [177] where
vasculature plays a critical role in coupling physiological events
to MR detectable signals, tumor biology where angiogenesis is
necessary for tumor growth and, of course, in clinical medicine
where ischemic events due to blood vessel occlusion are cause of
pathologies. Time-of-flight (TOF) methods employed for imaging vasculature without exogenous contrast benefit from both
the enhanced SNR and the long T1 of ultrahigh fields. Blood T1
is virtually insensitive to its oxygenation state and also increases
linearly with field strength going from 1.5 to 9.4 T according
to T1 = 1.226 + 0.134B0 [178]. Prolongation of tissue T1 permits improved background suppression in TOF angiography.
The combined effects impart a clear benefit in TOF imaging
of vasculature on the arterial side [55], [179]–[181], as well
as in perfusion imaging using spin-labeling techniques. Small
diameter arterial blood vessels that are poorly visualized or undetected at 3 T can be clearly seen at 7 T TOF angiography,
without the use of any exogenous contrast agent, especially
when using techniques that overcome the power deposition and
B1 nonuniformity limitations [55], [181] of ultrahigh magnetic
fields (Fig. 9).
VI. IMAGING IN THE HUMAN TORSO
Ever since the discouraging early 4 T results from Siemens
laboratories [11], and similar unpublished results from the other
two major manufacturers, the human torso has been considered
too difficult to tackle at ultrahigh fields. Consequently, work
carried out at 4 T and higher magnetic fields have been restricted
predominantly to the head or the extremities [5] and breast [182]
where the object size relative to the RF wavelength employed is
manageable. In the torso, the exception was imaging the prostate
but with a small endorectal coil positioned immediately adjacent
to the tissue of interest [51], [182].
Fig. 10(a) shows an image of a single slice through the
body obtained at 4 T in early work [11], and indeed it highlights the presence of major problems. As previously discussed,
these problems were ascribed to a “dielectric resonance” at
the time. However, again, as already discussed, this problem is
now understood to arise from the smaller wavelength of the RF

1372

and [181].

relative to the object size, leading to a damped traveling wave
behavior [32], and consequently, to large and spatially rapid
phase variations over the object; the rapidly varying phase in
return results in destructive interferences producing areas of diminished transmit and receive B1 amplitudes and hence nonuniform signal intensity and SNR [33].
The ability to manipulate the transmit RF is ultimately necessary to overcome the aforedescribed problem and perform
imaging in the human torso at ultrahigh fields. Our solution
to this problem was the use of multichannel transmitters with
channel specific independent control [48], [52], [53]. There is

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MAY 2014

often the misconception that using the Faraday shield of the
gradient set as a cavity and a patch antenna to drive it [183],
the so-called “traveling wave MR,” would lead to a uniform B+
1
field and spin excitation in the entire human body. However,
from the cavity, the RF must still “penetrate” into and travel
within the human body in the transverse direction and these
traveling waves within the body still create destructive interferences and, therefore, nonuniformities. Thus, the patch antenna
excitation must also have the means to shape the B+
1 within the
human torso, as in the multichannel transmit approach, for it to
be ultimately useful in human torso imaging at ultrahigh fields.
With the multichannel approach, particularly combined with
local transmit coil arrays placed in close proximity to the torso,
B+
1 fields can be maximized and/or homogenized over a predetermined region, enabling imaging of targeted organs in the
human torso at 7 T for the first time [48]–[50], [54], [65],
[184]–[186]. Fig. 10(b) illustrates that the problems that resulted in the poor torso images at 4 T have been solved using
multichannel transmit methodology combined with local transmit arrays even at 7 T, yielding exquisite cardiac anatomy, the
organ targeted in this study [49], [185]. Fig. 10(c) and (d) shows
B+
1 maps in a slice as in Fig. 10(b), demonstrating that normally
the B+
1 maps are inhomogeneous and also very weak [Fig. 10(c)]
over the targeted organ, the heart [49], [185]. However, with B+
1
shimming techniques, RF uniformity and magnitude are improved over the target [Fig. 10(d)], leading to 7 T images of the
type illustrated in Fig. 10(b).
Since the original work from our laboratory for body imaging [48]–[50], imaging in the human torso using multichannel
parallel transmit techniques and local multichannel transmit and
receive array coils have been adapted and utilized for human
torso studies by other groups as well (e.g., [4], [187]–[198])
and is a growing endeavor. These efforts have resulted in diverse coil geometries (e.g., [4], [48]). Significant further developments in this area are expected, including larger number
of transmit and receive coils, advanced pulse designs such as
multispoke pulses for improved B+
1 homogeneity, and significantly higher accelerations in image acquisition times through
the use of multiband technique for simultaneous slice excitation
and k-space undersampling in the phase encode direction(s).
Interesting extensions of the B1 shimming (i.e., one spoke) approach where two time-interleaved images are acquired using
a different excitation mode for each to form virtual receive elements (TIAMO technique) have been shown to significantly
improve homogeneity [188]. Two-spoke pulses have been employed with 16 channel transmitters yielding significant improvements in spatial homogeneity of contrast and signal intensity over the heart [65]; similarly, using the principles described
in [64], cardiac imaging with slice acceleration with parallel
transmit multiband pulses to optimize B+
1 with a power parameter regularization has been demonstrated [199]. Substantial new
improvements in such techniques are expected in the future.
An area where ultrahigh fields are bound to be extremely beneficial in the torso, as in the brain, is angiography and perfusion
imaging of organs like the heart and kidney using endogenous
contrast. Excellent angiography of kidney arterial blood vessels
was demonstrated using endogenous TOF contrast at 7 T [184].

VII. SAR CHALLENGE
One of the most significant challenges facing ultrahigh fields
is SAR (Specific Absorption Rate), i.e., the power deposited
into the subject. SAR increases supralinearly with increasing
magnetic fields due to the correspondingly higher frequency RF
that must be employed, and becomes even more complex when
multichannel parallel transmit (pTx) technology is engaged to
solve ultrahigh field B+
1 problems.
Regulatory bodies, such as the FDA in the USA, set limits for
“global” and “local” SAR. Even though appropriateness of these
limits and the science behind them are topics of ongoing debate,
they are the guidelines that define safe operating conditions.
Global SAR can be experimentally estimated, and all MRI
scanners are equipped with hardware and software to do so.
There are imaging applications, such as GRE-based fMRI, that
are intrinsically very low in global power deposition and can run
without encountering global SAR limits even at 7 T. But many
other techniques, such as spin-echo-based acquisitions for diffusion weighted imaging, spin echo fMRI, anatomical imaging
with “Turbo Spin Echoes,” etc., quickly run into limitations,
particularly when multiband accelerations are employed.
The greater problem at ultrahigh fields is local SAR. This is
especially of concern with pTx applications (although the solution to the problem is also pTx pulse design as discussed below).
There is currently no practical way of measuring local SAR experimentally. It can be calculated by electromagnetic modeling
for a given coil and an anatomical human model that occupies
the coil; this approach has been extensively used, including in
the very first 7 T head [21] and body [48]–[50] papers.
In a clinical scanner with a single channel transmit coil, electromagnetic simulations of a specific coil loaded with different
anatomical human models are employed to establish a correlation between global SAR and local SAR for that coil. This
correlation, including a safety margin that accounts for possible variations among individuals, is then employed to abide by
global and local SAR limits based on the experimental measurement of global SAR alone. However, this approach completely
fails for pTx. In a pTx application, amplitudes and phases of the
different current carrying elements (i.e., the different transmit
channels) no longer have a hardware-fixed relationship as they
do in a single transmit coil setup; instead they are now uniquely
determined based on the B+
1 maps obtained on each individual subject, the targeted region to be imaged, and the pTx RF
solution employed.
Therefore, ideally, the pTx approach requires calculation of
local SAR for each individual subject and for the pTx RF solution sought. Currently, this is far from being feasible within the
time dictated by constraints of an MR imaging session. Consequently, one must rely on generic models. Solutions have been
proposed based on evaluation of multiple models and techniques
for a given coil configuration to set safety margins or employ a
library of models to estimate optimal matches (e.g., [200]–[202]
and references therein).
While pTx technology introduces complications with respect
to local SAR, it also provides a solution for the SAR imposed
limitations on power demanding imaging methods [50], [61],

Fig. 11. Sixteen channel pTx pulse design for a multiband RF pulse that
excites two slices simultaneously in the human brain at 7 T. The L shaped curve
quantifies tradeoffs, in this specific case, between total RF energy of the RF
pulse and excitation errors [i.e., root mean square error (RMSE)]. The crossing
between the horizontal and vertical dashed lines, labeled “Same fidelity” and
“Same energy,” identify the performance of the same coil operated in a circularly
polarized mode. Adapted from [64].

[64], [203]–[208]; this solution is in principle applicable to any
field strength though its utmost utility is at ultrahigh fields.
Most frequently employed strategy in pTx pulse design targets a desired spatial pattern of B+
1 (e.g., uniform flip angle
over a predetermined target) and searches for a solution in the
presence of a power related penalty term, such as local or global
SAR or total RF energy contained the pulse. This procedure
typically generates an “L-curve” that describes the performance
of the pulse with respect to the targeted performance (e.g., B+
1
uniformity) versus the regularized power parameter. Such an L
curve is illustrated in Fig. 11 for a Multiband RF pulse design for
7 T brain imaging using a 16 channel parallel transmit coil [64].
The crossing between the horizontal and vertical dashed lines,
labeled “Same fidelity” and “Same energy,” identify the performance of the same coil operated in a CP mode. At the same
RMSE as the CP mode, the RF energy of the pulse is reduced
significantly (∼60% for the same flip angle). The best compromise is where the L-shaped curve has an elbow, indicated by the
arrow (see Fig. 11).
When solutions such as the one shown in Fig. 11 are calculated simultaneously for multiple slices, either in the context
of simultaneous excitation of multiple slices with a multiband
pulse [145] or sequential excitation of slices for slice selective
volume coverage [209], the algorithm can minimize the local
SAR by distributing the “hot-spots” to a different location for
each excited slice. Consequently, hot-spots are not focused and
do not add up, thus minimizing local SAR.
Solutions have also been proposed to simultaneously constrain more than one power parameter [208]. However, all of
these elegant pTx solutions to SAR challenges still must be
calculated using a human model rather than on an individual
subject basis and implemented with a safety margin to account
for subject variability. This, of course, sacrifices performance.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In the last three decades, we have witnessed major advances
and refinements in techniques and instrumentation for ultrahigh

1374

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 5, MAY 2014

magnetic fields. The introduction of commercial ultrahigh field
instruments of ever increasing sophistication and robustness,
and the incessant pace of developments in image acquisition
and reconstruction methods have propelled ultrahigh field MR
imaging to new levels of biological information content. These
advances are sure to continue unabated for years to come as
the incessant creativity of the MR community produce new
capabilities and overcome impediments. As new instruments
like the 10.5 T system expected at the University of Minnesota
and the 11.7 T systems planned for the Intramural Research
division of NIH and NeuroSpin Laboratory in France come
online, further advances are expected.
With the introduction of highly sophisticated commercial instruments, utility of 7 T in clinical practice is also being considered; such discussions often invoke the concept of a “killer
application” even though one would, for example, find a hard
time identifying a “killer application” that propelled 3 T into the
clinical arena. Nevertheless, there are numerous cases where 3 T
imaging is better diagnostically than a lower field one, providing
justification for its preferred utility. Similarly, there are already
cases where 7 T is documented to be superior in visualizing
pathology than 3 T. More importantly, clinical utility of new
contrast mechanisms and measurement capabilities available at
ultrahigh fields remains to be explored.
Last but not least, the solutions to challenges encountered
at ultrahigh fields have been highly beneficial to lower fields
employed in clinical studies. This important benefit is often not
well appreciated. It is not that lower fields, such as the clinically
significant field of 3 T, do not suffer from problems such as
B0 and B1 inhomogeneities or power deposition limits. They
do, but one can “sweep” such problems “under the rug” at these
fields and still produce usable data. Not so at 7 T or higher fields.
Yet, solutions developed for 7 T, if applied, inevitably lead to
improved image quality at lower fields.
