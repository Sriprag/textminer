Abstract—Fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) could exploit the distribution of fluorescent biomarkers that target tumors
accurately and effectively, which enables noninvasive real-time 3D visualization as well as quantitative analysis of small tumors
in small animal studies in vivo. Due to the difficulties of reconstruction, continuous efforts are being made to find more practical
and efficient approaches to accurately obtain the characteristics of
fluorescent regions inside biological tissues. In this paper, we propose a region reconstruction method for FMT, which is defined as
an L1-norm regularization piecewise constant level set approach.
The proposed approach adopts a priori information including the
sparsity of the fluorescent sources and the fluorescent contrast between the target and background. When the contrast of different
fluorescent sources is low to a certain degree, our approach can simultaneously solve the detection and characterization problems for
the reconstruction of FMT. To evaluate the performance of the region reconstruction method, numerical phantom experiments and
in vivo bead-implanted mouse experiments were performed. The
results suggested that the proposed region reconstruction method
was able to reconstruct the features of the fluorescent regions accurately and effectively, and the proposed method was able to be
feasibly adopted in in vivo application.
Index Terms—Fluorescence molecular tomography, piecewise
constant level set, 3-D reconstruction.

fluorescence expression. Based on FMI, fluorescence molecular
tomography (FMT) is an imaging modality aimed at achieving 3-D visualization of fluorescence regions in tissues in vivo
through the solution of the reconstruction problem [10]–[12].
Because of its high sensitivity and low cost, the novel optical
molecular modality and its applications have been widely used
in small animal research and preclinical diagnostics. However,
there are still some challenging problems in FMT as following.
One of the problems in FMT is highly ill-posed and illconditioned inverse problem, due to that multiple scatterings
of photons propagate through heterogeneous biological tissues
[13]–[15], and uncertainty of light propagation inside the deep
tissue. Even though more fluorescence information can be captured by multiple spatial patterns of illumination, the problem
may still be strongly ill-posed because of the sensitivity to noise
and errors caused in the data-gathering process and raw data
discretization [16]. Appropriate priors or penalties are needed
to facilitate reconstruction and to restrict the search space to
a specific solution set. According to the existing literatures,
multitypes of a priori information have been adopted in reconstruction algorithms of FMT ranging from multispectral information to more involved sparse constraint [17]–[22]. The basic
idea is to reduce the number of unknown variables or to increase
the amount of measurements. Recently, the level set strategy has
gained its popularity in image reconstruction. Classical level set
methods were developed for modeling propagation of curves by
Osher and Sethian [23] and have been widely used in image processing applications [24], [25] and a variety of inverse problems
[26]–[28]. They provide a topologically flexible shape-based
formulation, elegantly representing multiple objects with complicated geometries. Being different from the standard level set
methods, the piecewise constant level set (PCLS) has been discussed in the field of image reconstruction [29]–[32]. It requires
only one level set function to identify an arbitrary number of
phases, which makes it simpler and require less storage capacity.
The other difficulty is that the numerical computation of
reconstruction can be time-consuming and inefficient due to
the large scale of datasets. Various methods based on convex
optimization have been proposed, such as the conjugated
gradient method, Gauss–Newton method, and interior-point
method, etc. [33]–[35]. Recently, the quadratic penalty (i.e.,
L2 regularization) is widely used, since it is simple and can
be efficiently solved by a large range of standard minimization
algorithms, such as Tikhonov method. However, the fast spatial
changes in the solution are often smoothed, and the localized
features can be lost during the reconstruction process [36], [37].
Unlike L2 regularization, L1 regularization can effectively
suppress spurious background signals and enforce sparsity,
which can preserve more details.

AN et al.: NOVEL REGION RECONSTRUCTION METHOD FOR FLUORESCENCE MOLECULAR TOMOGRAPHY

Consistent efforts are still being made to develop more advanced reconstruction methods for FMT. In this study, we proposed a novel region reconstruction method called the L1 regularization piecewise constant level set (L1-PCLS) approach,
which are aimed at increasing the accuracy and efficiency of the
reconstruction. In addition to describing the characteristics of
the fluorescent regions, we consider a priori information encompasses the sparsity and contrast of the fluorescent sources. Here,
we exploit the fact that while certain fluorescent probes target
specific biological tissues such as tumors, the fluorescent intensities of target tissues and nominal background have obvious
contrast [38]–[40]. Between different targets, we assume that
the fluorescent intensities have a similarity to a certain degree,
which is feasible when the targets are conducted with the same
cells and the concentration of the probe is uniform. To accurately
and effectively solve the L1-PCLS model, the alternating direction method and conjugate gradient (CG) [24] were employed.
Some acceleration techniques designed for iteration of L1-PCLS
were utilized to increase the efficiency of the algorithms.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we provide the forward diffusion approximation
model and the L1-PCLS model of FMT is introduced briefly.
In Section III, numerical heterogeneous phantom experiments
are performed to validate the performance of the proposed
method. Then, an in vivo bead-implanted mouse experiment
is used to demonstrate the feasibility of L1-PCLS in in vivo application. The results are discussed and this paper is concluded
in Section IV.
II. METHODS
A. Photon Propagation Model
For steady-state FMT with point excitation source, the photon
propagation model in highly scattering media such as biological tissues is based on the diffusion equation (DE) [41]. The
following coupled DEs with a Robin-type boundary condition
can be utilized to depict the forward problem [42], [43]

where r denotes the position of the point inside the image domain
Ω. The subscripts x and m denote the excitation and emission
light, respectively. Φx,m (r) is the photon flux density. μax,am
is the absorption coefficient, and μsx,sm is the scattering coefficient. Dx,m = 1/3(μax,am + (1 − g)μsx,sm ) is the diffusion
coefficient, and g is the anisotropy parameter. ημaf (r) denotes
the fluorescent field which is to be reconstructed, and v denotes
the optical reflective index mismatch at the boundary. In this
model, the excitation source is implemented as the isotropic
point source, which is located one mean free path of photon
transport beneath the surface [see Fig. 1(a)]. Θ denotes the amplitude of the excitation source.
By utilizing the finite element formulation to discretize the
photon propagation model, we established the linear relation-

the surface and the unknown internal photon distribution by
replacing the variables with the linear matrix equation
Φ = AX

(2)

where Φ denotes the measurements of FMT, A denotes the system weight matrix and X denotes the intensity of the fluorescence
distribution in biological tissues. Detailed descriptions can be
found elsewhere [14], [15]. Therefore, solving the FMT inverse
problem is aimed at recovering the fluorescent distribution X in
the aforementioned linear matrix equation.
B. Region Reconstruction Method for FMT
The inverse problem of FMT is aimed at reconstructing the
fluorescent targets according to (2), which can be directly solved
by inverting the weight matrix A. However, this inversion is often
ill-posed due to the fact that the dimension of Φ is usually much
less than the dimension of X, which makes A not a square matrix,
and the dimension of the null space of A is not zero. Hence, (2)
needs to be regularized in order to achieve a robust solution. To
guarantee the uniqueness and stability of FMT and to preserve
the details of fluorescent regions, the L1-norm regularization is
adopted in this paper. The optimization function with respect to
(2) is formulated as follows:
1
min E(X) = arg min ||AX − Φ||22 + λ||X||1
X
X≥ 0 2

(3)

where λ is the regularization parameter used to balance the data
fitting and L1 penalty.
To reconstruct the fluorescent regions inside the biological tissues, the image is assumed to be formed by piecewise constant
objects of interest on an unknown background. The feasibility analysis is performed beforehand. For a domain Ω1 ∈ Ω,
which represents the support of the objects of interest (fluorescent region), and Ω2 = D\Ω1 represents the homogeneous
background, as shown in Fig. 1(b), the corresponding PCLS
function describing the characteristic of the shape for each set

is defined as

(4)

Then the fluorescence distribution X can be written as
X(φ, C) = c1 H(φ) + c2 (1 − H(φ)) = ΨC

(5)

where C = [c1 , c2 ]T , Ψ = [H(φ), 1 − H(φ)]. In this formulation, the unknown values are assumed as the constant concentration values of the anomaly (object of interest) and background,
c1 and c2 , respectively [34], [35]. The characteristic function
H(φ) is defined as a smooth approximation of the step function
and the Dirac delta function

To avoid the bound overflow in region reconstruction, an
additional constraint function K(φ) is defined as
K(φ) = φ2 − 1 = 0.

(7)

In summary, the optimization problem of the region reconstruction for FMT is
min E(X) = min E(X(φ, C)),
X

subject to K(φ) = 0.

(8)
eq.(8) for the FMT system is clearly convex. To solve (8),
the augmented Lagrangian-based method is employed, which
is a combination of the multiplier method and the penalization
method

where η is a parameter vector called the Lagrange multiplier, μ
is a positive real number called a penalization parameter, and the
last term of (9) is a penalization term. Note that when K(φ) =
0, then the Lagrangian term vanishes, and L = E. Thus, the
optimization point of (9) is equal to the solution of (8). At the
optimization point of L, we must have

(10)

Since solving (10) for φ, C and η simultaneously is difficult
and time-consuming, we follow the idea in the classic alternating
direction method for solving these parameters. The flowchart of
the proposed method is illustrated in Fig. 2.
First, consider the optimization of the level set function φ,
which is realized via a gradient-based method [36], and an artificial time variable Δt is introduced
φ̃k +1 = φ̃k − Δt

where k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N is the iteration number, and N is the
maximum iteration number. To make the iteration continuous,
φ is replaced by a smoothed approximation φ̃ with an amplitude

Second, to consider the optimization of C, we need to calculate the equation

∂C
∂X k ∂C k
= [AT (AΨk C k − Φ) + λI]Ψk = 0.

(13)

It is worth mention that Ψ = 0 in iteration of φ. Thus, the coefficient matrix of (12) will be zero, which leads to the equation
AT AΨk C k = AT Φ − λI.

(14)

We adopt the CG algorithm [24] to update C when solving
(14). Due to the highly ill-posedness process in FMT, the updating procedure should not be implemented too early or too
frequently during the iterations. Thus, a fixed number of iterations γ1 and frequency γ2 are used to constrain the iterations
of C. Practically, the value of C is constrained in a predefined

AN et al.: NOVEL REGION RECONSTRUCTION METHOD FOR FLUORESCENCE MOLECULAR TOMOGRAPHY

1821

search interval [a, b] to further stabilize the iteration of C and
restrain the produced value within a given range.
Last, an updating scheme for η is constructed which the form
of the equation is same as the iteration equation of φ:
η k +1 = η k + μK(φk +1 ).

(15)

As the iterative intermediate result is close to the true optimization point, the iteration slows down. In Steps 1 and 3, the
parameters ε and μ need to perform minor adjustment to accelerate the iteration. One other thing to note is that neither ε nor
μ should be too large, which will make the iteration unstable.
III. RESULTS
In this section, numerical heterogeneous phantom experiments and an in vivo mouse experiment were carried out to
validate the performance of the proposed method. All computational processes were completed on a personal computer with
2.9-GHz Intel Core i7 CPU and 4-GB RAM.
To quantify the reconstruction results, the position error (PE),
contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and dice coefficient (Dice) were
utilized in this paper. PE was defined to analyze the location
error between the barycenter of the reconstruction region and
real fluorescent region.

of VOI and VOB, and σVOI , σVOB are the respective standard
deviations. In this paper, the VOI was defined according to a
threshold of 30% of the maximum fluorescent intensity.
Dice coefficient was performed to validate the similarity of
the reconstruction region and the real fluorescent region.

A. Results of the Heterogeneous Phantom Experiments
Heterogeneous phantom experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the L1-PCLS method. The heterogeneous cylindrical phantom is visualized in Fig. 3, where Fig. 3(a)
shows the 3-D view of the phantom, and Fig. 3(b) shows the
cross-sectional view of the phantom at the z = 0 slice. The diameter and height of the phantom were both 20 mm. Four kinds
of tissues (heart, lungs, bone and muscle) were used to construct

the phantom, and the corresponding optical properties were assigned according to Table I [15]. The heterogeneous phantom
was discretized to 4564 nodes and 24 333 elements for reconstruction. Two small spheres with a diameter of 2.0 mm each
were embedded into the lungs to represent the real fluorescent
regions. The excitation light sources were modeled as isotropic
point sources located in the z = 0 slice with a light intensity of
0.02 W, and the measurements were taken in transillumination
mode with a 160° field-of-view (FOV). Then, the photon propagation model and measurements were established using the
finite element method. In the experiments, 5% Gaussian noise
was added to the measurements to simulate the situation when
practical fluorescence measurements were taken using a CCD
camera. Fluorescent images in a 360° full view were collected
at every 10° (i.e., 36 projections were adopted). To simulate
the practical situation where the intensities of the fluorescent
sources are similar to a certain degree, the intensity ratio for the
two sources was set from 1:1 to 1:1.8 sequentially. To validate
the reconstruction performance, two conventional methods (L1IS and Tikhonov) were utilized to reconstruct the same datasets
while maintaining the same termination condition.
The reconstruction results of the three methods with different fluorescent ratios are shown in Fig. 4, and the quantitative
analysis of the performance for the three methods is listed in
Table II. The columns of Fig. 4 denote the reconstruction results
corresponding to different fluorescent ratios. The first, third and
fifth rows in Fig. 4 illustrate the 3-D reconstruction results corresponding to Tikhonov, L1-IS and L1-PCLS, respectively, while
the second, fourth and sixth rows illustrate the cross-sectional
views corresponding to the three methods. The white circles in
the cross-sectional views denote the real positions and regions

of the fluorescent sources. All the cross-sectional views in Fig. 4
are shown in the z = 0 slice.
To evaluate the performance of the reconstruction methods,
the PE, CNR, dice coefficient and computation time were used to
illustrate the robustness, accuracy and efficiency of the methods.
1) Robustness: When the intensity of S2 increased, the reconstruction results of the two targets became affected in
both the Tikhonov and L1-IS according to the fact that
the intensity of S1 was decreased in both methods. Particularly in L1-IS, the shape of S1 became more and more
diminished. For the L1-PCLS, the intensities of the two
targets were balanced due to the PCLS model, and the
regions of the two targets robustly stayed the same when

the intensity of S2 was bigger than S1. In fact, when the
contrast of the two sources was too high (the fluorescent
ratio is bigger than 1:2), all three methods could hardly
obtain satisfactory reconstruction results. This is mainly
because the reconstruction methods would automatically
trade the weaker target as background.
2) Accuracy: L1-PCLS achieved better performance in PEs
in both targets. When the fluorescent ratio increased, the
PE for S1 increased, and the results were better than those
obtained with the Tikhonov and L1-IS methods. Unlike
the Tikhonov method, the results of the L1-regularization
method acted out with a stronger convergence property
and fewer reconstruction artifacts. However, for the region

reconstruction, both the Tikhonov and L1-PCLS methods
could achieve a high dice coefficient. Due to the high
convergence property of L1-norm regularization, the
CNRs of the L1-PCLS and L1-IS methods were much
higher than for the Tikhonov. Owing to the balance effect
of the PCLS model, the CNRs of the L1-PCLS method
were not increasing infinitely.
3) Efficiency: For the same datasets, the Tikhonov method
required nearly 150 s to implement the reconstruction,
while the L1-IS considerably enhanced the efficiency up
to nearly 40 s. Owing to the relatively simple model and
accelerated techniques, the L1-PCLS took less computation time (nearly 20 s) to obtain satisfactory results
compared to the other two methods. Consequently, the
proposed method tended to be helpful and necessary.
B. Results of the In Vivo Mouse Experiments
To further study the potential of the proposed method in practical application of FMT, an in vivo experiment on an adult
Kunming mouse (Laboratory Animal Center, Peking University,
China) was performed with a dual-modality FMT and micro-CT
imaging system previously developed by our group [45]–[47].
The schematic illustration of the system is shown in Fig. 5,
which is mainly equipped with a cooled CCD camera, a continuous wave laser, a set of optical lenses, micro-CT equipment and
a rotating stage. The fluorescence measurements were collected
in transillumination mode.
The main process of in vivo experiments can be summarized
as follows. At first, the mouse was implanted with a fluorescent bead in the hypogastria. The bead was filled with a cy5.5
solution with a concentration of 2000 nM, and this fluorescent
solution had an extinction coefficient of 0.019 mm−1 μM−1 , with
a quantum efficiency of 0.23 at the peak excitation wavelength
of 671 nm, and the emission wavelength was 710 nm [48]. The
performance of the proposed method can be accurately validated
in this study, since the fluorescent bead was wrapped in a plastic

material, which could be easily detected by the micro-CT system to locate the real fluorescent region. The detector FOV was
160° and eight projections were adopted. After obtaining the raw
data including the fluorescence data and anatomical structural
data, some essential preprocessing operations were carried out
to prepare the data for FMT reconstruction. The original dataset
acquired by micro-CT was converted into 3-D volume data via
the Feldkamp–Davis–Kress algorithm [49], which is shown in
Fig. 6. In order to build the heterogeneous mouse model, five
main kinds of organs including muscle, lungs, heart, liver and
kidneys were segmented through a combination method of interactive and region growing methods [47]. The optical properties
for different organs were calculated according to [50], which
is listed in Table III. Then, the fusion of the mesh and the

fluorescence data was carried out via a 3-D surface flux reconstruction algorithm [51]. The heterogeneous mouse model and
the fusion are shown in Fig. 7. Finally, the heterogeneous mouse
model was discretized into 5639 nodes and 33 627 elements for
the reconstruction of FMT.
After finishing the above procedures, the reconstruction of
FMT was performed by using three different reconstruction
methods (Tikhonov, IS and L1-PCLS). The 3-D reconstruction
results of the three methods are shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8(a)–(c)
are the reconstruction results by Tikhonov, L1-IS and L1-PCLS,
respectively. The cross-sectional views of the results are given in
Fig. 9, where Fig. 9(c), (d) and (g) are the cross-sectional views
of Tikhonov, L1-IS and L1-PCLS, respectively. Fig. 9(a) shows

Quantitative analysis for the performance of the three methods
is shown in Table IV, which is also conducted by PE, CNR, dice

Similar to the heterogeneous phantom experiments, better reconstruction results were achieved by the proposed L1-PCLS

method. Owing to the number of projections for the in vivo
study is much less than the phantom study, there were more
reconstruction artifacts via Tikhonov and L1-IS methods, as
shown in Figs. 8 and 9. Even in this adverse situation, the proposed method could still obtain satisfactory results. Quantitative
analysis of the performance has further demonstrated the superiority of L1-PCLS. This means that the proposed method could
achieve reliable fluorescent targets in biological application.
IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a novel region reconstruction
method called L1-PCLS to reconstruct the internal fluorescent
regions for FMT. It is well known that the ill-posedness of the
FMT inverse problem causes relatively large errors in reconstruction. There are various kinds of methods based on convex
optimization and compress sensing to reconstruct the fluorescent distributions inside biological tissues [14]–[16]. In addition, compression methods have been proposed for reducing the
computational complexity of FMT [52], [53]. To solve the illposedness problem of FMT, the sparsity and contrast of the fluorescent region is used as a priori knowledge, and accordingly
L1-norm regularization and PCLS is performed in the proposed
method. Because the L1-PCLS function for FMT is clearly
convex, we adopt the augmented Lagrangian-based method,
which is a conventional tool to solve the problem of convex

optimization. As the FMT inverse problem is severely ill-posed
and the parameters of Lagrangian objective function can hardly
be solved simultaneously, the convergence speed of L1-PCLS
will deteriorate. Thus, the alternating direction method and CG
method are introduced to accelerate the iteration. With these
approaches, the proposed method can reconstruct the characteristics of the fluorescent regions accurately and effectively.
Owing to the sparsity constraint of L1-regularization and balance effect of PCLS, the reconstruction of L1-PCLS is neither
oversmoothed nor overshrunk. Thus, L1-PCLS is a novel reconstruction strategy for FMT, and it can reconstruct satisfactory
fluorescent targets inside biological tissues.
To validate the performance of L1-PCLS, we performed numerical heterogeneous phantom experiments and in vivo mouse
experiments. For comparison, the L1-IS and Tikhonov methods
were adopted. The experimental results indicated that L1-PCLS
was capable of obtaining accurate features of the fluorescent
regions. In numerical phantom experiments with the dual fluorescent source case and different fluorescent ratios, L1-PCLS
maintained reliable reconstruction results, and the performance
of the proposed method was illustrated via PE, CNR, and Dice
coefficient of the reconstruction results. The reconstruction results of the in vivo mouse experiments validated the feasibility
of L1-PCLS in an in vivo application, and the features of the
reconstruction regions obtained by L1-PCLS were better than
the two conventional methods, which demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in in vivo application. Besides, the
computation time of L1-PCLS was substantially satisfactory in
both numerical phantom experiments and in vivo experiments,
which illustrated the efficiency of the proposed method.
It should be noted that incorrect parameters used in the algorithms might reduce the performance of the proposed method.
The adaptive parameter achievement algorithms should be studied further. Besides, other performances of the proposed method,
such as spatial resolution and depth sensitivity, should be systematically tested.
