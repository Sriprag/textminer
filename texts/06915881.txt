EMG and Kinematic Responses to Unexpected Slips
After Slip Training in Virtual Reality
Prakriti Parijat, Thurmon E. Lockhart, and Jian Liu∗

Abstract—The objective of the study was to design a virtual
reality (VR) training to induce perturbation in older adults similar to a slip and examine the effect of the training on kinematic
and muscular responses in older adults. Twenty-four older adults
were involved in a laboratory study and randomly assigned to
two groups (VR training and control). Both groups went through
three sessions including baseline slip, training, and transfer of
training on slippery surface. The training group experienced 12
simulated slips using a visual perturbation induced by tilting a
VR scene while walking on the treadmill and the control group
completed normal walking during the training session. Kinematic,
kinetic, and electromyography data were collected during all the
sessions. Results demonstrated the proactive adjustments such as
increased trunk flexion at heel contact after training. Reactive
adjustments included reduced time to peak activations of knee
flexors, reduced knee coactivation, reduced time to trunk flexion, and reduced trunk angular velocity after training. In conclusion, the study findings indicate that the VR training was able
to generate a perturbation in older adults that evoked recovery
reactions and such motor skill can be transferred to the actual
slip trials.

I. INTRODUCTION
ALL accidents are one of the most serious problems leading to unintentional injuries and fatalities. Slip-induced
falls are responsible for 87% of all hip fractures, leading to a
loss of functional independence and increase in fear for future
falls in adults aged 65 years and older [1]. Current proactive intervention strategies for older adults (i.e., strength, endurance,
balance training) have produced inconsistent results on the success of these exercise programs [2]. One of the reasons for such
inconsistency in the effectiveness of the existing fall prevention
exercises could be that they do not target the specific neuromuscular skills required for fall prevention.
There is an increasing application of virtual reality (VR) environments to investigate various aspects of human balance

and control [3], [4]. VR is an excellent approach to generate
simulated, interactive, and multidimensional environments on a
head-mounted display (HMD) or on a computer monitor. One
of the primary benefits of adopting VR is that individuals can
be challenged in a safe environment, while keeping control over
stimulus delivery and measurement [5]. Balance rehabilitation
using VR follows the principle of ego-motion which states that
varying VR environments induce a visual-vestibular sensory
conflict, thus perturbing the natural stance requiring reactive
responses taken to maintain stability [6].
VR training (VRT) has been applied to the rehabilitation of
various motor functions in patients with vestibular disorders
[7], to improve mobility in individuals with impaired spatial
abilities and, to train balance control [8]. Recently, VR environments have been used to promote gait training. Fung et al.
[9] used a treadmill and motion coupled VR system for gait
training in older adults with movement disorders. With repeated
practice, participants were able to improve gait speed and were
able to avoid obstacle collision. Similarly, Nyberg et al. [4]
demonstrated changes in walking speed and stride length, and
balance reactions in individuals when exposed to an immersive
VR environment.
Recently, VR environments were used to investigate the risk
of falling associated with aging [10]. It was found that visual
motion induced greater joint angle displacements in the joints
of the lower limb in the older adults compared to younger counterparts. These results indicate a strong influence of visual feedback in older adults to maintain balance [10]. In general, older
adults tend to rely more on visual feedback for postural control
and recovering from a slip-induced fall [11], [12]. Similarly,
Bugnariu et al. [13] observed that when the virtual environment was manipulated to provide distorted visual perception,
older adults took more steps to maintain upright stance and
had delayed onset of muscle activity. This may be due to the
impairments of sensory organization in older adults [13], [14].
Additionally, older adults initiated balance reactions by activating their neck muscles first, suggesting an excessive reliance on
visual inputs or need for head stabilization.
Currently, no studies are available that aims to improve recovery reactions in older adults using VRT. Based on previous
findings, if a VR environment is created to induce repeated virtual slips via visual-vestibular conflict, individuals may elicit
recovery responses similar to an actual slip. Therefore, there is
a need to develop a VRT program targeting slip-induced falls,
and to evaluate whether the training results can be transferred
to an actual slip. There is also a gap in knowledge regarding the neuromuscular mechanism to recover from such VR
perturbations.

and the HMD along with the virtual scene.

The objective of the study was to design a VRT to induce
perturbation in older adults similar to a slip and examine the
training effect on kinematic and muscular responses in older
adults. The specific aims for the study were: 1) to evaluate the
effect of VRT in improving angular and muscular responses in
older adults when exposed to an actual slippery surface; and 2)
to quantify the angular and muscular changes during the VRT.
II. METHODS
A. Subjects
A laboratory study was conducted involving 24 healthy older
adults (>65 years, 12 male, and 12 female). Their demographics
are summarized in Table I.
Informed consent was approved by local Institutional Review
Board and was obtained from the participants. Participants were
randomly placed into a control group (n = 12), and a VRT group
(n = 12).
B. Apparatus
An instrumented treadmill (Nordick, T7 si, NY, USA) was
utilized to conduct the VRT. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the VR scene
was rendered on an HMD (Glasstron LDI-100B Sony, with a 28°
horizontal field of view in each eye). The HMD had two 0.7-in
liquid crystal display screens whose images combine to give
the effect of viewing a 30-in screen 1.2 m away. The HMD was

lightweight (120 mg) and had a resolution of 832(H) × 624(V).
Any peripheral vision of the external environment was blocked
by the foam blinders attached to the HMD. A typical downtown
VR scene was generated (see Fig. 1) with buildings, light poles,
road, pavement, street signs, etc. The scene was shown at a
frame rate of 64 Hz. The HMD was equipped with a tracker
(Fastrak, Polhemus, VT, USA), which allowed participants to
rotate their head and feel the virtual environment in all directions
(6 dof—X, Y, Z, pitch, yaw, and roll). The virtual slip was created
by perturbations (tilts) in the pitch plane of the VR scene at
random intervals. The lights in the laboratory were turned off
during the training trials.
The slip trials were conducted on 15 m long walkway embedded with two force plates (Type 45550-08, Bertec). The slippery
surface was covered with a 1:1 water and jelly mixture to reduce
the coefficient of friction (COF) (dynamic COF = 0.12) of the
floor surface. Participants were unaware of the position of this
surface as the force plates were covered with the same vinyl
as the walkway. This is a standardized protocol used in several
previous slip and fall studies [11], [15].
A six-camera optical motion capture system (Qualisys, Sweden) was used to measure full-body kinematics at a sampling
rate of 100 Hz. A full-body biomechanical model [16] with 24
reflective markers was adopted in the study. Kinetic data were
measured at 1000 Hz by the force plates (embedded on the
walkway). An eight-channel electromyography (EMG) telemetry Myosystem 2000 (Noraxon, USA) was used to record bilateral temporal activations from vastus lateralis (VL), medial
hamstring (MH), tibialis anterior (TA), and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles of the lower extremity. The EMG data were
sampled at 1000 Hz. The force plates and EMG system were
connected to a 16 bit, 64 analog-input, DAQ card (PCI-6031E,
100 kS/s, NI, USA). The data collection from the Qualysis, force
plates, and EMG system was synchronized using a customized
LabVIEW program. Participants were protected by an overhead
fall-arresting harness throughout the experiment [16]. Uniform
clothes and athletic shoes were provided to all participants.
C. Procedure
The entire study involved three sessions: baseline measure,
training acquisition, and transfer of training, on three separate
days. All participants went through a slip trial (Slip1) on the
slippery floor surface in the first session. On a separate day
(about two weeks later), the VRT group went though the VRT on
the treadmill while the control group performed normal walking
on the walkway. In the third session, both groups went through
another slip trial (Slip2).
Baseline measure (Session 1)—After attaching the markers and the EMG electrodes, participants were asked to walk
on the walkway for approximately 10 min at a self-selected
pace to familiarize them with the harness and the lab environment. A metronome was used to record and regulate participants’ self-selected pace to ensure consistent walking speed
between sessions. The starting point of their walking was adjusted so that their right foot lands on the second force plate,
which was switched to a slippery surface later. The baseline

data were measured from five normal walking trials before inducing the slip. Participants were instructed to maintain their
balance and continue walking even if they experience a slip.
Subsequently, an actual slippery surface was introduced without
participants’ awareness and the data were collected to represent
Slip1.
Training acquisition (Session 2)—The control group underwent normal walking for 10–15 min during their second session.
Data were collected from three normal walking trials during the
experiment. The training group went through the VRT in their
second session (see Fig. 2). Following the training, participants
walked on the treadmill at a self-selected pace for 5 min with harness. The initial baseline gait data (kinematic and EMG) on the
treadmill were collected to represent treadmill walking without
VR (TW). Afterward, they were asked to wear the HMD with
the virtual scene shown. The HMD was adjusted in a way that
the participants were able to look straight ahead. After a comfortable HMD fit was achieved, the visual scene started moving
and the treadmill speed was programmed to match the visual
scene (keeping both at the comfortable pace of participants).
Participants were asked to walk for 15 min with the HMD and
were allowed to freely rotate their head to feel the virtual environment, allowing for habituation of the VR scene. During
this period, data were collected at 5, 10, and 15 min to represent walking on the treadmill with VR (VR1, VR2, and VR3).
Following the habituation, participants were informed that a
slip may or may not be induced. They were instructed that in
case of a slip, they should try to recover their balance and keep
walking. A sudden virtual slip was induced by tilting the VR
environment from 0° to 25° in the pitch plane at a speed of 60°/s.
The experimenter manually induced the virtual slip by pressing
a computer key at random intervals during the heel contacts of
the right foot. The choice of the perturbation velocity and the
displacement of the VR scene were based on a pilot study [17] to
evaluate the speed and tilt at which older adults may experience
perturbation.
The training paradigm was designed to include principles
known to enhance motor learning such as variability and randomization [18], [19], progressive overload [20], and individualization [21]. The training session consisted of 24 trials, with
two blocks of slips and no slips, followed by random variations of slips and no slips. After the first block of three repeated
slips (T1–T3), the speed of the virtual scene tilt was adjusted.
Depending on whether the participants successfully recovered
from the perturbation, the tilt speed was increased or decreased
by 12°/s (20% of the initial velocity) for the next block of slip
trials (T4–T6). It was believed that the decrease in velocity
would provide a better opportunity for successful recovery if

595

failed recoveries were observed, whereas the increase in speed
would provide greater challenge after successful recovery. Such
adjustment has shown to improve motor learning [2], [22]. The
last 12 trials included a random combination of six slip trials
(T7–T12) and various no slip trials.
Kinematics and EMG data were measured during all the slip
trials to represent T1–T12. Data were also recorded after blocks
1 and 2 to represent normal walking with VR on the treadmill
(VR4 and VR5). In addition, data were recorded at the end of
the training session without the HMD to represent treadmill
walking without VR (TW2).
Transfer of training (Session 3)—Session 3 was performed
on the following day after the second session to avoid any confounding effects due to cyber sickness. For each subject, efforts have been made to schedule sessions 2 and 3 around the
same time period of the day to ensure consistent duration between training acquisition and transfer of training. The transfer
of training was evaluated on an actual slippery surface similar to the baseline measure. Briefly, participants were asked to
walk on the walkway at a pace that was matched with their pace
during the first session using a metronome. The kinematic, kinetic, and EMG data were measured prior to inducing the slip,
representing the normal walking trials. Following the normal
walking trials, a slippery floor surface was introduced without
participants’ awareness (Slip2).
D. Data Reduction
The kinematic and kinetic data were low-pass filtered using
a fourth-order, zero lag, Butterworth filter at a cutoff frequency
of 7 Hz [16]. The EMG data were digitally band pass filtered at
10–450 Hz [23], following which they were rectified and lowpass filtered using a fourth-order, zero lag, Butterworth filter
with a 7 Hz cutoff frequency to create a linear envelope [23].
Ground reaction forces were used to identify heel contact (HC)
and toe-off (TO) for Slip1 and Slip2. For the training trials on
the treadmill, HC and TO were identified using heel kinematics.
Subsequent analyses were performed in the stance phase of the
slipping foot.
Gait changes in VR environment—To quantify gait changes
while walking on the treadmill with VR, angular kinematics
(ankle, knee, hip, and trunk) and muscles activations (MG, TA,
MH, and VL) were assessed from the data that were collected
at different time intervals (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min). The lower
extremity 2-D sagittal angles were calculated using the marker
data [15]. Trunk angle was defined as the angle between the
trunk segment (mid point between shoulder and mid point between ASIS) and vertical. Muscle activity onsets of the slipping
limb were determined using a threshold of two standard deviations above activity during a quiet period of gait cycle. Ten
gait cycles from the normal treadmill walking were used to create a normal ensemble average profile due to the variability in
gait during locomotion [24]. Each EMG channel was peak normalized within subject using the ensemble average [25]. The
presence of muscle response burst is defined as increase in muscle activity that exceeded or fell below ±2 SD (either excitatory
or inhibitory) for >30 ms [26].

Proactive and reactive changes due to training—To quantify
the effects of training, dependent variables were categorized as
proactive responses that occur at the heel contact before the slip
is initiated, and reactive responses that occur after the slip is
initiated in the stance phase (HC to TO). As a descriptive measure, the frequency of falling was defined as the percentage of
the number of falls over the total number of falls and successful
recoveries for each group.
Reactive responses: The onset activation and the time to peak
(TTP) activation of muscles of the slipping limb (MG, TA, MH,
and VL) were used for statistical analyses. The onset activity was
determined as described before using a threshold of two standard
deviations above activity during a quiet period of gait cycle. Ten
control normal walking trials prior to the first slip were used to
create the normal ensemble average profile [23]. Peak ankle and
knee coactivity, and TTP ankle and knee coactivity after the slip
is initiated were used to quantify effects of training. The power
of the EMG activity was determined from the integrated EMG
(iEMG), calculated by taking the integral from onset to offset,
and normalized to the duration of the activation. Coactivity index
(CI) was calculated based on the ratio of the EMG activity of the
antagonist/agonist muscle pairs (TA/MG and VL/MH) using the
(1) proposed by Rudolph et al. [27]. LowerEMG refers to the less
active muscle, and HigherEMG refers to the more active muscle
(to avoid division by zero errors). The ratio was multiplied by the
sum of activity found in the two muscles. This method provided
an estimate of relative activation of the pairs of muscles as well
as the magnitude of coactivity
CI =

Peak angles, angular velocity, TTP angle, and TTP angular
velocities of the slipping limb were calculated to quantify the
effect of training on angular kinematics. The lower extremity
2-D joint angles and angular velocities were calculated using
methods described previously [15].
Proactive responses: Ankle, knee, hip and trunk angles were
calculated at the heel contact to quantify changes in angular
kinematics before the slip was initiated. The muscle (MG, TA,
MH and VL) onsets of the slipping limb along with ankle and
knee coactivity at the heel contact were used to quantify any
proactive muscular adjustments.
E. Statistical Analysis
There were two independent variables: group (training versus control), and training (Pre versus Post). To investigate the
effect of VRT on recovery performance, difference values were
calculated between the two slips (Slip2–Slip1), and a one-way
multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted
between the two groups including all the dependent measures.
If a statistically significant main effect of training was found,
subsequent univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to elucidate the effect of training on the dependent measures. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 11.5.0
(Chicago, IL) with a significance level of p < 0.05. In order to
verify the assumptions of MANOVA and ANOVA, all of the

data were evaluated for normality (using Shapiro-Wilk W test),
and sphericity (using Bartlett’s sphericity test). No significant
violation of the assumptions was evident.
III. RESULTS
The frequency of falling for the VRT group was reduced from
50% upon the first unexpected slip (Slip1) during the baseline
session to 0% upon the second unexpected slip (Slip2) during the
transfer of training session. For the control group, the frequency
of falling was reduced from 50% in Slip1 to 25% in Slip2.
Gait changes in the VR environment: General trends of angles during overground walking and treadmill walking with and
without VR are presented in Fig. 3. The figure indicates that
participants walked with an increased ankle plantarflexion, increased knee flexion and trunk flexion at heel contact on the
treadmill as compared to overground walking (see Fig. 3). In
addition, participants further increased their ankle plantarflexion
[F (6, 76) = 9.56, p = 0.02], trunk flexion [F (6, 76) = 12.56,
p = 0.001], and decreased their knee flexion [F (6, 76) = 10.56,
p = 0.02] at heel contact in the VR environment (see Fig. 3).
Post-hoc results indicated no significant differences in the peak
angles between the last trial of VR walking (VR5) and TW1,
suggesting that angular kinematics was stabilized after VR5.
The muscle activation profiles during the stance phase on the
treadmill with and without VR are presented in Fig. 4. In general,
participants walked with an early activation of MG, TA, MH, and
VL muscles at the heel contact during VR walking compared
to the treadmill walking. Significant differences were only seen
in the activation of VL [F (6, 76) = 9.86, p = 0.02] and TA
[F (6, 76) = 10.48, p = 0.01] muscles between VR5 and TW1.
No significant differences were observed in the activation of MG
and MH muscles between VR walking and treadmill walking.
Reactive changes after slip onset: The ANOVA indicated no
significant differences in the peak ankle angle between groups.
There was a decrease in the peak knee flexion and peak hip

muscle activation, no significant effect of group was found in
the onset of muscles at heel contact. No significant effect was
found in the ankle and knee coactivity between groups.
Proactive and reactive strategies during VRT: The proactive
changes at heel contact were observed from T1 to T12 trials.
Participants walked with an increased trunk flexion, ankle plantarflexion (see Fig. 7), and knee flexion at heel contact from T1
to T2 trial, which reduced by T6 trial and remained unchanged
from T6 to T12 trials. In terms of muscle activity, participants
had an early activation of all the muscles of the slipping limb
at heel contact from T1 to T2 trial, which remained unchanged
until T5 trial. During the subsequent trials, early onset was only
seen for VL and TA muscles.

flexion angle in the VRT group compared to control, but the
differences were not significant (see Table II). The peak ankle,
knee, and hip angular velocity after slip-start decreased from
Slip1 to Slip2 trials in both VRT and control group, but no
significant differences were observed between groups.
A significant training effect was found in the peak trunk extension after slip-start [F (1, 18) = 12.46, p = 0.01]. Peak trunk
extension decreased more from Slip1 to Slip2 in the VRT group
compared to control (see Fig. 5). The peak trunk angular velocity decreased more from Slip1 to Slip2 in the VRT group
compared to control [F (1, 18) = 10.46, p = 0.01] (see Fig. 5).
Further analysis revealed a significant effect of group on TTP
angular velocities. The TTP trunk velocity [F (1, 18) = 10.46,
p = 0.02] and hip angular velocity [F (1, 18) = 6.45, p = 0.03]
decreased more from Slip1 to Slip2 in the VRT group than control (see Fig. 6).
The ANOVA indicated an early onset of MH [F (1, 18) =
12.67, p = 0.01] from Slip1 to Slip2 trial in the VRT group
compared control. Early onset of VL muscles was also observed in the training group during Slip2, but the differences
between the groups were not significant (see Table III). Along
with early onset, the TTP activation of the MH muscle decreased more from Slip1 to Slip2 [F (1, 18) = 11.55, p = 0.02]
in the VRT group compared to control. Peak knee coactivity
decreased more from Slip1 to Slip2 in the VRT group compare
to control [F (1, 18) = 21.34, p = 0.001]. Peak ankle coactivity
increased in the VRT group from the Slip1 to Slip2 trial, but the
differences were not significant compared to control. The TTP
knee coactivity decreased more in the VRT group compared to
control [F (1, 18) = 9.46, p = 0.01] (see Table III).
Proactive changes at heel contact before slip onset: No significant differences were observed in the ankle, knee, and hip
kinematics at the heel contact before the slip onset between
groups. However, participants in the VRT group had an increased trunk flexion at heel contact compared to control group
[F (1, 18) = 3.46, p = 0.04] during Slip2 trial. In terms of

This study explored the use of a novel VR perturbation
method in improving motor skills specific to reactive recovery from a slip-induced fall. Overall, the study findings support
the use of VR as a perturbation-based fall prevention approach
for older adults.
Cautious gait behavior was observed in the angular kinematics and neuromuscular responses during the initial VR walking.
Participants walked with an increased ankle plantarflexion, knee
flexion and trunk flexion at the heel contact, which is similar to
the findings in a previous study [28]. These kinematic changes
were coupled with neuromuscular changes such as increased
activation of MG and MH muscles during initial walking in the
VR. After walking for about 15 min in the VR environment, the
kinematic and neuromuscular activations approximated treadmill walking without VR. These results have implications in
developing future VR setups for improving gait studies. The
habituation time should be considered as one of the important
factors while designing a VR locomotion study.
As to reducing fall frequency, the VR slip training in the current study was found to be more effective (from 50% to 0%
versus from 41% to 0%) than the conventional moveable platform training [29]. In terms of angular kinematics, significant
differences were only found in the trunk kinematics between the
groups. During the Slip1 trial, both training and control group
extended their trunk at ∼130°/s before they were able to recover
from the slip. However, during the Slip2 trial, participants in the
training group extended their trunk at ∼95°/s and were able to
quickly reverse their forward trunk rotations by mid-slip. Reducing trunk rotations will have a significant effect in bringing
the COM of the body within stability limits [30]. Similar results
were found during the VRT trials (T2–T3) where participants
were able to reverse their forward trunk rotation after the visual
perturbations were induced. Recovery patterns of the lower extremity joints were not evident during the VRT on treadmill. It
took about 200—300 ms for the participants to react to a virtual
slip. Therefore, after the slip was induced heel contact, the heel
was traveling posterior to the nonslipping foot, and because
of which the recovery consisted of a quick forward stepping
response of the slipping foot, to avoid falling. However, due
to limited data and large variability, it is difficult to describe
transfer of motor strategies from the training to Slip2 trial.

Several neuromuscular adaptations were also observed in the
VRT group after the training. The onset and TTP activation of
the MH muscle of the slipping limb decreased in the VRT group
during Slip2 compared to the controls. Slower hamstring activation rate in older adults has been suggested as a potential risk

factor for slip-induced falls [31], [32]. The initial muscular reaction to a slip consists of the activation of the hamstring muscle
followed by other muscles [23]. This pattern is consistent with
the kinematic response to a naturally occurring slip, i.e., primary
knee flexion followed by knee extension. Early onset and the
reduced TTP MH activation therefore can help in stabilizing the
knee joint during a slip. Further reactive strategies include reduced knee coactivity of the slipping limb in the training group
during Slip2 trial. Similar patterns were observed during the
VRT, with an initial increase in the coactivity (T2 trial) and then

PARIJAT et al.: EMG AND KINEMATIC RESPONSES TO UNEXPECTED SLIPS AFTER SLIP TRAINING IN VIRTUAL REALITY

a subsequent decrease (T2–T3). Although implicated, a generalized pattern could not be reported due to the lack of recovery
trials. In general, the iEMG activity of both MH and VL increased from Slip1 to Slip2 in the training group, with a higher
increase in integrated activity of MH after the slip was initiated.
No significant differences were seen in the ankle coactivity, suggesting a reliance on knee stability for recovery. Coactivation
of agonist and antagonist muscles is important for regulation
of joint stiffness [33]. It may be possible that after exposures
to balance loss in the VRT, the CNS chose the most effective
muscle synergy organization to achieve a common goal (i.e.,
recovery) with least energy expenditure during the Slip2 trial.
One of the primary contributions of this study is the application of VR environments in creating slip perturbation, which
has only been suggested in the previous studies [4]. In addition,
the study supported that healthy older adults were capable of
walking in the VR environment with a stable gait after habituation, which is important while designing future locomotion
research using virtual environments.
The study had several limitations. Participants adapted to the
virtual slips within 2–3 trials, and subsequent visual tilts could
not induce more perturbations. More importantly, future studies
may explore the retention of the training effects over weeks or
months on more diverse participant populations.
In summary, the study findings indicate that the VRT was
able to generate a perturbation in older adults that evoked recovery reactions. The main effects of training were observed
in reducing the reaction time to recovery such as reduced TTP
knee coactivity and reduced TTP trunk extension.
