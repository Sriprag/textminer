Multiple-Protein Detections of Single-Cells Reveal
Cell–Cell Heterogeneity in Human Cells
Jingwen Chai and Qing Song∗

Abstract—Cell population represents an intrinsically heterogeneous and stochastic system, in which individual cells often behave
very differently in molecular contents, functions and even genotypes from the population average in response to uniform physiological stimuli. The traditional bulk cellular analysis often overlooks cellular heterogeneity and does not provide information on
cell–cell variations. Single-cell measurements can reveal information obscured in population averages, and enable us to determine
distributions rather than averaged properties within a cell population. The level of complexity, with numerous variables acting at the
same time, requires multiparametric and dynamic investigation of
a large number of single cells. Multiplexed study can provide quantitative correlations or inter-relationships among multiple cellular
components and molecular markers within a protein network or
family in biological processes. In this paper, we applied multiple
fluorophore-conjugated primary antibodies to detect multiple proteins expressed on the same singe cells from a clonal population. To
reveal cell–cell heterogeneity, we quantified the histograms of six
proteins within a cell population as functions of TNF-α stimulation
time. Then, we quantified noise and noise strength of these protein
histograms as functions of TNF-α stimulation time. Thirdly, we
quantified correlation coefficients of multiple proteins expressed on
same single-cells as functions of TNF-α stimulation time. Above parameters demonstrated nonlinear relationships with TNF-α stimulation. Quantification of above parameters on independent cell
subpopulations further reveals the cell–cell heterogeneity when
exposed to identical environmental conditions. Such cellular heterogeneity will be useful to characterize the disease progression
and disease diagnoses.
Index Terms—Cell–cell heterogeneity, cell–cell variability, endothelial inflammation, multiple protein detection, single-cell
analysis.

I. INTRODUCTION
ELLS are the fundamental building blocks of life. Cell
population stands for an intrinsically heterogeneous and
stochastic system with a high level of spatiotemporal complexity [1]–[3]. Cellular heterogeneity has been observed in many
physiological processes [4], [5]. Cellular heterogeneity within
cancer, neurons, and stem cells is particularly pronounced [6],

[7]. Exposed to the same environmental conditions, genetically
identical cells show significant variations in molecular contents
and marked differences in phenotypic characteristics [8]. Such
cell–cell heterogeneity can be important to many biological processes, such as disease progression, and will have important consequences for the health and function of the entire population
of cells.
Currently, cells are commonly analyzed in ensembles, i.e.,
thousands of cells per sample, yielding results on the average response of all cells. However, it is the individual cell that matters.
A recent investigation reveals that the genomic rearrangements
create the differences within the cell population at the singlecell level, and resulted differences create subpopulations of cells
contributing to tumor formation and metastasis [9]. Traditional
bulk cellular analyses often overlook cellular heterogeneity and
are unable to characterize intracellular heterogeneity, such as,
different patterns of immune responses, cell–cell variability of
expression of proteins, metabolites, etc. These information, can
only be obtained by single-cell assays. As a consequence, positive cellular drug responses could be obscured by cell–cell
heterogeneity [10]. Single-cell measurements will unveil information obscured in population averages [11], and enable us to
determine distributions rather than averaged properties within a
cell population.
Proteins are organized into extensive networks that allow cells
to respond and adapt to their environment [12]–[14]. The activity of an individual protein depends on not only its abundance
but also the interacting networks. It is becoming clear that single biological measurement is not capable of truly characterizing even the simplest systems. The level of complexity, with
numerous variables acting at the same time, requires multiparametric and dynamic investigation of a large number of single
cells. Multiplexed study will provide quantitative correlations
or inter-relationships among multiple cellular components and
molecular markers within a protein network or family in biological processes. The behavior of system of proteins can be
understood comprehensively only by treating the network as
a whole. Simultaneously measuring multiple cellular components, such as proteins, is also crucial to clinical diagnoses and
multidimensional drug profiling [16], [17].
Protein expression could be a stochastic process that results in
phenotypic, and functional differences among cells. The intracellular heterogeneity of expression of protein levels in human
cells are not well characterized so far. Stochasticity of protein
expression exhibits not only in the temporal information of a single cell but also in a cell population distribution at a particular
time. A distribution of cellular behaviors can be estimated from
a large number of single cells at a single time point and/or over

time. A histogram will characterize a quantitative trait which is
distributed across a cell population [18]. The cell–cell variability, defined as noise, is reflected in the width of a cell population
distribution, or histogram. Mathematically, noise can be calculated as the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean
expression level of the cell population [14], [19]–[21]. Noise
strength can be calculated by the variance divided by the mean
expression level of the cell population [14], [21]–[23]. Study of
protein networks allows us to investigate how stochastic effects
at different parts of a network affect expression outcomes [14].
Although flow cytometry is a powerful and high-throughput
tool for studying single cells, most experiments produce only
end point data. It can neither follow single-cell behavior by
time-lapse imaging for temporal information nor capture images of whole cells to yield spatial information. Moreover, these
cells have to be fixed specifically for intracellular staining. Further, flow cytometric techniques can only be applied to cells
in suspension and cannot directly show whether the identified
molecules have a functional role in the cellular process under
investigation. Microscopy can reveal the existence of phenotypically distinct cellular subpopulations at a single-cell level.
In this study, an in vitro endothelial inflammation was used
as a model system. Multiple proteins involved in the endothelial inflammation, such as toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4), P-Selectin (CD62P), E-Selectin (CD62E),
intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1 or CD54) and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM1 or CD106) [24]–[26], [31],
were chosen as protein candidates for this study. We measured
multiple proteins on single cells using fluorescence microscopy.
We constructed the histograms of protein expression by drawing
the frequency versus the median normalized protein expression
level from a large number of single cells. Cell–cell heterogeneity was disclosed by quantifying noise, noise strength of protein
distribution histograms and correlation coefficients for multiple
proteins expressed on same-single-cells over TNF-α stimulation
time. Cell–cell heterogeneity was further divulged by quantifying noise, noise strength, correlation coefficients among independent cell subpopulations exposed to the same environmental
stimulation condition (TNF-α stimulation time).

anti-human antibody reactive to protein CD62E was customer
conjugated to AF 660 using Zenon labeling kits, which was
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). The customerconjugation follows the manufacturer’s instruction.

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS

MFI measurements were made from cells imaged using the
40× oil emission objective lens. For single-cell measurements,
a single cell was outlined using its phase image and MFIs of
three proteins were quantified using the LSM 510 software. Cell
number N is used to describe the size of a cell population. We
used total of 300 cells (N = 300) for our single-cell analyses.

A. Materials and Chemicals
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), fetal
bovine serum (FBS), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 100×
penicillin-streptomycin stock solution, and 0.5% trypsin0.02% EDTA stock solution were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemicals (St. Louis, MO, USA). Fluorescently conjugated
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used for immunofluorescence
were R-phycoerythrin (PE) anti-human CD284 (TLR4), Alexa
Fluor (AF) 488 anti-human CD282 (TLR2), AF 647 anti-human
CD62P (P-selectin), PE anti-human CD62E (E-selectin), AF
488 anti-human CD106 (VCAM-1), and AF 647 anti-human
CD54 (ICAM-1) (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA). Nuclei
were stained with 4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) contained in the ProLong Gold antifade mounting medium purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). The purified

B. Human Aortic Endothelial Cell (HAEC) Culture
HAECs, commercially purchased from Life technologies,
(Grand Island, NY, USA), were cultured in DMEM, 25-mM
HEPES, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 3.0-g/L
sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3 ) in an incubator at 37 ◦ C with
5% CO2 and 95% humidity.
C. Multiplexed Immunofluorescence Staining
HAEC cells were cultured to confluence in a 16-well LabTek chamber (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY,
USA), and settled to quiescence using cell culture medium with
1% FBS overnight. After stimulating the cells by adding tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (10 ng/ml) to the cell culture
medium for various periods (1–24 h), they were washed three
times with PBS, fixed with 70% ethanol for 15 min at room
temperature, and washed three times with PBS. Fixed HAEC
cells were blocked and permeabilized (PBS/1% FBS/0.2%
Triton X-100) for 30 min at 37 ◦ C. Fluorescently labeled primary
mAbs were added to the cells and incubated 1 h at 37 ◦ C in the
sequence of AF488, PE and AF647, followed by washing three
times with both PBST (PBS/0.2% Triton X-100) and PBS. Cells
were mounted in ProLong Gold, covered with #1.5 cover slips,
and sealed with nail polish. Fluorescence and differential interference contrast images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510
Meta laser scanning confocal microscope. TLR2 and VCAM-1
were immunostained with antibodies conjugated with AF 488.
TLR4 and ICAM-1 were immunostained with antibodies conjugated with PE. CD62P and CD62E were immunostained with
antibodies conjugated with AF647.
D. Mean Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) Measurements

E. Histograms of Protein Expression in a Cell Population
Protein i expression level (pij ) is defined as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of an individual cell j, and corresponding
average value of
MFIs of protein i in a cell population is defined

strength of linear dependence between two proteins expressed
on a same single-cell. Correlation coefficient R2 is quantified
as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of
their standard deviations.
III. RESULTS
A. Multiple Protein Detection
We cultured HAECs in 16-well Lab-Tek chambers till confluence (about 70%–90% confluence, data not shown). Using
traditional 2-D cell culture chamber (16-well Lab-Tek chambers), individual cells are interacted with each other, or cell–cell
interactions are not excluded in this study. Our statistical analysis based on measurements of individual cells within the cell
population of 300 individual cells which are interacted or communicated with their neighbor cells.
We detected multiple proteins like TLR2, TLR4, CD62P on
the same HAEC cell sample and ICAM1, VCAM1, and CD62E
on the other same HAEC cell sample. Fig. 1 shows the representative image of multiple protein detection on the same

cell sample. Fluorescence images demonstrated that some cells
expressed higher TLR2 protein levels than other cells. TLR4
expression level differences are also presented among different
individual cells as well as P-selectin protein expression level.
Fig. 2 illustrates a representative image of CD62E expression
levels in a cell population. Fluorescent intensity is varied among
individual single cells, especially in the higher magnification
image. Our experimental data supported that there is significant cell–cell variability in protein expression levels among a
genetic identical cell population [8]. The MFI of specific protein expression on a particular single cell was measured using
the LSM 510 software for quantitative comparisons. Negative
controls in which antibodies (Abs) did not target the VCAM-1
expressed on HAEC were also tested (data not shown), in which
fluorescence images only show nonspecific bindings.
B. Histograms of Protein Expression in a Cell Population
Fig. 3 shows histogram of CD62E protein expression distribution as functions of cell number. When the cell number N
increases from 25 to 500, the CD62E protein distribution (histogram) looks like a Gaussian distribution curve. The histogram
of CD62E drawn at the cell number of 300 is very close to that
drawn with the cell number of 500. In our study, we use N =
300 to characterize cell–cell heterogeneity.
Fig. 4 shows histograms of six protein expression profiles under different environmental conditions (TNF-α treatment time).
Histograms are plotted as frequencies versus normalized protein expression levels. Histograms visualize the variations in
protein expressions from cells to cells. Although six proteins
have different magnitudes of frequency versus normalized protein expression levels, histograms show similar patterns as a
function of environmental stimuli (TNF-α treatment time). Unstimulated (controlled) HAECs cell population represented a
cell population with a wider distribution or having bigger cellto-cell variability. TNF-α stimulation squeezed HAECs to narrower distributed cell populations. The stimulation exerted by
TNF-α on six proteins do not show linear effects but demonstrate nonlinear relationships with the stimulation time. The
stimulation effect of TNF-α on HAEC cell population reached
a peak at the TNF-α stimulation time of 4 h but this influence
gradually faded with the stimulation time. To quantify the stimulation effects of TNF-α on endothelial cells, we calculated the
noise and noise strength of six proteins as functions of TNF-α
stimulation time, as detailed in the following section.

CD62E protein distribution (histogram) as a function of cell numbers.

C. Noise and Noise Strength
Many factors can contribute to the intracellular heterogeneity, such as, intrinsic noise [19]–[21], extrinsic noise [19], [20],
stochastic fluctuations [3], [7], [8], [14], [23] in gene expression,
and genetic heterogeneity [27]– [29], etc., during the biological
processes. Accurately defining the contributions due to stochastic variation, local environmental heterogeneities, cellular or
phenotypic differences, and natural dynamic processes is still a
great challenge. In this paper, we have specifically studied the
intracellular variability regarding protein expression levels as
results of noises, noise strengths, and correlation coefficients.
As shown in Fig. 5, we quantified the noise and noise strength
of six protein histograms shown in Fig. 4 as functions of TNFα stimulation time. TNF-α stimulation reduced values of the
majority noise, noise strength of six protein distribution profiles. We found that the average values of normalized noise σ̄i
and noise strength ϕ̄i depended on the protein measured, and
ranged from 0.06 to 0.12 and 0.5 to 2.2, respectively. The general
trend is TNF-α stimulation reduced the noise and noise strength
profiles in a cell population. The influences of TNF-α stimulation on HAEC cell populations were dynamic and peaked
either at 4 or 12 h depends on specific protein. The stimulation
intensity varied as different proteins.
HAECs demonstrated the narrowest distribution profiles after 4 h of TNF-α stimulation for all six proteins. To explore the
cell–cell heterogeneity, we measured the noise, noise strength
of independent cell subpopulations for all proteins treated with
TNF-α for 4 h. As shown in Fig. 6, the noise and noise strength
demonstrate significant differences among these independent
cell subpopulations. The deviations of noise and noise strength
among the different subpopulations depended on the protein
measured, and ranged from 0.89% to 39.8% and 3.12% to
56.1%, respectively.
D. Correlation Coefficients R2
As shown in Fig. 7, we quantified the correlation coefficients
R2 of three proteins of TLR2, TLR4, and P-selectin expressed
on the same-single-cells in a cell population as functions of
TNF-α stimulation time. The specific values of correlation coefficients R2 among three proteins of TLR2, TLR4, and P-selectin
expressed on the same-single-cells as function of TNF-α stimulation time as well as independent cell populations are listed

in Table I. Overall, the majority values of R2 are close to 0.8
and can be as high as 0.965. This indicated that there were
substantial correlations among three proteins during endothelial
inflammation. The value of R2 of overall cell population in the
control sample was decreased at 4 h and gradually increased at
12 h and 24 h of TNF-α stimulation. This illustrated that protein
correlations were influenced by the environmental stimulation.
The different values of R2 among different independent cell
subpopulations proved that cell–cell variability contributed to
the stochasticity in protein correlations.
As shown in Fig. 8, we quantified the correlation coefficients
R2 of three proteins of CD54, CD106, and E-selectin expressed
on the same-single-cells within a cell population as functions of
TNF-α stimulation time. The values of correlation coefficients
R2 of three proteins of CD54, CD106, and E-selectin expressed
on the same-single-cells as function of TNF-α stimulation time
as well as independent cell populations are listed in Table II. We
obtained similar results as above three proteins.
IV. DISCUSSION
Protein expression is a stochastic process leading to phenotypic heterogeneity among cells [6], [27]. The variability or
cell–cell heterogeneity of protein expression levels in human
cells is not well characterized [28]. To reveal such cell–cell
variability, we detected three proteins simultaneously on the
same cell sample using fluorescent microscopy, represented in
Fig. 1, and quantified the dispersion of protein expression levels
in a cell population, illustrated in Fig. 2. Our experimental data
shows that the histogram of protein distribution in a cell population is close to a Gaussian distribution, as shown in Fig. 3. Our
experimental data also demonstrated that the dynamic behaviors
of histograms are also functions of TNF-α stimulation time, as
shown in Fig. 4.
As shown in Fig. 5, noise and noise strength of six protein histograms also demonstrated nonlinear relationship with
TNF-α stimulation time. To further reveal cell–cell variability, we quantified the noise and noise strength of six protein
histograms based on the independent cell subpopulations. As
shown in Fig. 6, under the same environmental condition, different values of noise and noise strength among the independent
cell populations reveals the cell–cell heterogeneity. As shown
in Figs. 7 and 8, correlation coefficients R2 also demonstrated
a nonlinear relationship with TNF-α stimulation time. Our

experimental results supported that significant cell–cell heterogeneity is present even in supposedly uniform populations such
as clonal cell lines. Our experimental results suggest that wholepopulation averaging of the protein levels may not appropriately
characterize its biological function [29]. Clonal heterogeneity

have different patterns of markers (presence or absence of certain proteins) and corresponding expression intensities. In our
study, to enable comparisons of cellular heterogeneity across
experimental conditions, a reference control set of 300 cells
was constructed for each protein from a uniform sampling of
control. The heterogeneity of a cell population subjected to a
specific experimental condition, i.e., TNF-α stimulation, was
estimated by comparing with the reference control population
behaviors. Independent subpopulation profiles based on 100 independent cells also revealed cell–cell heterogeneous responses
to identical TNF-alpha treatment. To improve the experimental
conditions of stimulations, we will culture cells under specific
cell density to obtain more uniformly spread cell culture conditions with equal number of neighbor cells. In the future study,
we are also interested in investigating the influences of number
of neighbor cells on protein expression levels.
Cellular heterogeneity is not yet well understood. Stochasticity (Stochastic nature) in biological mechanisms, i.e., the random element of both timing and molecular partitioning, will
produce an additional source of variability. Cellular heterogeneity of protein expression resulted from stochasticity exhibit not
only in the temporal information in a single cell, but also within
a cell population distribution at a particular time. Stochasticity
in protein expression is not necessarily an obstacle to invariant cellular behavior but may contribute an evolvable source of
advantageous population diversity. Subpopulations contribute
unequally to disease progression or response to either disease
progression or therapeutic intervention. Therefore, cell–cell heterogeneity can serve not only as a passive readout of population
state but also as a predictor of future responses to perturbations [6]. Our experimental data shows that TNF-alpha stimulation influences the protein levels, noise, noise strength, and
correlation coefficients. These influences demonstrate nonlinear relationships with the stimulation time. Our experimental
results support that cell–cell heterogeneity can be used to characterize the disease progression and can be used for potential
disease diagnoses [14], [30]. Our study also implies that cellular
heterogeneity contains meaningful information which can serve
as a biological function. This information can be useful to guide
diagnoses and treatment of the diseases.
