Early Warning of Acute Decompensation in
Heart Failure Patients Using a Noncontact
Measure of Stability Index
Faizan Javed∗ , Steven Farrugia, Michael Colefax, and Klaus Schindhelm

Abstract— Objective: Hospitalization due to heart failure (HF)
continues to be a major clinical and economic challenge. To reduce
hospitalization, this paper proposes a novel home telemonitoring
system for an early warning of acute decompensation in patients
with chronic stable New York Heart Association class II-IV HF.
Methods: It is based on deriving nocturnal respiratory related time
series using a noncontact radio-wave bio-motion sensor. The system generates an alert when there is a change in the underlying
probability distribution of the time series which can be regarded as
a surrogate marker of patient stability. Results: The system’s performance is evaluated using dual-site longitudinal data collected
from 104 HF patients over 12–24 months. The system reported an
average sensitivity of 0.62 to detect a change during an episode
of acute decompensation and an average specificity of 0.67 on the
blind validation set, when the frequency of alert was four weeks.
The system also performed well to predict acute decompensation
with an average sensitivity of 0.55 and specificity of 0.73 on the
validation set, where an event window was defined as three weeks
preceding an event. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that
the design and implementation of such a system is a positive step
toward developing noncontact systems capable of preventing acute
decompensation, reducing readmissions to hospital and ensuring
better quality of life for HF patients.
Index Terms—Change-point detection, noncontact bio-motion
sensor, probability distribution, remote monitoring.

I. INTRODUCTION
EART failure (HF) is the most common cardiovascular
disease causing significant economic burden, morbidity,
and mortality. In the United States, approximately 5.1 million
individuals aged ≥20 years have HF and this is expected to
increase by 25% in 2030. Projections also show that by 2030 the
total cost of HF will increase by almost 120% to $70 billion from
the 2013 estimated total cost of $32 billion [1]. HF patients are
also hospitalized frequently, with close to one million discharges
for HF in the U.S., in 2010 [1]. The mortality rate within 12
months of hospitalization is about 30–40%, and the readmission
rate is also high [2], [3].

The monitoring of HF syndrome is usually carried out during
periodic outpatient clinical reviews, which are rarely reflective
of patient’s physiological state at home. A significant proportion of HF patients experience acute decompensation between
scheduled visits necessitating urgent hospitalization. HF disease management programmes are in place to educate patients
to identify symptoms and signs of deterioration, such as weight
gain or increased breathlessness [4]. With home monitoring,
clinicians can identify early warning signs of fluid retention and
intervene as needed, either by reinstating adherence to optimal
diet and medications or by increasing diuretic dosage to avoid
worsening of symptoms [5].
Over past years, a variety of approaches to monitor HF patients at home, and variable combinations and permutations of
interventions have been investigated. Daily telemonitoring of
patient’s body weight using electronic scales connected to a
telephone line is the most commonly used approach. It was
initially hypothesized that daily weight monitoring could help
reduce decompensation because increases in body weight reflect
fluid retention, a sign of possible decompensation. However, the
literature suggests that weight gain on its own is not sensitive
enough to detect deterioration in all cases, because not all decompensation events are associated with observed weight gain
[6], [7].
Along with body weight, other physiological parameters including blood pressure (BP), pulse oximetry, heart rate (HR),
and heart rhythm (with a single-lead electrocardiogram) have
also been incorporated into telemonitoring systems. Studies
have shown no significant difference in overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or hospitalizations in HF patients using
these systems compared with controls [7], [8]. The use of wearable multisensor noninvasive external devices to measure and
transmit bio-impedance, HR, respiratory rate and volume, activity duration and intensity, and body posture are also utilized
to predict acute decompensation episodes [9]. Encouraging results have been obtained from studies that have investigated the
use of such systems; however, these devices have higher failure
rates and the requirement to wear them continuously is likely to
have a negative impact on compliance during long-term use.
Implanted devices are also able to measure physiological parameters on daily basis. These include intrathoracic impedance,
HR variability (HRV), nocturnal HR, episodes of arrhythmia
and daily patient activity [10]–[12]. Initially it was thought that
focusing on only one parameter, such as intrathoracic impedance
reflecting amount of lung “water,” might be sufficient [13], [14].
However, recent trials have suggested that trends in more than

one variable might be more useful [15]. Also, implantable devices come with some degree of risk and cost, and may only be
feasible for a subset of HF patients [16].
SleepMinder (SM) (ResMed Sensor Technologies Ltd.,
Dublin, Ireland) is a noncontact monitor of breathing patterns
during sleep. It is a bedside monitor ideally suited for noncontact
long-term monitoring of HF patients. It operates on the principle
of using transmitted radio waves to determine body motion, and
has been designed to detect movement of the torso, which is
dominated by respiratory related movement during sleep. The
device has previously received FDA clearance and CE-marking
for the measurement of respiratory rate. It is capable of sensing
movement and breathing over a distance ranging from 0.3 to
1.5 m; when there are two people in the bed, a combination
of sensor design and signal processing ensures that the device
measures only the respiration of the person nearest to the sensor
[17]. In previously published studies, SM has shown to characterize sleep parameters, respiratory rate and sleep-disordered
breathing (SDB) parameters with a reasonable level of accuracy
[18], [19].
Using the SM device, this paper proposes a novel telemonitoring system for early warning of clinical instability leading to
acute decompensation of HF. The block diagram of the system
is shown in Fig. 1. For practical deployment in this study, the
SM was supplied with a Bluetooth-enabled cell-phone which securely transmits the anonymized sensor data to a central server
on daily basis, for analysis. After nightly data have been received
by the server, signal processing algorithms are then applied to
the stored raw data to extract SDB event and respiratory-related
features. Change point detection (CPD) techniques are applied
on the extracted features to generate an alert which flags the clinical staff to further investigate the patient’s state. The system can
be transformed to generate alerts on daily, weekly or monthly
basis. The sensitivity and specificity of the system to detect
acute decompensated HF (ADHF) events will be determined
using data collected from real HF patients. Such a noncontact
system has good patient compliance and is less susceptible to
system failure.
This paper is organized as follows: Section II details the
methodology including subjects and data collection, event

definition, feature extraction, derivation of stability metric and
performance analysis. Section III presents the system’s performance on real-world data. Section IV discusses the major contributions of this paper and comparison with other developed
systems and concluding remarks are in Section V.
II. METHODS
A. Subjects and Data Collection
A longitudinal observational validation dual-center study was
carried out to develop and validate the proposed system. Medically stable HF patients receiving optimal guideline-based medical care, who had just been discharged following management
of an ADHF event were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were plasma
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level <200 pg/mL (58 pmol/L)
when reviewed in the HF clinic or history of any HF-related
hospitalization within the preceding 24 months. Patients were
excluded if they were aged less than 18 years, had unpredictable
sleep patterns based on work schedules (e.g., night shifts), had
cognitive impairment sufficient to interfere with proper use of
study equipment, and/or were already being treated for obstructive sleep apnoea with continuous positive airway pressure or
adaptive servo-ventilation.
The two sites enrolled patients of similar age, gender profile
and left ventricular ejection fraction (see Table I). The Dublin
population had a higher prevalence of hypertension and atrial
fibrillation, the latter probably contributing to the higher BNP in
this cohort. The London group had a higher prevalence of renal
failure, possibly explaining the higher prevalence of anaemia
in this group. Sleep disorder breathing (SDB) parameters were
calculated using the SleepMinder device on the first night of
enrolment to the study, since SleepMinder has been shown to
characterize these parameters with a reasonable level of accuracy [17], [20], [21]. These SDB parameters were similar in
the two cohorts, with both groups having moderate apnoeahypopnoea index (AHI) values.
Each patient’s respiratory pattern was monitored overnight
using the SM device. Data were collected in two-stages: a training dataset was first collected from 62 HF patients sequentially
admitted to St. Vincent Private Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, from

June 2010 to mid-September 2012. These data were used to
develop the early warning system, which was then tested on an
independent validation dataset consisting of: 1) data collected
from 42 HF patients sequentially admitted to The Royal Brompton Hospital, London, between September 2011 and March
2013, and 2) data collected from 26 HF patients at St. Vincent Private Hospital, Dublin Ireland between mid-September
2012 and April 2013 (a subset of these patients had previously
participated in the training dataset). The reason for this dualstage approach was to maintain complete separation of data
used for development of the proposed system and its evaluation, and therefore provide unbiased measure of the system’s
performance. The study design and protocol were reviewed and
approved by the human research ethics committee of the respective hospitals and informed consent was obtained from all
patients.
At the start of the study, once the patient was discharged from
hospital in a stable condition, an SM device was placed at the
patient’s bedside at home, as in Fig. 1, to monitor the sleep
and breathing of the patient. Data obtained were automatically
transmitted using a Bluetooth-enabled cell phone to a data management unit on daily basis. Patients also kept a diary of any
change in their diuretic dosage. All patients received standard
optimal medical care according to the NICE guidelines [22]
and the European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines [23] and were under active follow-up in their respective
HF clinics. Data from the SM device were not available to the
clinical team at any point, and patients continued to adjust their
medication as appropriate as part of usual care, and attended
clinic appointments as usual.

1) Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) events were
defined as:
a) Emergency HF hospitalization for management of
symptom deterioration and signs of HF with objective evidence of fluid overload (including elevated
jugular venous pressure and/or lung crackles and/or
dependent oedema and/or ascites; or chest radiograph evidence of pulmonary oedema or at least
50% increase in plasma BNP level from the euvolaemic level) and requirement for at least one
administration of intravenous diuretics; and/or
b) Clinical deterioration in HF managed at outpatient
level:
i) Type 1: Symptom Deterioration: Development of new symptoms of dyspnoea or worsening of established dyspnoea (manifest as
reduction in functional capacity and/or worsening orthopnoea and/or increasing or new
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea), or
ii) Type 2: Isolated Weight Gain: Evidence of
weight gain of at least 2 kg within 48 h and
decision made to increase diuretic therapy and
response of symptoms and/or weight within
48 h to the increase in diuretic therapy (if
symptoms do not respond within this time
course, patient is routinely reviewed in the
HF clinic, where the decompensations can
be confirmed and if appropriate the patient
is admitted to hospital to regain control of the
syndrome).
2) Nonacute decompensated heart failure (Non-ADHF)
events were defined as: hospital admission for cardiovascular reasons unrelated to HF or for noncardiovascular reasons. These include (but not limited to): anaemia,
gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, paracentesis, hypokalaemia, hernia, COPD, renal failure, arthroplasty,
chest pain, amyloidosis, enucleation, etc.
C. Feature Extraction
The SM sensor outputs two analogue voltage signals, I and
Q channels which are 90o out of phase (quadrature) and represent two estimates of respiratory movements from the torso. A
sleep/wake algorithm [20] was applied on the I and Q channels,
to indicate whether the current subject’s status is that of sleep,
wake or absent for every 30 s of recording. A proprietary algorithm [24] was then used to determine the level of activity and
movement based on signal power levels, signal morphology and
movement patterns. The activity level, as well as the duration
of movements and the time elapsed from the previous movement
were used as features to determine the sleep/wake state of the
subject. Respiration rate was estimated from sections of breathing signal that were previously classified as sleep by performing
peak and trough detection.
The apnea detection module was based on an initial selection of potential apnoeic events by calculating the correlation

JAVED et al.: EARLY WARNING OF ACUTE DECOMPENSATION IN HF PATIENTS USING A NONCONTACT MEASURE OF STABILITY INDEX

between the envelope of the respiration signal and a set of apnea templates. A potential event is defined as a section of the
correlation feature that exceeds a threshold of 0.5 for a time t
≥ 10 s. The amplitude of the bio-motion signal is proportional
to the cross-sectional area of the moving target and to the displacement of the moving target. It is highly correlated to that
of the chest and abdominal bands, as well as the flow and sum
signals [25], and can be considered an approximated measure of
the patient body movement. The morphology of the envelope of
each potential apnoeic event is analyzed by estimating the ratio
between the residual breathing effort (the minimum of the envelope) and the baseline breathing effort (the amplitude of the
envelope prior to the suspected event). An individual event was
accepted as a true detection whenever the estimated residual
breathing measure dropped to below 50% of its estimated baseline value for a time longer than 10 s, with the AHI estimated
from the total number of detected events divided by the total
measured sleep time [21].
These algorithms were applied in conjunction with other signal processing techniques to extract time-domain and frequencydomain features related to movement, activity, sleep quality,
respiratory patterns, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), Cheyne–
Stokes respiration (CSR)-related features including cycle length
(peak-to-peak time between two consecutive CSR cycles) and
modulation depth (change in amplitude from peak to trough in
every CSR cycle). In total, a set of 130 features were extracted
from a single night recording, that includes descriptive statistics
(mean, median, range, standard deviation, 25th percentile, 75th
percentile, 95th percentile, etc.) generated from the features
stated above. The algorithms used to extract these features have
been previously validated with high level of accuracy against
gold standard [18], [19].
Feature selection techniques that include differential evolution based feature selection (DEFS) and sequential feature
selection were then applied to select a subset of 25 features
that could best discriminate events from nonevent days. Further
four features were chosen from this set for change-point analysis, based on their performance on the training set in terms of
sensitivity and specificity to detect clinical events. These features were: 1) sdbEventNumber: the total number of detected
SDB events (apnoea or hypopnoea) in a night; 2) RespiratoryRate50th: 50th percentile of all the respiration rates estimated
during the night; 3) RespiratoryRate75th: 75th percentile of all
the respiration rates estimated during the night and 4) CycleLengthPeriodNorm75th: 75th percentile of the duration of all
cycles of modulated breathing detected during the night.
D. Stability Metric
A stability measure is computed using the statistical analysis
of the distribution of time series formed from successive values
of the extracted features over plural monitoring sessions. An
alert is generated if the stability measure exceeds a threshold.
The primary objective of the system is to have an early warning of ADHF events, therefore online change-point detection
(OCPD) was utilized which is most suitable for ameliorating or
preventing ADHF events with rapid onset, i.e., a delay of the

441

order of one week between the end of a stable condition and
the occurrence of an ADHF event. A retrospective change-point
detection (RCPD) approach can detect a change in patient stability with a delay of the order of one to two weeks, so it is
most suitable for events with more gradual onset, i.e., a delay
of the order of two to three weeks between the end of a stable
condition and the occurrence of an ADHF event. The following
section gives a brief overview of OCPD and RCPD techniques
and their implementation.
1) Online Analysis: This was based on Bayesian online
change-point detection (BOCPD) proposed by Fox and Adams
[26], [27]. It estimates the posterior distribution over the current
run length (which is the time since the last change), given the
data observed so far. Given a time series (x1 , x2 , ..., xN ), rt
defined as the length of the current run at time t, xt as the data at
time t and x1:t as the set of data (x1 , x2 , ..., xt ). The prediction
problem is equivalent to computing the predictive distribution
p(xt+1 |x1:t ) as a marginal over the run length

where xt t = (xt−r t +1:t ) is the set of most recent data corre(r )
sponding to the run length rt . p(xt+1 |xt t ) is computed using
the underlying predictive model (UPM). The run length distribution is computed recursively as
p(rt |x1:t ) =

p(rt , x1:t )
p(x1:t )

(2)


where p(x1:t ) = r t p(rt , x1:t ). The recursion relation p(rt ,
x1:t ) can then be derived by writing it as the marginal of p(rt ,
rt−1 , x1:t ) over t − 1

The sum can be made tractable by a simple update rule for rt
which can either increase by 1 or decrease to 0. Assuming that
the prior probability of a change-point is given by a prespecified
hazard rate h, then

This defines a forward message passing scheme to recursively
calculate γt from γt−1 .
The algorithm requires two initial parameters which are the
UPM and the hazard function H(r|θh ). The UPM is a simple
model of the time series x that changes at every change-point.

442

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 63, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2016

H(r|θh ) describes how likely a change is given the current
run length rt . We used an UPM as Gaussian observations
with changing mean and variance; assuming that the mean and
variance are drawn from normal and inverse Gamma distributions respectively, leading to normal-inverse-Gamma distribution, which is computationally advantageous

The above algorithm was applied to CycleLengthPeriodNorm75th feature by defining a univariate Gaussian Model
with parameters θm := [μ0 , κ, α, β] = [μ0 , 1/σ 2 , α, β], where
μ0 and σ 2 were computed using all the data available in the
training set. The stability measure St was computed as the probability at time t of a change-point having occurred since the last
change-point was alerted. This probability was computed as
the sum of the values of the posterior run length distribution
p(rt |y1:t ) over all lengths of run since the previous alert was
generated. That is, the sum is computed over all values of run
length rt up to the current time t less the time of the previous
generated alert

where the previous alert before time t was generated at time t0 ,
which was initialized to zero.
2) Retrospective Analysis: This approach works by comparing the probability distributions of subsequences of the time
series x before and after a certain time instant [28].
Notationally, a subsequence X(t) of length k of time series
x(t) is defined as
X(t) := [x(t), x(t + 1), ..., x(t + k − 1)]

(7)

where k is the input parameter assumed to be known. X (t) is
a set of n retrospective subsequence samples starting at time t
X (t) := [X(t), X(t + 1), ..., X(t + n − 1)].

(8)

Our primary goal is to compute a certain measure of dissimilarity
between two consecutive segments X (t) and X (t + n). We
used the dissimilarity measure of the form
D(Pt ||Pt+n ) + D(Pt+n ||Pt )

(9)

where Pt and Pt+n are probability distributions of samples in
X (t) and X (t + n), respectively. D(P ||P  ) denotes the f divergence

where f is a convex function such that f (1) = 0, and p(X)
and p (X) are probability density functions of P and P  , respectively. We assume that p(X) and p (X) are strictly positive. Since the f -divergence is asymmetric [i.e., D(P ||P  ) =
D(P  ||P )], we symmetrize it in our dissimilarity measure.

Since the probability densities p(X) and p (X) are unknown
in practice, one cannot directly compute the f -divergence (and
thus the dissimilarity measure). Recently a direct density-ratio
estimation based method is proposed for divergence approximation named as “unconstrained least-squares importance fitting

where θ := (θ1 , ..., θn ) are parameters to be learned from data

low amplitude alerts possibly generated by noise.
3) Combined: The BOCPD performed well in detecting
events that had a rapid onset whereas the RCPD was best for
events that were prolonged and had gradual underlying changes.
Therefore, a method combining the outputs of both systems
could help to improve the overall sensitivity of the system to detect ADHF events. We applied BOCPD on sdbEventNumber and
generated an alert when the probability of a change point under
the run length posterior, since the last alert exceeds a preselected
threshold which was fixed for all patients and applied RCPD on
RespiratoryRate50thPercentile and generated a binary output
once the output probability exceeds a certain threshold. The two
systems were then combined using OR logic to generate a single alert. The reason for using a simple OR logic was to cater
for the shortcoming of the RCPD method of not predicting in
the first (2n + k − 2 night) window.
Fig. 2 shows the combined CPD method for one of the patients. Fig. 2(A) and (B) are the sdbEventNum feature and the
probability of change based on OCPD. Fig. 2(C) and (D) are
the RR50th features and the rate of change based on RCPD.
Fig. 2(E) has blue markers representing the generated alerts
based on OR logic.

The developed system generated alerts on a daily basis, however to analyze the overall performance of the system in terms
of sensitivity and specificity to patient stability and how well
it related to the true reported event, patient data were divided
into fixed blocks of 28 days (four weeks). An event detection
window was defined as two weeks before and two weeks after
an event. Any alert within this 28-day window was considered
to be true positive (TP) meaning that the system was able to
detect a change during that event. If there was no alert within
this 28-day window, the system reported a false negative (FN),
indicating that the change was not detected. The sensitivity of
the systems was defined as the ratio of TP over (TP+FN).
The nonevent period was divided into fixed 28-day windows
starting from the beginning of the study. If a nonevent window
overlapped with an event window, it was shortened up to the start
of event window and the next block started one day after the
end of the overlapping event window. The alerts in these blocks
were used to determine the specificity of the system. Any alert
in the nonevent window was considered as 1 false positive (FP)
and no alert as 1 true negative (TN). The specificity was defined
in terms of blocks of 28 days as the ratio of TN over (TN+FP),
excluding blocks where no prediction was made due to missing
data.
Fig. 2(E) depicts the scoring criteria for one of the patients. There were two ADHF events and five non-ADHF events
marked with an arrow. The event window covering two weeks
before and two weeks after the event is shown in black for ADHF
and yellow for non-ADHF events, respectively. The blue markers show the output of the alert system. The system is able to
detect a change during all non-ADHF events but was unable to
detect a change during two ADHF events. The nonevent days
were divided into 24 windows, where each window had a length
of 28 days unless overlapping with an event window. The system
reported eight FP’s, resulting in a specificity of 0.67.
To assess the system’s capability to predict ADHF events,
the event window was redefined as 21 days prior to an event
and the nonevent window was defined as a 21-day window or
shorter if overlapping with an event window. The sensitivity and
specificity was also redefined accordingly. The reason for using
a shorter window size was based on the recommendations from
our clinical collaborators. They suggested that a time-frame
of 21 days prior to an event is most likely where the symptoms
deteriorate and is a reasonable time-frame where the alert would
be meaningful.
III. RESULTS
The data collected at St. Vincent Hospital between June 2010
and mid-September 2012 were used as a training set to estimate
the initial parameters of the stability metric. Of the 62 patients
included over time, 12 were excluded from the data analysis:
eight had ≤3 months of data due to death of the patient, two
were unstable throughout the study and two had poor signal
quality. The 50 patients included had 61 ADHF events and 64
non-ADHF events; of which two ADHF and four non-ADHF
events were excluded because there was no data 14 days before

and 14 days after an event. In total, there were 23 631 nights, of
which 21 659 had valid data.
Using the training set, a univariate Gaussian Model with
parameter θm := [μ0 , κ, α, β] = [μ0 , 1/σ 2 , α, β] was computed
using all the data available. Next, the run length parameter θh
and a fixed threshold on the probability of change-point under the run-length posterior were optimized to maximize the
overall sensitivity and specificity. For RCPD, the initial parameters were the lengths of data segments chosen as n = 10, and
k = 6 which implied that at time t, the system looked back at
the last 20 days, and estimated if there was any change in the
last ten days (t − n : t − 1) compared to the preceding ten days
(t − 2 × n : t − n − 1). A fixed threshold of 210 was used to
filter out low-level alerts, possibly generated due to noise.
Table II reports the results on the training data set from St.
Vincent Hospital. The analyzed dataset included 60 patients with
59 reported ADHF events and 60 non-ADHF events. All the data
were grouped together to calculate the overall sensitivity and
specificity of the alert system. The initial parameters were fixed
for all patients. The RCPD reported a sensitivity of 0.63 and
0.68 to detect a change during ADHF and non-ADHF events,
respectively, and a specificity of 0.69. The BOCPD system had
a sensitivity of 0.61 for ADHF events and 0.67 for non-ADHF
events with a specificity of 0.66. The combined system had a
higher sensitivity of 0.76 for ADHF and 0.78 for non-ADHF
events at the expense of a slight drop in the specificity to 0.60.
On an average, the sensitivity was 0.67 for ADHF and 0.71 for
non-ADHF events, with an average specificity of 0.65.
The validation set consisted of a combination of data collected
at The Royal Brompton Hospital, London, between September 2011 and March 2013, and data collected at St. Vincent
Hospital between mid-September 2012 and April 2013. Of the
42 patients included at The Royal Bromption Hospital, three
were excluded for having ≤3 months of data due to patient’s

death. The included 39 patients had 13 ADHF events and 16
non-ADHF events; of which one ADHF event was excluded for
missing data. In total, there were 12 687 recorded nights, of
which 10 730 had valid data. At St. Vincent Hospital, data were
collected from 26 patients, data was collected, who had seven
ADHF events and four non-ADHF events. In total, there were
4633 recorded nights, of which 3083 had valid data.
Using the same thresholds as in the training, the system was
tested on blind validation set. The test results are tabulated in
Table II. The RCPD system reported a sensitivity of 0.65 to detect a change during ADHF and 0.55 for non-ADHF events and
a specificity of 0.69. The OCPD system had a sensitivity of 0.50
for ADHF events and 0.30 for non-ADHF events with a specificity of 0.71. The combined system resulted in a sensitivity of
0.70 for ADHF and 0.55 for non-ADHF events with a specificity of 0.62. On an average, the sensitivity was 0.62 to alert
a change during ADHF and 0.47 for non-ADHF events with

a specificity of 0.67. As the validation set included data from
both Dublin and London site and some of the patients in the
Dublin site were included in both training and validation set, we
did analyze the system’s performance on individual sites just to
ensure that our results are consistent across multiple sites. Validating only on the London set resulted in a sensitivity of 0.66
to detect a change during ADHF event and a specificity of 0.64
which is consistent with the overall validation results presented
in Table II. To assess the overall performance of the system, the
receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve is plotted and is
shown in Fig. 3.
Fig. 4 depicts a real-time implementation of the stability metric system in the form of a dash-board, monitoring six HF patients. The raw feature, the 75th percentile of nocturnal respiratory rate (RR75th) is displayed for all patients along with
the alerts. Each alert is a window of four weeks. The green and
black windows are the TPs and FNs (covering the 14 days before
and 14 days after the event) for detecting a change during ADHF
events, yellow and blue windows are TPs and FNs for nonADHF events, respectively, and red windows are the FPs. The
blanks spaces are the TNs. It can be seen that Patient 4 and
Patient 6 had a large number of FPs but at the same time these
patients had a higher number of reported events, indicative of
instability throughout the study period.
The designed system was also assessed as a predictor for all
types of events. In this case the event window was defined as 21

days preceding an event and the nonevent window as 21 days
unless overlapping with an event window, in which case it was
shortened. Table III reports the results of the designed system
when analyzed as a predictor. The average sensitivity to predict
an ADHF event for the training set was 0.54 and for the test set
was 0.55, with specificity values of 0.70 and 0.73, respectively.
The average sensitivity of the system to predict non-ADHF
events was 0.53 for the training set and 0.40 for the test set.
The input to the developed system was sleep-related features
which were extracted from SM sensor using proprietary algorithms that have been validated with good accuracy against gold
standard [18], [19]. However, inaccuracies in these feature set
could undermine the performance of the stability index. To test
the robustness of the system against these errors, a simulation
was carried out by inserting Gaussian noise to the respiratory
rate data and artificially inserting change-points at regular time
intervals (by changing the mean and variance). The simulation
results showed that the stability index method is robust to small
changes in mean and variance of the features.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this paper, a remote monitoring system for early warning
of instability in HF patients at home is proposed. The system
is based on recording nocturnal sleep and breathing patterns of
patients using a noncontact bedside device and generating alerts

once a change in the underlying distribution has been detected.
The results demonstrate that the system had good performance
to detect patient state as well as to predict ADHF events.
To put these findings in context, it is worth briefly considering
other methods of remote monitoring HF patients at home. The
most widely used system is weight-based monitoring. Zhang
et al., proposed a moving average convergence divergence algorithm utilizing daily weights to predict worsening HF. Their
system was found to be less sensitive (0.20) with a 14 day event
window, compared to rule-of-thumb: 3 lbs increase in one day
(0.58) and 5 lbs in three days (0.65). However, the system had
much lower false alerts resulting in a specificity of 0.89 compared to 0.54 and 0.58 for 3 lbs in one day and 5 lbs in three days,
respectively [7]. Recently, Ledwidge et al., proposed a HeartPhone algorithm based on the application of moving averages
to daily weight data and the generation of alerts from deviations
above the norm for the individual patient [30]. They developed
two versions of the algorithm: 1) HeartPhone A (specificity optimized) with a sensitivity of 0.64 and specificity of 0.81, 2)
HeartPhone B (sensitivity optimized) with a sensitivity of 0.82
and specificity of 0.68 and compared their results with the conventional guidelines approach to weight monitoring: 1) 2 kg
over two or three days with a sensitivity of 0.21 and a specificity
of 0.86 and 2) 1.3 kg over one day with sensitivity of 0.46 and a
specificity of 0.71. These results were based on a study carried
out in higher risk HF patients and not on stable HF population
and also the weight data were available to clinical staff and
the cardiologist during the assessment of clinical deterioration
which might have influenced the diagnosis of HF events.
The potential use of specially-designed wearable devices has
also been explored. Parameters in addition to simple vital signs
and weight were explored in the multisensor monitoring in congestive heart failure (MUSIC) study [9] which used a multisensor noninvasive external monitoring device to measure and

transmit bio-impedance, HR, respiratory rate and volume, activity duration and intensity, and body posture. The investigators
utilized a development cohort to identify a single or a multiparameter algorithm with three components: fluid index, breath
index, and personalization parameters. Using all three parameters, the system reported a sensitivity of 0.65, a specificity of
0.90, and a false positive rate of 0.7 events per patient-year.
Though this technology seems quite promising as a continuous
noninvasive surveillance option, the failure rate of the device
was approximately 45%, reflecting the need for further enhancements. Additionally, the concept of a wearable external device
will have compliance issues for widespread use on a continuous basis. If feasible, such technology might have a role for a
defined postdischarge period.
Specialized implantable devices have also been studied with
the sole objective of monitoring impedance and arrhythmias to
decrease hospitalization. In the Chronicle Offers Management
to Patients with Advanced Signs and Symptoms of Heart failure
(COMPASS-HF) study, [31] a fully implantable device to continuously monitor and transmit right ventricular hemodynamic
parameters was implanted in HF patients. The right ventricular
pressure at the time of pulmonary valve opening was strongly
correlated with actual pulmonary artery pressures. The data were
reviewed at least once a week, and intervention occurred accordingly. There was no significant change in the primary endpoint
of HF-related events (hospitalizations, emergency room and
urgent care visits needing intravenous diuretics). A retrospective
analysis of the COMPASS-HF data did show a 36% reduction
in first HF-related hospitalizations.
The OptiVol/CareLink system (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) implantable device can measure thoracic impedance
which has been considered as a surrogate marker of pulmonary
congestion. Studies have been carried out to investigate the feasibility of the OptiVol system to predict HF events. Yu et al.,

JAVED et al.: EARLY WARNING OF ACUTE DECOMPENSATION IN HF PATIENTS USING A NONCONTACT MEASURE OF STABILITY INDEX

found that impedance started to decrease 15 days prior to worsening HF symptoms and reported a sensitivity of 0.76 and 1.5
false-positive HF decompensations per patient-year of monitoring [13]. In a more recent study of HF patients, Abraham
et al., showed that the sensitivity of intrathoracic impedance
monitoring was far superior to daily weight monitoring for predicting worsening HF events [32]. In contrast, the SENSE-HF
trial failed to confirm the utility of the same technology, and
also revealed many practical uncertainties such as unreliability
of impedance testing early after implant. The sensitivity to predict HF events was at best 42% with a positive predictive value
of 38% [12].
Recently, an integrated algorithm was proposed and tested to
identify patients at risk of HF hospitalization by Cowie et al.,
The system was based on estimating an HF risk score by combining changes in intrathoracic impedance, atrial fibrillation (AF)
burden, rapid rate during AF, percentage cardiac resynchronization therapy (%CRT) pacing, ventricular tachycardia, night HR,
HRV and activity using a Bayesian model [33]. Evaluation was
done every 30 days for the sensitivity and specificity calculation
outputting three risk scores: High, Medium and Low. Setting
a threshold below low and medium risk groups, they reported
a sensitivity and specificity of 0.83 and 0.46, respectively, and
the threshold between medium and high risk groups had a sensitivity of 0.41 and specificity of 0.90. At high risk score, the
sensitivity was 0.69 with a specificity of 0.72.
All the aforementioned systems require good patient compliance (e.g., the weight-based remote monitoring systems rely
on the patient to record their weight daily), are wearable which
makes them unrealistic for long-term use, or are invasive which
makes them feasible for only a subset of HF patients eligible
for implanted devices. Compared to these systems, the proposed
stability metric-based system uses a noncontact device suitable
for long-term monitoring without any patient compliance issues.
The system aims to signal a change in patient stability that can
help improve the efficacy of clinical management by allocating
more resources to patients with alerts compared with others.
The SM system has also shown to perform well in predicting
ADHF events.
The combined approach presented in this study was based
on simple OR logic which was to cater for the shortcoming of
RCPD of not predicting in the initial few days [which in our case
was 24 days (2n + k − 2)], other methods of decision fusion can
also be explored (for example, [34]) especially when combining
features from different data source like weight, HR, BP, etc.
The present study has some limitations that are worth
mentioning. First, it is difficult to know whether clinical events
have been correctly classified as being related to the underlying
HF because HF patients often have multiple comorbidities and
events can be multifactorial in nature. Given the underlying
physiological variability of HF, it is possible that an alert generated by the proposed system is actually detecting subclinical
events that may resolve spontaneously. Second, the trial was
designed to develop and test the proposed system without
influencing patient care. It needs to be emphasized that future
validation trials are required that include intervention from
clinical staff based on the generated alerts. Lastly, the designed

447

system is patient-independent which may not be optimal because
HF patients often have multiple underlying diseases. Therefore,
a patient-adaptive system may outperform the proposed
system, but would also have per-patient parameter optimization
issues.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper presented a stability metric-based system to remotely monitor stable HF patients using a noncontact device.
The system performed well on development as well as blind
validation data in terms of detecting a change during ADHF
events as well as to predict ADHF events. Such a system could
potentially be useful for ensuring clinical stability in NYHA
class II-IV stable HF patients, associated with improved quality of life. Future trials are being designed to evaluate whether
timely clinical interventions initiated based on generated alerts
can help reduce ADHF events and rehospitalization in HF
patients.
