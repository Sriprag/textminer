1. Introduction
Recently (Braun, Glänzel, & Schubert, 2005; Braun, Glänzel, & Schubert, 2006), it was suggested that the h-index,
originally proposed by Hirsch (2005) “to quantify an individual’s scientific output”, can be usefully applied to the
citation analysis of journals, as well. The point is not only to introduce a robust alternative indicator advantageously
supplementing journal impact factors, but also to gain deeper insight into the properties of this interesting but unusual
statistical measure. An amount of incomprehension that appears to surround Hirsch’s concept (and that manifests itself
both in unjustified refusal and in likewise unjustified glorification) stems from the lack of a solid statistical–theoretical
background supported by a sufficient body of empirical evidences.
The citation analysis of journals seems to provide a particularly appropriate field for experimentation, since – more
than in many other levels of investigation (e.g., individuals, groups or institutions) – there is a relative consensus (or,
at least a tacitly accepted tradition) in some basic conceptual and methodological questions. As the definition of the
journals themselves, the choice of the publication and citation windows, the categorization of journals into fields and
subfields and similar questions are concerned, there is a vast literature to refer to; first of all, the 30 years of the Journal
Citation Reports serves as a unique orientation pole—if not necessarily to be followed.
2. Theoretical background
In a recent paper (Glänzel, 2006), an attempt was made to interpret theoretically some properties of the h-index,
given the underlying citation distribution, on the basis of extreme-value statistics. Specifically, the dependence of the
h-index on the basic parameters of the distribution and on the sample size was discussed using Gumbel’s characteristic
extreme values.

Let X be a random variable. In our case, X represents the citation rate of a paper. The probability distribution of X
is denoted by pk = P(X = k) for every k ≥ 0 and the cumulative distribution function is denoted by F(k) = P(X < k). Put
Gk = G(k) := 1 − F(k) = P(X ≥ k). Gumbel’s rth characteristic extreme value (ur ) is then defined as
r

r
ur :=G−1
= max k : G(k) ≥
,
(1)
n
n
where n is a given sample with distribution F. The theoretical h-index (H) can consequently be defined as



r
H:= max{r : ur ≥ r} = max r : max k : G(k) ≥
≥r .
n

(2)

If there exists such index r so that ur = r then we have obviously H := r and we can write H := uH .
Let us consider now an important special case, namely the discrete Paretian distributions with finite expectation.
Most distributions used for modelling publication activity and citation processes belong to this category.
We say, that the distribution of a random variable X is Paretian if it asymptotically obeys Zipf’s law, i.e, if
limk→∞ Gk k−α = constant. Asymptotically Pareto distributed random variables obviously meet this definition since
pk = P(X = k) ≈ d{N + k)−(α+l) if k  1; α > 1, where N and d are positive constants. In what follows we will deal with
this family of distributions. For k  N we obtain pk = P(X = k) ≈ dk−(α+l) and Gk = P(X ≥ k) ≈ d1 k−α , where d1 is a
positive constant. Hence we have,
E(X) =

kpk =

Gk < ∞,

if α > 1.

By elementary manipulation of the cumulative distribution function we obtain the following approximation from the
above definition of Gumbel’s rth characteristic extremes.
 n 1/α
ur ≈ c1

(4)
r
where c1 is a positive constant. Applying the Hirsch condition to this approximation results in the property
 n 1/α
H = uH ≈ c1
, if n  1.

Hence we have
H ≈ c2 n1/(α+1) ,

if n  1,

(6)

α/(α+1)
c1

where c2 =
is a positive constant. In verbal terms, the h-index is approximately proportional to the (α + 1)th
root of the number of publications.
In the case of journals, the question is whether and how the h-index of a journal is determined by the parameters of
its citation distribution (first of all, its expected value: the impact factor) and the “sample size”: the number of papers
published in the corresponding journal.
In case of a two-parameter Pareto distribution with parameters N, α, the expected value (“impact factor”) is
IF =

N
,
α−1

while the constant in Eq. (4) is c1 = N. Hence,
 n 1/α
≈ N α/(α+1) n1/(α+1) .
H = uH ≈ c1

In the special case of α = 2, which corresponds to a Lotka distribution with exponent 3, and is in line with common
assumption in bibliometric models (e.g. Pao, 1986), Eq. (7) results in IF = N, hence we finally obtain
H = cn1/3 IF2/3 ,
where c is a positive real value of order 1.

3. Methods
Journal citation data were collected from the Web of Science (WoS) database of Thomson Scientific. In the present
study, we used one publication year (2001 and 2002) and a 3-year citation window (the year of publication plus the
two succeeding years) to determine both the h-indices and the average citation rate (quasi-impact factor, IF) of the
journals. Four document types: articles, letters, notes and reviews (as coded in the WoS database) were taken into
consideration. For assigning journals to science fields, the classification scheme of Glänzel and Schubert (2003) was
used.
4. Results
Number of publications (n), average citation rates (denoted, by tradition, as IF) and h-indices of 6406 journals in
2001 and 6481 journals in 2002 were determined.
Fig. 1 shows an overall view on the dependence of h on n and IF. On the triple logarithmic scale, the points
representing the journals are apparently lying on a plane. This suggests a power function dependence of h both on n
and IF.
In order to test systematically the validity of Eq. (9), H was plotted against the product n1/3 IF2/3 using data for all
science fields combined, as well as for two science fields: biology and chemistry (according the classification scheme
by Glänzel & Schubert, 2003). Data for two source years, 2001 and 2002 were analyzed. The test led to convincing
positive results (see Figs. 2–4). It was not only proven that H showed a strong linear correlation with the product
n1/3 IF2/3 , but it could also be seen that the value of the constant c was remarkably independent of the science field and
the source year, its value being around 0.75.

5. Conclusions
Studying journal h-indices enabled us to submit a theoretical model of Hirsch-type indices to an empirical test. It
was found that a simple theoretical relation (see Eq. (9)) among H, n and IF, derived from a Paretian model to the
citation distribution within the journals, fits perfectly to the empirical data obtained from one publication year with a
3-year citation window.
Remarkably, the only free parameter of the model, c, proved to be practically independent of the science field. That
means that no specific field dependence of the h-index should be accounted for beyond the well-known field dependence
of publication productivity and citation rate. Eq. (9) in this sense allows for a kind of “similarity transformation” of
h-indices between different fields.
There are a series of open questions waiting for future investigation. Whether Eq. (9) remains valid for other choices
of publication and citation periods, as well, or does the exponent α change with growing time intervals as observed by
Vlachý (1976) and Pao (1986) resulting in different forms of Eqs. (8) and (9)? How the constant c will behave with
changing periods? Whether c will remain constant even in a wider range of science fields?
Hirsch’s h-type indices will certainly challenge scientometrists for a while, and their use in the citation assessment
of journals seems to have promising perspectives with a lot of systematic analysis and statistical background work to
be done.
