Automated Video Analysis of Handwashing Behavior
as a Potential Marker of Cognitive Health
in Older Adults
Ahmed Ashraf and Babak Taati

Abstract—The identification of different stages of cognitive impairment can allow older adults to receive timely care and plan
for the level of caregiving. People with existing diagnosis of cognitive impairment go through episodic phases of dementia requiring
different levels of care at different times. Monitoring the cognitive
status of existing patients is, thus, critical to deciding the level of
care required by older adults. In this paper, we present a system to
assess the cognitive status of older adults by monitoring a common
activity of daily living, namely handwashing. Specifically, we extract features from handwashing trials of participants diagnosed
with different levels of dementia ranging from cognitively intact to
severe cognitive impairment, as assessed by the mini-mental state
exam (MMSE). Based on videos of handwashing trials, we extract
two classes of features: one characterizing the occupancy of different sink regions by the participant, and the other capturing the
path tortuosity of the motion trajectory of participant’s hands. We
perform correlation analysis to assess univariate capacity of individual features to predict MMSE scores. To assess multivariate
performance, we use machine learning methods to train models
that predict the cognitive status (aware, mild, moderate, severe),
as well as the MMSE scores. We present results demonstrating
that features derived from hand washing behavior can be potential
surrogate markers of a person’s dementia, which can be instrumental in developing automated tools for continuously monitoring
the cognitive status of older adults.

I. INTRODUCTION
EMENTIA, including Alzheimer’s disease, is one of the
biggest global public health challenges [1]. As of 2013,
over 35 million people worldwide live with the condition, and
this number is projected to double by 2030 and more than triple
to 135 million by 2050 [1]. Some of the common forms of
dementia include Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia [2], [3].
Usual symptoms of dementia include memory loss, cognitive
impairment, difficulty in communication, and mood changes
among others [1], [2].

Primary care clinicians may not recognize cognitive impairment when using routine history and physical examination [4],
[5] in as many as 76% of patients with dementia [6]–[8]. Most
of these patients are not diagnosed until they are at moderate to
severe stages of the disease [9].
Identification of different stages of cognitive impairment can
potentially allow patients to receive timely care which could in
turn lead to improved quality of life both for older adults and
their caregivers who can better plan informal/formal care in advance. Persons with mild cognitive impairment usually continue
to live at home, while people with moderate impairment start to
need more significant caregiving. As a result, a timely identification of the cognitive status of older adults is of crucial value
to allow them to plan the level of care. Persons with dementia typically exhibit mild symptoms in an inconsistent fashion
when they are going through a phase of mild cognitive impairment [10]. This makes the diagnosis even more challenging as
patients can have normal outcomes in routine exams [4], [5].
Dementia, along with its comorbidities, can adversely affect the
patient’s ability to carry out activities of daily living (ADL), but
the symptoms of the disease may manifest with lesser severity and with inconsistent frequency during early stages of the
disease.
Apart from affecting memory and language functions,
Alzheimer’s disease affects motor planning and hand movement [11], [12]. Specifically, recent studies have noted a correlation between visuomotor impairment affecting eye-hand
coordination in early-stage Alzheimer’s disease [12]. Moreover,
symptoms of apraxia have been reported in patients with senile
dementia of Alzheimer’s type, which become apparent in patients who otherwise demonstrate good language functions [11].
Handwashing is a common ADL performed routinely requiring
both motor planning and eye-hand coordination, and there has
been some evidence that it is affected by cognitive impairment
[13], [14]. In this paper, we investigate if handwashing behavior
can be a potential marker of cognitive disease.
A quantitative representation of the handwashing behavior
may be formulated in multiple ways. To establish a proof-ofconcept we first tested features derived from manually annotated
handwashing trials for predicting cognitive status of the participants. We then explored if automated video analysis could be
used for the same purpose. Specifically, we investigated features
that encode the following aspects of the handwashing behavior:
occupancy of different regions of the sink while completing the
handwashing task, and the path tortuosity of the motion trajectory of the participant’s hands. The latter class of features

is inspired by a recent study which correlates the path tortuosity of walking patterns to the risk of falling in older adults
[15]. As part of this study, we first showed that several of the
above mentioned features have statistically significant correlations with the dementia level as assessed by the mini-mental
state exam (MMSE). We then trained machine learning models
to predict the cognitive state categories based on the MMSE
score (aware, mild, moderate, severe). We also trained regression models to predict the MMSE scores. Our results show that
features encoding the above aspects of handwashing behavior
can be potential predictors of cognitive impairment which can
facilitate in developing tools for automated continuous monitoring of the cognitive status of older adults through a commonly
executed ADL.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section
II, we present a summary of related previous work. Details of
the study population and data collection are given in Section
III. In Section IV, we mention a proof-of-concept study using
manually annotated videos of handwashing. In Section V, we
detail the feature extraction methodology for automated video
analysis of handwashing behavior. Sections VI and VII present
the statistical analysis and results for predicting the MMSE
scores and dementia categories respectively. Finally, in Section
VIII, we present a discussion on our results and interpretation of
top performing features as well as the limitations of the current
study and future directions.
II. PREVIOUS WORK
Smart homes and home automation is increasingly catching
traction that can assist in monitoring the health status of older
adults [16], [17]. Kaye et al. have presented a system that monitors computer usage to assess cognitive impairment of the users
based on their usage patterns [17]. In another study, Dodge
et al. monitored the walking patterns of older adults in their
home setting and suggested that walking variability might be a
predictor of mild cognitive impairment [16]. Handwashing behavior has been studied previously to provide assistance to older
adults while washing their hands. For instance, in a system presented by Hoey et al., hand motion is tracked using a camera
while a person is washing hands, and assistance in the form of
alerts is given to the user [13], [18]. The prompting system in
[18] tracks responsiveness to the prompts, and indirectly estimates the dementia level. Although promising, the study in [18]
remained inconclusive whether the estimated levels of dementia
correlated with the outcome of a standardized test such as the

MMSE score. The focus of our current study is a standalone
and passive monitoring system which can assess the cognitive
health status of older adults that correlates with MMSE scores.
Specifically, we investigate if the level of dementia could be
predicted using hand washing behavior as parameterized by the
following features: statistics of occupancy of different regions
of the sink while handwashing, and the path tortuosity of motion
trajectory of participant’s hands.
III. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Study Population
We used a subset of the data analyzed in the study that investigated the effect of an operator’s familiarity with the faucet
on difficulty of operation [14]. All data was collected, stored,
and analyzed according to a protocol that had research ethics
approval (IRB, University at Buffalo and REB, University of
Toronto). A brief review of the data is as follows. The study
population consisted of 27 older adults (22 female, five male),
age range: 64–100 years (82.4 ± 9.5 years). Each participant
was administered the standardized MMSE exam [19] twice;
once before the beginning, and once after the completion of the
study. The average value of the two scores was taken, although
the variation in the two scores was minimal (correlation between pre- and post-study MMSE scores was 0.98, p < 0.001).
The first MMSE was administered one month before the beginning of the trials. The trials lasted for three months, and the
second MMSE was administered immediately after the completion of the trials. MMSE is a 30 point questionnaire test that
is used to screen for dementia and cognitive impairment. The
exam samples cognitive functions including arithmetic, memory, and orientation [19]. Low to very low MMSE scores have
been reported to be correlated with the presence of dementia
[20]–[22]. Based on the MMSE score, the cognitive impairment
of the test taker can be divided into four categories: severe (≤
9 points), moderate (10–18 points), mild (19–24 points), aware
(≥ 25 points).
B. Hand Washing Trials
Hand washing activity of the study participants was monitored in a designated washroom at a long-term care facility.
The participants of the study were asked to wash their hands
and videos of the sink area were recorded from an overhead
view to enable post-trial analysis. Two researchers were present
for all trials; one researcher acted as the caregiver, and the

other researcher operated study-related equipment. For safety
and study uniformity, the caregiver sat the participant in a
wheelchair at the beginning of each trial. The caregiver positioned the participant at the sink and asked him or her to wash
his or her hands. Each participant was asked to complete about
ten hand washing trials for five faucet types, i.e., crosshead,
dual lever, single lever, electronic, and plastic wand [14]. In all,
1309 trials were conducted. For the purposes of this study, 741
trials that corresponded to commonly occurring faucet types,
i.e., crosshead, dual lever, and single lever, were included.
Patient demographics of our study population with break
down according to MMSE categories, age, and gender is given
in Table I.

IV. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT STUDY
To establish a proof-of-concept, the videos of handwashing
trials were manually annotated as follows. A rater scored the
number and types of errors in each handwashing trial [14]. To
validate data reliability, a second rater scored three randomly selected trials for each participant. Inter-rater agreement between
the primary and secondary raters was examined using Cohen’s
kappa (κ = 0.94). Following features were computed from the
manually annotated data: statistics of time taken to complete the
handwashing task and the number and types of errors. A four
class random forest classifier [23] was trained to predict the
dementia level as aware, mild, moderate, or severe, which gave
a classification accuracy of 61%. Prompted by this moderate
performance of the classifier using manually annotated videos
we explored feature representations which could be extracted
automatically, and could also characterize the handwashing be-

havior with more granularity. We present these features in the
following section.
V. FEATURE EXTRACTION FOR AUTOMATED VIDEO ANALYSIS
For automated video analysis of handwashing behavior we
explored features characterizing the occupancy of different sink
regions by the participant, and path tortuosity of the motion trajectory of participant’s hands. Specifically, each handwashing
trial was represented as a feature vector as follows. First, the
faucet type was encoded as a categorical feature represented
by a set of three binary variables. For instance, if the trial involved a crosshead faucet, it was encoded as [1, 0, 0] etc. The
three binary variables indicating the faucet type are shown as
features 1–3 in Table II. Thereafter, computer vision based features were extracted from each video. This feature extraction is
a multistage process as depicted in the block diagram of Fig. 1.
Given an input video, the region corresponding to a participant’s
hands was identified by skin tone detection for every frame. The
output of skin tone detection was post processed by a morphological opening step to eliminate small noisy specks [24]. We
then computed two types of features described in the following
sections.
A. Sink Occupancy Features
Features included in this type capture the occupancy of various regions of the sink area as the participant performs the
handwashing task. Specifically, we divided a video frame into
subregions as illustrated in Fig. 2. The “Drain” region (shown
in blue) constitutes a region centered around the sink drain.
The “Knob” region (shown in red) consists of two regions

corresponding to the knobs of the cross-head faucet or the two
levers of the dual-lever faucet. There are no knobs/levers in this
region for a single-lever faucet, but we still analyze this region
for a single lever faucet to potentially account for any confusion
a participant might have. The “Nozzle” region (shown in green)
corresponds to the top of the faucet where one would find the
lever for a singer lever faucet. “Sink” region is the area of the
sink which does not correspond to any of the above regions.
And finally, the “Sink” region (shown in yellow) is the union of
all the above regions.
The features that capture the statistics for occupancy of different regions are summarized in Table II. For every region, the
percentage area occupied by the hand per video frame was computed, and the average occupancy percentage for each region
over the entire video was calculated (features 4–8 in Table II).
The time spent in different subregions of the sink was also estimated. To estimate the time, a subregion was declared to be
occupied if occupancy percentage exceeded a threshold (10%).
The number of frames for which a region was deemed occupied
was then divided by the frame rate to get an estimate of the time
spent in each region (features 9–13 in Table II).
B. Path Tortuosity Features
Path tortuosity or variability in movement path, as assessed
by the fractal dimension of the path, has been previously used
to predict the risk of falls in older adults [15]. Motivated by

this study, we investigated if the path tortuosity of hand motion
while washing could be a helpful feature for assessing cognitive
health status.
For computing the path tortuosity, we first detected the tip
of the hand based on the output of hand detection (stage A)
as shown in the block diagram of Fig. 1. For tracking the tip
of the hand, the top-most connected component (as assessed
by the y-coordinate of its centroid) in the output of stage A
was detected. The centroid of the top 10% pixels within this
component was selected as the tip of the hand. It was observed
that the skin detection algorithm was occasionally not perfect,
and as a result did not allow to consistently detect the hand-tip.
To avoid this problem, the motion trajectory was punctuated by
points where the change in the position of the tip exceeded a
threshold, effectively filtering out sudden motions. This step is
carried out in stage D of the block diagram. A sample set of
motion trajectories as detected by stage D are illustrated in the
first row of Fig. 3. As seen in the figure, there are a number of
kinks in the trajectory, which can unnecessarily bias the fractal
dimension of the trajectory toward higher values. As further
processing, the motion trajectories were also punctuated by the
presence of kinks as assessed by a curvature detection algorithm
given in [25]. The outcome of this step is shown in the second
and third rows of Fig. 3. We should note that shorter segments
are predisposed to have smaller fractal dimension. To avoid this
bias toward underestimating the fractal dimension, very short
motion segments in terms of duration (those that lasted less

superimposed on the last video frame corresponding to that trajectory, and the red dot represents the hand-tip (Motion trajectory 1D signifies the first motion
trajectory in the output of step D). Output of stage E: Second and third rows show the output of stage E where the trajectories were punctuated by kinks, and very

than 2 s) were discarded. Starting with the input video, the
output of stage E is a collection of motion trajectories executed
by the participant during the trial. The fractal dimension of
each of these trajectories was computed using the box counting
algorithm [26]. Finally, the statistics of the fractal dimension
were calculated for multiple motion trajectories executed during
a trial as represented by features 14–18 in Table II.
C. Collapsed Features
The features as defined above are extracted from an individual
video trial. In order to explore the variability in these features
over multiple trials, for every participant all trials corresponding
to a particular faucet type were collapsed to a single data point
by computing the statistics (up to second order) of the features
in Table II. Effectively, all the trials for a particular participant
were “collapsed” to three trials, each corresponding to a faucet
type. For simplicity, from here on we would refer to the features
computed at the level of individual videos as “uncollapsed” (see
Table II), and the statistics of uncollapsed features over multiple
video trials as collapsed features. Features computed as part of
the collapsed representation are summarized in Table III.
VI. PREDICTING MMSE SCORES
In this section, we explore if the feature representations described above can predict the MMSE scores of participants. To

analyze univariate performance of individual features, correlations of features with MMSE scores were evaluated, shown
in the last columns of Tables II and III for uncollapsed and
collapsed features respectively. Features with statistically significant correlations (p < 0.05) are indicated by a “*” after their
respective correlations. The last column of Tables II and III
shows the correlation between the respective feature and age.
To assess multivariate performance, a regression model was
trained using leave-one-subject-out cross validation. Instead of
ordinary least squares linear regression, we used regularized
regression based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) [27]. In LASSO regression, the sum of absolute
values of the regression weights is constrained to be less than
a threshold, which prevents regression weights from taking on
very large values, thereby providing robustness against overfitting and inducing sparsity [27]. Specifically, a regression model
was trained using the training set corresponding to the current
leave-one-out fold, and all trials of the left out subject were
tested on this model to give a predicted MMSE score. Pearson’s
correlation coefficient was computed between the predicted and
the actual MMSE score to assess the performance of the model.
Regression models were trained for both the uncollapsed and
collapsed feature representations.
The predicted MMSE scores using the regression model
based on uncollapsed representation had a mild correlation (R =
0.663, p < 0.001), while the model based on collapsed features

VII. PREDICTING DEMENTIA CATEGORIES
While the performance of regression models was promising,
in this section we investigate if the proposed features could
also be used for predicting dementia categories as determined
by MMSE scores. We followed a similar leave-one-subject-out
cross validation scheme as mentioned in the previous section,
but instead of regression, we trained random forest classifiers,
[23], for predicting the dementia categories, i.e., aware, mild,
moderate, and severe. The choice of random forest classifier was
motivated by the fact that it has become a standard data analysis
tool for analyzing high dimensional datasets and give state of
the art performance for a wide variety of applications [28].
Specifically, a leave-one-subject-out cross validation scheme
was employed. For every subject, its examples were left out, and
the remaining were used to train the classification model. This
model was then used to test the unseen examples of the left-out
subject. This process was repeated for all the subjects.The leaveone-out classification results in terms of confusion matrices are
given in Tables IV and V for uncollapsed and collapsed feature
representations, respectively. The overall classification accuracy
of the four-class classifier with uncollapsed features was 52.1%,
while it was 70.4% for collapsed features.
To rank the features according to their relative importance,
the random forest variable importance metric was employed
[23]. Specifically, to measure the importance of a feature, the
values of this feature are permuted among the training data,

and the classification error is again computed on this permuted
data. The importance of the feature is computed by averaging
the difference in error before and after the permutation over
all the trees in the forest. Since we used leave-one-out cross
validation, the average rank of features was computed over all
cross-validation folds. List of features arranged in ascending
order of their rank is given in Table VI.
VIII. DISCUSSION
In this study, we explored if computer vision based features
encoding handwashing behavior of older adults can serve as surrogate predictors of their cognitive health. Our results show that
the above mentioned features have moderate to strong correlation with the MMSE scores, and can also predict the dementia
level as assessed by MMSE score-based categories. The first
observation that stems from our results is that collapsed feature representation outperforms the uncollapsed features both
for regression (Rcollapsed = 0.789 versus Runcollapsed = 0.663)
and classification tasks (accuracy of 70.2% versus 52.1%). This
shows that statistics captured over multiple (∼ 10) handwashing
trials are more representative of cognitive health as compared
to isolated single trials. This is in line with previous findings
that about 76% of dementia patients go undiagnosed in routine
primary care clinic visits [6]–[8], and highlights the importance

median, the edges of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles, the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered outliers, and outliers are plotted

of practical systems capable of monitoring cognitive health on
a frequent basis.
In the confusion matrix of Table V, the classifier gives relatively high accuracies of 77%, 81.5%, and 77% to detect aware,
moderate, and severe categories, respectively, pointing to the
fact that it might be easier to distinguish more extreme categories. All mild cases were misclassified either as aware or
moderate. There were only three participants (out of 27) with
mild impairment in our dataset. As a result, when videos of
a participant with mild dementia were being tested, the leaveone-out model only had two participants to learn from. Poor
performance in detecting mild cases can in part be because of
the underrepresentation of participants with mild impairment in
our dataset and needs to be explored further.
Ranking of different features as shown in Table VI needs
further attention. Box plots of the variation of top ten features
are shown in Fig. 5. To take the effect of multiple comparisons into account, Bonferroni correction was applied to the
p-values. As shown on the plots the p-values remain significant
after applying the correction. Three main patterns emerge from
these box plots. First, more cognitively intact participants tend
to have higher percentage occupancy of different sink regions,
as can be seen in the box plots of the features μ(OccSink ),
μ(OccSink ), and μ(OccDrain ). More interestingly, participants

with moderate and severe level dementia have higher values of
path-tortuosity (assessed by fractal dimension of the motion trajectories) as compared to participants who are cognitively aware
or have mild dementia. This is evident in the box plots for the
following features μ(F Davg ), μ(F Dm ax ), and μ(F DLongest ).
This is consistent with a previous study in which the path tortuosity of walking patterns was indicative of cognitive health
[15]. Further, from the box plots of σ(tDrain ) and σ(tNozzle ), it
can be seen that participants with moderate and severe dementia
have higher standard deviations in the time they spend in different subregions of the sink. This potentially points to the fact
that inconsistent handwashing behavior in older adults might
be representative of different levels of dementia. These findings
are in line with [16], which reports variability in walking speed
to be an indicator of cognitive impairment.
Some limitations of the study must be noted. Since the data
used was initially collected for an earlier study, we did not have
control over the study protocol. To assess the generalizability
of results, future studies will incorporate cognitive tests other
than MMSE scores such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment,
as well as a test for apraxia, and will also control for comorbidities. In the current framework, a participant’s hands are
tracked by a skin-tone detection algorithm, which is not 100%
accurate. In subsequent studies, 3-D depth sensing could be

employed for improved hand detection. Since the dataset was
not specifically collected for detecting early onset of dementia,
participants with mild dementia (based on their MMSE score)
are underrepresented. Future studies will work toward analyzing
a larger population in which the number of participants from all
categories are comparable. One of the aims of this study was to
gain insight into the importance of different features for predicting the cognitive status, and if there are clinical interpretations
for the top ranked features selected by the model. As a result,
all models were trained in the original feature space instead of
going in a latent feature subspace. Although random forest classifiers are well suited to avoid overfitting in high dimensional
features spaces, future studies will explore the effect of dimensionality reduction techniques. Finally, we are working toward
putting together an extended study wherein participants could
be monitored on a long term basis as they undergo cognitive
decline from cognitively intact to various stages of dementia,
which can potentially allow to explore person specific models.
