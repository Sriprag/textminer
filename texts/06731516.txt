A Reconstruction Algorithm of Magnetoacoustic
Tomography With Magnetic Induction for an
Acoustically Inhomogeneous Tissue
Lian Zhou, Shanan Zhu, and Bin He∗ , Fellow, IEEE

Abstract—Magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction (MAT-MI) is a noninvasive electrical conductivity imaging approach that measures ultrasound wave induced by magnetic stimulation, for reconstructing the distribution of electrical impedance
in a biological tissue. Existing reconstruction algorithms for
MAT-MI are based on the assumption that the acoustic properties in the tissue are homogeneous. However, the tissue in most
parts of human body has heterogeneous acoustic properties, which
leads to potential distortion and blurring of small buried objects in
the impedance images. In this study, we proposed a new algorithm
for MAT-MI to image the impedance distribution in tissues with inhomogeneous acoustic speed distributions. With a computer head
model constructed from MR images of a human subject, a series
of numerical simulation experiments were conducted. The present
results indicate that the inhomogeneous acoustic properties of tissues in terms of speed variation can be incorporated in MAT-MI
imaging.

I. INTRODUCTION
MAGING tissue’s electrical properties including conductivity and permittivity have been appreciated in various clinical
applications and continue to attract considerable interests in the
area of biomedical imaging. It has been reported that electrical
properties of a biological tissue are sensitive to physiological
and pathological conditions.
During the past several decades, a number of noninvasive
impedance imaging methods have been developed or under active investigation to estimate the electric conductivity of biological tissues. These include electrical impedance tomography
(EIT) [1]–[4], magnetic induction tomography (MIT) [5] and

magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT)
[6]–[10]. Among these approaches, EIT needs to inject current
into the tissue with multiple surface electrodes. The measurements of surface voltages due to injected current are used to
reconstruct the impedance distribution of biological tissues.
Compared to other tomography methods, EIT has the advantages of low cost, safety, and high speed, but is limited in its
low spatial resolution and the “shielding effect” [11] caused by
low conductive tissue layers. In MIT, an exciting coil is applied
to generate a dynamic magnetic field and induce eddy current
in the tissue. With the detected magnetic field perturbed by
the eddy current, the electromagnetic properties can be reconstructed. This modality addressed the problem of the “shielding
effect” but still faced the limitation of low spatial resolution.
MREIT was developed by combining EIT and magnetic resonance current density imaging which also requires current injection. In MREIT, an MRI scanner is employed to measure
the magnetic flux density induced by injected current. A high
spatial resolution electrical conductivity imaging was suggested
for brain imaging in simulation [7], [8] and achieved in in vivo
experiments [10]. However, the need of high-amplitude current
injection within an MRI scanner currently limits the clinical
applications of MREIT. Besides these electromagnetic imaging
methods, alternative modalities such as magnetoacoustic tomography (MAT) [12], [13] and Hall effect imaging (HEI) [11], [14]
have also been introduced. These two methods benefit with improved spatial resolution, but still suffer from the “shielding
effects” due to the use of surface electrodes for current injection
or surface voltage measurements.
In order to avoid this “shielding effect” and achieve highresolution results, magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic
induction (MAT-MI) [15] was proposed, and investigated [16]–
[26] for imaging electrical impedance of biological tissues with
using ultrasound measurements. In MAT-MI, a sample is located
in a static field and eddy currents are induced in the sample by
a time-varying magnetic field. Acoustic vibration is generated
due to the Lorentz force. MAT-MI utilizes the measurements
of the acoustic pressure around the sample to reconstruct the
conductivity distribution.
In the previous work, several MAT-MI algorithms were developed to reconstruct the distribution of acoustic source without
considering acoustic speed variations in tissue [15]–[25]. However, this assumption is not tenable in some applications, such
as brain imaging, where the acoustic speed variation can be
greater than 100%. In these cases, the reconstruction results
will be deteriorated by blurring and displacement.

In this study, we first use ultrasonic transmission tomography
(UTT) [27]–[29] to quantitatively measure the distribution of an
acoustic speed in the tissue. A new approach is introduced to
reconstruct the distribution of acoustic source and the electrical
impedance is then estimated in a tissue with inhomogeneous
acoustic speed distribution. Numerical simulations, with a human head model, are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness
and performance of the proposed method.

We divided the region of interest (ROI) into n cells as shown
in Fig. 2, and assumed that c(r) in each cell remains constant.
For viewing the angle i, lij is the length of the path that the
acoustic wave transverses though cell j. So, the travel time

II. THEORY
A. Reconstruction of the Acoustic Speed Distribution
In order to solve the acoustic speed distribution problem, we
need to measure the arrival time of ultrasonic wave to calculate
acoustic speed distribution in the tissue. The travel time from
transmitter to transducer can be calculated by (1) along a ray
path [27]–[29]:

1
dl
(1)
T = T (receive) − T (emit) =
c(r)
l(r )
where c(r) is the acoustic speed in the tissue, l(r) is the travel
path of ultrasonic wave, and r is the location. This equation is
not yet in a form that can be solved by the UTT method, as
we also need to measure the flight time T0 of the ultrasonic
wave in homogeneous background. Here, we define travel time
perturbation δT as

 

δT = T − T0 =

l(r )

where cj denotes the acoustic speed in cell j.
Equation (3) meets requirements of the UTT reconstruction
algorithm. By measuring multiple parallel rays across the tissue, and rotating the pairs of transducers, TOF projection data
are formed. Using a filtered back-projection method, the reconstruction of the acoustic speed distribution can be obtained.
B. Effects of Acoustic Speed Variation on MAT-MI
In regions where changes in density are negligible, the wave
equation governing the acoustic pressure in the object is given
as
∇2 p(r, t) −

wherec0 is the acoustic speed in homogeneous background, and
T0 = l(r ) ( c10 )dl.
In UTT transmission mode, two transducers are required, one
to transmit the ultrasonic pulses and the other on the opposite
side of the target to receive them. Fig. 1 shows one possible
arrangement which can be rotated horizontally around the zaxis in a water bath. Measurements on the transmitted pulses
are made at multiple positions with respect to the tissue, and
at multiple angles around it. After measuring the time-of-flight
(TOF), we can reconstruct the image of the speed of sound
distribution within the target using UTT.

where J (r) describes the spatial distribution of the eddy current
density and η(t) describes the shape of the stimulating pulse. In
MAT-MI experiment, we consider only the case that the stimulating pulse is very short η(t) = δ(t) with δ(t) being the Dirac

Here, Pr is the acoustic pressure collected by receivers, Q
is the acoustic source caused by Lorentz force, and Ps is the
acoustic pressure in ROI. The subscript here denotes the size of
the matrix. As we know, Pr is an M × 1 vector. M is the number
of receivers and usually is less than the number of the elements.
The condition that M < N makes the equation underdetermined
and ill-posed. Here, we utilized Tikhonov regularization method
to obtain an appropriately regularized minimum-norm leastsquares solution for the acoustic source Q. If the size of matrix
GM ×N is not too large, we can solve the inverse problem and
compute the result without iteration.
From (8) we know that P can be written as
P = (I − f Gdv)−1 GQ · dv.

(10)

Combining (9) with (10), we have
(8)

Here, N denotes the number of elements in the ROI, Gm n is
Green’s function for cell m and cell n. dv is the volume of each
cell. P is the acoustic pressure and is an N × 1 vector, which
is unknown. In order to derive the vector P , we developed an
iterative method as follows:
1) Step 1: Let P = 0, and assume there is no scattered field
at the beginning;
2) Step 2: Solve (8) in the ROI with the latest P ;
3) Step 3: Compute P(Step=n +1) from step 2, and replace
P(Step=n ) by P(Step=n +1) ;
4) Step 4: If the relative error between P(Step=n ) and
P(Step=n +1) is larger than the given tolerance ε, go back
to step 2. Otherwise finish the procedure and use the
P(Step=n +1) as the final solution.
Also (8) can be used to calculate the acoustic pressure at observation points, with the size of matrix GN ×N and fN GN ×N
reduced to M × N (M denotes the number of observation
points).
C. Inverse Problem
In the inverse problem, the goal is to solve for the vector Q
in (9) which represents the Lorentz force from measurements of
the acoustic field at points outside the scattering region.

Pr = GM ×N Q · dv + f GM ×N ((I − f Gdv)−1 GQ · dv) · dv.
(11)
From (11), we can define the scattering inverse problem as
Pr = AQ

(12)

where AM ×N = GM ×N dv+f GM ×N ((I −f Gdv)−1 Gdv) · dv.
This inverse problem is underdetermined; thus, we use a solution satisfying the minimum-norm least-squares criterion:
Q = AH (AAH )† Pr

(13)

where ()H is the Hermitian transpose, and ()† the pseudoinverse.
In most instances, to maintain a reasonable pixel dimension,
the number of pixels in the ROI must be large enough, and it is
not easy to compute the inverse matrix of G due to the limitation
of computational resources. Here, we propose another iterative
algorithm.
1) Step 1: Let Ps = 0 in (9), and assume there is no acoustic
pressure in ROI at the beginning;
2) Step 2: Solve
H
†
Q = GH
M ×N (GM ×N GM ×N ) (Pr /dv − f GM ×N P )

3) Step 3: Using (14) to compute P(Step=n +1) with P(Step=n )
computed from step 2, and replacingP with the new one;
P(Step=n +1) = GQ · dv + f GP(Step=n ) · dv

(14)

4) Step 4: If the relative error between acoustic source
Q(Step=n ) and Q(Step=n +1) is larger than the given

Using the multiple excitation method of MAT-MI [20], [23],
the distribution of the eddy current can be calculated using

After using multiexcitation algorithm [20] or “Potatopeeling method” [23], we can finally reconstruct the electrical

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATION
We have tested the feasibility of applying the proposed
MAT-MI method for impedance reconstruction on a human head
model, as shown in Fig. 3. The head model was constructed from
MR images of a human subject [32], [33], and contains five tissues: scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, and gray
matter. The parameters of conductivity and sound speed of this
model are listed in Table I. We first used a pair of transmitter
and receiver to reconstruct the acoustic speed distribution. With
different rotation angles, the acoustic speed reconstruction results are shown in Fig. 4. The smaller rotation angle leads to
better acoustic speed estimation. When the rotation angle is 2◦

or smaller, the reconstructed acoustic speed map agrees well
with the target speed distribution.
Also, we have conducted the MAT-MI computer simulation.
The simulated experimental system setup is shown in Fig. 5.
It contains an excitation coil, the head model, and the surrounding water and air media. We meshed the solid models
with tetrahedrons, pentahedrons, and hexahedrons. The tissues
that need high accuracy are meshed with hexahedrons and
the rest are the combinations of tetrahedrons and pentaedrons
with bigger sizes. The reconstructed image has a voxel size of
2 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm.
The focused transducer is used to scan around the object to
collect ultrasound signals, and the horizontal scans at different
vertical locations to get the 3-D multislice volume data.
The 10 mm excitation coil is placed 60 mm above the head
model and its inner and outer radii are 85 and 100 mm, respectively. A current pulse with 5 μs pulse width is injected
into the coil. The current density of the pulse is 3 × 106 A/m2 .
The transducers have a sampling frequency of 5 MHz and are
recorded for 7.5 ms.
We utilized the finite-element method to compute the induced
eddy current in the forward problem of MAT-MI. Each element
is considered as a point source and the center position of the
element is considered as where it is located.

As shown in Fig. 6, the larger amplitude of acoustic source can
be observed in conductivity boundaries such as between white
matter and gray matter. In addition, according to (6), there is
a “secondary acoustic source” existing in the space due to the
acoustic inhomogeneous tissue (f (ri ) = 0).
Fig. 7 shows the distribution of the “acoustic pressure” in the
space. Using the algorithms described in Section II, the results
converged after 10 iterations. As expected, the inhomogeneity
occurs in those tissues whose acoustic properties are different from the background. Compared with the original acoustic
source in Fig. 6, it is blurred in the skull layer due to acoustic
speed variation.
An ideal simulation under noise-free condition and assuming
unlimited bandwidth acoustic measurement is given in Fig. 8.
In this case, the acoustic source results converged after 10 iterations. Compared with the target acoustic source distribution,
relative error (RE) of the entire brain is 4.88%, and in each
slice shown in Fig. 8, RE are 3.75%, 4.52%, 4.83%, 6.31%,

Fig. 12 shows the effects of signal-to-noise ratio to the proposed MAT-MI reconstruction algorithm in an acoustically inhomogeneous tissue.

It is of importance to image electrical properties of biological
tissues and various electrical impedance imaging approaches
have been pursued [1]–[26], [34]–[40]. MAT-MI is a noninvasive impedance imaging approach with high spatial resolution
and does not suffer from the “shielding effect.” The existing reconstruction methods of MAT-MI have been tested only in soft
tissues, which are acoustically homogeneous. However, most
biological tissues contain components with different acoustic
properties. The acoustic speed variation causes both blurring
and displacement in the reconstructed image and reduces the
contrast. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been reported on acoustic source reconstruction with MAT-MI for an
acoustically inhomogeneous tissue.
In our study, we first used the UTT method to reconstruct the
distribution of an acoustic speed in the tissues. UTT [27]–[29] is
a common way to calculate the acoustic properties, and is based
on the assumption that the ultrasound wave travels in a straight
line. In some applications, the assumption may become invalid
when acoustic speed variations are big. In that case, we need to
take special measures to improve the accuracy of acoustic speed
distribution in the tissue. The quality of sound speed imaging
would affect the impedance result directly.
To solve the inverse problem, the conditioned matrix A is
related to the number of observer points. Therefore, a limitation
of the present algorithm is that a large number of measurements
are needed in order to obtain good imaging results. This could be
implemented by using an acoustic transducer array which can be
further rotated on space. Also, with a large number of measurements, the ill-conditioned inverse problem needs to be solved.
Using Tikhonov regularization method, we have tested the performance of this algorithm under different SNR levels as shown
in Fig. 12. Fig. 12 suggests a reasonable image reconstruction could be obtained using the present algorithm considering

ZHOU et al.: RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHM OF MAGNETOACOUSTIC TOMOGRAPHY WITH MAGNETIC INDUCTION

SNR = 60 dB. Further research is needed to improve the inverse
algorithm to obtain enhanced imaging results.
The speed of sound and the acoustic impedance are two important parameters in ultrasound imaging. In the present study,
our imaging method is still based on the assumption ignoring
the density variations, but is able to take acoustic speed variations due to acoustic inhomogeneity of tissues into consideration. When deriving (6), the density variation is ignored, which
would lead to numerical errors around boundaries between the
skull and soft tissue due to substantial change in density. The
effect of the density variations should be further investigated in
future studies.
In addition, we assumed the ultrasound signal is collected by
ideal point detectors in the computer simulation. In practice,
over hundreds of sensing locations can be easily obtained by
mechanically scanning an ultrasound transducer or by using a
transducer array. However, ultrasound transducers with acceptable sensitivity generally have finite aperture size, which may
introduce certain blurring in the reconstructed MAT-MI acoustic source images. The effects of the finite size of transducers
should be taken into consideration in future investigations.
In summary, we have developed a new approach for
MAT-MI to reconstruct electrical impedance in an acoustically
inhomogeneous medium in terms of acoustic speed variation.
This method represents a major advancement in MAT-MI to
consider acoustic speed variation. Computer simulation studies
have been conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance
of this proposed method for mapping electrical conductivity in
the brain. The present results indicate that our proposed method
offers a potential solution to perform MAT-MI high-resolution
imaging in acoustically inhomogeneous tissue, especially for
brain imaging.
