A MDP Model for Breast and Ovarian Cancer
Intervention Strategies for BRCA1/2
Mutation Carriers
Mehrnaz Abdollahian, Student Member, IEEE, and Tapas K. Das, Member, IEEE

Abstract—Purpose: Women with BRCA1/2 mutations have
higher risk for breast and ovarian cancers. Available intervention actions include prophylactic surgeries and breast screening,
which vary significantly in cost, cancer prevention, and in resulting death from other causes. We present a model designed to yield
optimal intervention strategies for mutation carriers between the
ages of 30 and 65 and any prior intervention history. Methods:
A Markov decision process (MDP) model is developed that considers yearly state transitions for the mutation carriers and state
dependent intervention actions. State is defined as a vector comprising mutation type, health states, prior intervention actions, and
age. A discounted value iteration algorithm is used to obtain optimal strategies from the MDP model using both cost and qualityadjusted life years (QALYs) as rewards. Results: The results from
MDP model show that for 30-year-old women with BRCA1 mutation and no prior intervention history, the cost-optimal strategy
is a combination of prophylactic mastectomy (PM) and prophylactic oophorectomy (PO) at age 30 with no screening afterwards.
Whereas, the QALYs-optimal strategy suggests PO at age 30 and
PM at age 50 with screening afterwards. For BRCA2 mutation
carriers at age 30, the cost-optimal strategy is PO at age 30, PM
at age 40, and yearly screening only after age 56. Corresponding
QALYs-optimal strategy is PM at age 40 with screening. Strategies
for all other ages (31 to 65) are obtained and presented. It is also
demonstrated that the cost-optimal strategies offer near maximum
survival rate and near minimum cancer incidence rates by age 70,
when compared to other ad hoc strategies.
Index Terms—BRCA1/2 mutations, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, intervention strategies, Markov decision process

I. INTRODUCTION
T is estimated that more than 300 000 women in the United
States carry BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations. These carriers, who make up 5 to 10% of breast cancer patients, have five
to 20-fold increased risks of developing breast cancer (56% to
85%) and ovarian cancer (16% to 63%) in their lifetimes [1].
BRCA1/2 mutation carriers may choose to undergo prophylactic mastectomy (PM) and/or prophylactic oophorectomy (PO)

to dramatically reduce their risks of breast and ovarian cancers. PM reduces the relative risk of breast cancer in women
to 0.1, whereas PO offers a relative risk of 0.6 of breast cancer
and 0.04 of ovarian cancer [2]. Most recently, Finch et al. [3]
reported that PO also reduces overall risk of death by age 70
by 77%. Since the mutation carriers are considered as high
risk population, organizations such as American Cancer Society
and National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggest annual
screening with mammography and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). MRI offers higher sensitivity in some cases and lower
specificity when compared to mammography [4]. Therefore, enhanced cancer screening beginning at a young age using both
mammography and MRI with the intent of early detection [5]
is considered in this paper. Since the number and type of available drugs for chemoprevention are limited [6] and studies on
medications, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, on reduction
of the incidence of invasive breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers [7] are limited, we did not consider those in our
model.
Mutation carriers and their physicians often struggle with
formulating an effective intervention strategy. Usual dilemmas
include the choice of preventive surgeries, the age at which to undergo a chosen surgery, and whether or not to screen in any given
year [5], [8]. The choice of intervention actions is guided by the
following: increased survival, reduced incidence of breast and
ovarian cancers, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), increased
probability of death from other causes, and the costs and other
undesirable consequences of intervention actions and treatment.
Intervention strategies that include prophylactic oophorectomy are in conflict with the desire of women to have children
at older ages. Bilateral salpingo–oophoroctomy causes early
menopause, increased heart diseases, higher risk of osteoporosis, and for some women, loss of sexuality and gender identity.
Bilateral mastectomy may have a higher psychological impact as
it affects the body image [9]. As shown in [10], annual screening
with mammography and MRI was linked to the longest quality
adjusted survival for women with BRCA1/2 mutation. However, it is expensive and often leads to false positives, thereby
increasing anxiety and costs [11].
Finding a good intervention strategy is difficult as the commonly considered strategies have not been assessed comparatively through randomized trials [5]. Most of the studies in
the literature also do not fully characterized the patient experience. Moreover, breast cancer inflicts a substantial medical and
economic burden to society. Based on the National Cancer Institute report for 2011–2012, $124.6 billion worth of medical care

expenditures were made for cancer care in the United States,
of which female breast cancer accounted for $16.5 billion and
ovarian cancer accounted for $5.1 billion [12]. It was estimated
in the American Cancer Society report for 2012 that 39 510
deaths in the U.S. were due to female breast cancer and 15 500
deaths were due to ovarian cancer [12]. It is estimated that a
cost-effective intervention strategy for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers may save up to $800 million a year in cancer treatment
costs [13].
Open literature offers simulation driven Markov models capable of evaluating given ad hoc strategies with regards to cost
and survival. To our knowledge, a model-based tool to select an
optimal intervention strategy from the set of all possible strategies (strategy space) is not available. Such a model requires
the ability to consider the dynamics of variable action choices
in different health states, their impact on health state transition
probabilities, and their expected costs. Our Markov decision
process (MDP) model, as presented in Section II, attempts to
fill this gap. See [14] for a discussion on MDP models.
A commonly used method for evaluating decision problems
in health care has been “decision tree.” But this method is inapplicable in cases where decisions are state dependent and
influence the state transition probabilities [15]. The framework
of MDP was developed by Bellman (1957), and was extended
by Karlin (1955), Howard (1960), Blackwell (1965), to name a
few [14]. MDP models have been used in recent years in modeling diverse medical decision making problems including organ
transplantation and controlling an epidemic in a closed population [15]. There exist well-known algorithms, such as value
iteration, policy iteration, and linear programming, for finding
optimal policies from MDP models [14], [15].
Our MDP model uses data from recent medical literature
([5] and [11]) on incidence probabilities of various stages of
cancers, utility-weights, availability and cost of interventions,
morbidity, and mortality. The model finds optimal strategies
by either maximizing the total reward measured in terms of
QALYs, or minimizing the total expected cost of intervention
and treatment. Our MDP model is capable of identifying optimal
intervention actions for any state comprising age, health, and
prior intervention status. We considered an expanded and more
realistic state space for identifying health and prior intervention
status of mutation carriers compared to other models in the open
literature. Also in our model, screening option can be turned
on or off at any age, whereas in the published literature, the
screening decision is made only once for all ages.
II. MARKOV DECISION PROCESS MODEL FOR BRCA1/2
MUTATION CARRIERS
We have modeled the yearly state transition process for mutation carriers between ages 30 to 65 as a Markov chain. Subsequently, we have overlayed a decision process model on the
Markov chain to form a MDP model. Solution of the MDP model
yields the optimal intervention strategy comprising actions at
every state. Components of the discrete-time MDP model are
decision epoch, state space, decision space, transition probabilities, and reward function, which are described next.

721

Decision epochs are considered to be the beginning of each
new year starting at age 30 till age 65. We define the state
of a mutation carrier (s) using a three-tuples as s = (a, h, i),
where age a ∈ {30, 31, . . . , 65}, health condition h ∈ {healthy
(hl), breast cancer (bc), ovarian cancer (oc), death from other
causes (de)}, and i indicates the intervention status, which is
explained later. The breast cancer element (bc) of the health condition is represented by a three-tuple as (ER, size, stage) [11],
where ER denotes the estrogen receptor, which can be + or
− size indicates the tumor size given by <2 cm or ≥2 cm,
considered only for the local stage and stage indicates the
clinical diagnosis of the tumor as local (l), regional (r), or
distant (dt). Hence, there are eight possible conditions of the
breast cancer bc element of h, which are {(+, <2, l), (+, ≥2, l),
(−, <2, l), (−, ≥2, l), (+, r), (−, r), (+, dt), (−, dt)}. Ovarian
cancer (oc) element of the health condition h is not further
broken into different stages for modeling purposes. Hence, the
cardinality of health condition is |h| = 11.
The intervention status i of the state of a mutation carrier is
given by a two-tuple (sc, su), where sc indicates the screening status and the su indicates the status of preventive surgery.
Screening alternatives are sc ∈ {N Sc, Sc}, where N Sc is no
screening and Sc is screening with mammography and MRI.
Hence, the cardinality of screening status |sc| = 2. It is considered that the surgeries can be chosen only at ages 30, 40,
or 50, whereas, screening can be chosen at any age. The alternatives for surgery (su) are as follows. For ages 30 up to
39, the surgical status can be su ∈ {no surgery, PM-30, PO-30,
PM+PO-30}, where PM-30 denotes prophylactic mastectomy
at age 30, and the other elements are defined similarly. Between
the ages 40 and 49, we have su ∈ {no surgery, PM-30, PM40, PO-30, PO-40, PM+PO-30, PM+PO-40, PM-30+PO-40,
PM-40+PO-30}. Finally, for ages 50 or greater, the intervention status can be su ∈ {no surgery, PM-30, PM-40, PM-50,
PO-30, PO-40, PO-50, PM+PO-30, PM+PO-40, PM+PO-50,
PM-30+PO-40, PM-40+PO-30, PM-50+PO-30, PM-50+PO40, PM-30+PO-50, PM-40+PO-50}. Hence, for ages between
30 to 39 |su| = 4, between 40 to 49 |su| = 9, and for ages
50 to 65 |su| = 16. Therefore, the cardinality of the state
space S = {s} of a mutation carrier can be given as: |S| =
10 ∗ 11 ∗ 2 ∗ 4 + 10 ∗ 11 ∗ 2 ∗ 9 + 16 ∗ 11 ∗ 2 ∗ 16 = 8492.
The available intervention decisions d are considered to be
state dependent. At ages 30, 40, and 50, the decisions are either
do nothing or conduct surgery and/or screening. At all intermediate ages (31–39, 41–49, and 51–65) intervention decisions
are only either do nothing or start/stop screening. Following are
some examples. In state s1 = (30, hl, NSc, no surgery), the set
of possible decision choices is Ds 1 = {do nothing, Sc, PM, PO,
PM+PO, PM+Sc, PO+Sc, PM+PO+Sc}. In state s2 = (40, hl,
NSc, PM-30), the set of available intervention decisions is Ds 2
= {do nothing, Sc, PO, PO+Sc}. In state s3 = (52, hl, Sc, PM30+PO-40), the set of possible decisions is Ds 3 = {do nothing,
NSc}. In what follows, we characterize the random process that
underlie the changes in the state of a mutation carrier.
Let Xa , a ∈ {30, 31, . . . , 65}, denote the state random variable at age a of a mutation carrier. Define a carrier state
process X = {Xa : a = 30, 31, . . . , 65}. The probability that

model by specifying all possible transitions from a particular
state of a BRCA2 carrier at age 40 when the action of NSc and
PO-40 are chosen. The details of how we obtain the probabilities in Table I are given in Table IX of the supplementary web
material.

a healthy mutation carrier of age a transitions to a particular
state at age a + 1 depends only on her intervention status and
health condition at age a and independent of the past. Hence,
it can be shown that P (Xa+k = u|Xl , ∀l ≤ a; a + k ≤ 65) =
P (Xa+k = u|Xa = v), and thus, X is a Markov chain. Let Da
denote the decision choice random variable, which is a function of the state random variable Xa . Define D = {Da : a =
30, 31, . . . , 65} as the decision process. Then the joint process (X, D) is a MDP. The structure of the one-step transition
probabilities of the Markov chain X is described next.
Fig. 1 shows a small segment of the one-step transition diagram that captures transitions between ages 39–40 and 40–41
under the decisions to do nothing and PM-40, respectively. A
BRCA1/2 mutation carrier who is healthy at age 39 and with
no history of interventions, can transition at age 40 to any of
the health conditions as shown: healthy, breast cancer, ovarian
cancer, death from other causes. If the transition state at age
40 is one of the cancer states, which are considered to be absorbing states in our model, the carrier undergoes treatment. If
the carrier transitions to healthy state at 40 and decides for PM,
the subsequent transitions possible at age 41 are as shown. The
probabilities of various transitions depend on the type of mutation, age, and type of chosen intervention. Note that the effect
of interventions on the transition probabilities also depend on
at what age the intervention was implemented. For example,
transition probabilities between ages 40 and 41 would be different if PM was chosen at age 30 or at age 40. It was found
in [11] that PM at 30 reduces the incidence of breast cancer at
later ages more than PM at 40. This motivated us to supplement
the notation of the interventions with age (for example: PM-30,
PM+PO-50). Table I exemplifies the one-step transitions in our

We used the discounted value iteration algorithm [16] for
solving our MDP model. Let n denote the iteration count, and
Vn (s) denote the value of state s in the nth iteration. It is shown
in (1) how in every iteration the value of the state is updated,
where r(s, d) is the immediate reward of selecting decision d at
state s, α is the discounting factor, and p(j|s, d) is the one-step
transition probability from state s to j under decision d. The
value iteration algorithm consists of the following steps.
Step 1. Set n = 0 and Vn (s) = 0 ∀s ∈ S.
Step 2. For each state, s ∈ S, update the value by using:

p(j|s, d)Vn (j)},
Vn +1 (s) = max {r(s, d) + (1 − α)
d∈D s

j ∈S

∀s ∈ S.

(1)

Step 3. Choose strategy π such that:
π(s) = arg max {r(s, d) + (1 − α)
d∈D s



p(j|s, d)Vn +1 (j)},

j ∈s

∀s ∈ S.

(2)

Set n ← n + 1.
Step 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until ∀s, |Vn +1 (s) − Vn (s)| < θ,
where θ is the chosen threshold value for convergence.
Step 5. Return π as the optimal strategy.
Two main input parameters needed in the implementation
of the discounted value iteration algorithm are the one-step
transition probabilities (p(j|s, d)) and the immediate rewards
(r(s, d)). In the following subsections, we provide details of
how these input parameters are obtained.
A. Computation of One-Step Transition Probabilities
We computed the one-step transition probabilities using the
breast and ovarian cancer incidences at specific ages of 30,
40, till 80 (as given in [5]). Since our model considers yearly
transitions, we used linear interpolation (as done in [17]) to obtain transition probabilities for intermediate ages. As far as the
surgical interventions are concerned, we chose to consider them

ABDOLLAHIAN AND DAS: MDP MODEL FOR BREAST AND OVARIAN CANCER INTERVENTION STRATEGIES

only at ages 30, 40, and 50 (similar to [11]). However, the transition probabilities resulting from the surgical interventions that
we adopt from [5] are for ages 25, 40, and 50. We used the transition probabilities resulting from surgical interventions at 30
same as that for 25 in [5]. Transition probabilities from healthy
(hl) to death from other causes (de) are calculated using Berkeley mortality database [18]. The mortality rates are reduced by
the rates of death caused by breast and ovarian cancers and then
further adjusted for the side effects of PO using [11], [18], [19].
Since undergoing PO before age 50 has a two-fold increased
risk of cardiovascular disease and a 50% increased risk of osteoporotic hip fracture and dementia, we adjusted the probabilities
of death from other causes based on these relative risks [11]. For
finding the transition probabilities from a healthy state to a breast
cancer state, we used stage and estrogen receptor (ER) proportions from [17]. The probability of transition to the healthy
state is found by subtracting from one the total probabilities
of transition to other states. When surgeries are implemented
at different ages, for example, PM-30 and PO-50, we assumed
that the transition probabilities after PO-50 to be the same as
PM+PO-30.
We considered that the decision to start or stop screening
can be made at any age between ages 30 and 65. Transition
probabilities resulting from the screening decision were adopted
from [5].
B. Reward: Immediate Cost of Intervention
and Treatment Decisions
We considered three types of decisions involving cost:
surgery, screening, and cancer treatment. We also considered
the cost of death from other causes, which considers only the
terminal care cost. Costs of surgeries and screening are assumed
to be state independent and their values are adopted from [13]
and [21]. For example, cost of PO is considered to be same
irrespective of the age it is performed. Cost of cancer treatment
in a given stage depends on direct and indirect costs, probability
of cancer recurrence, and terminal care cost.
As in [11], we used a stage-based classification. Stage I is
defined as local and tumor size less than 2 cm. Stage II is defined
as local with tumor size greater than or equal to 2 and some of
regional cases. Some of the more advanced regional cases are
classified as Stage III. Distant cases are considered stage IV.
Since the regional cases can be classified either as Stage II or
III, we take the average of the costs as the cost of treatment for
regional cases. The cost Cbk of treating breast cancer in stage
k ∈ {I, II, III, IV } is obtained as
Cbk = [Cgk + Cdk + Cek + Cfk ] ∗ (1 + pk1 ) + pk2 ∗ Ct

(3)

where the cost of diagnosis of cancer Cgk , includes mammography, diagnostic following initial MRI, and the subsequent follow
up MRI, Cdk is the direct cost of treatment, Cek is the indirect
cost of lost income during treatment, Cfk is the cost of follow-up,
and Ct is the terminal care cost of the last year of having breast
cancer. The probability of recurrence in the next five years, denoted by pk1 , is obtained from [11], [22], and the probability of
death from breast cancer in the next five years, pk2 , is obtained

723

TABLE II
UTILITY (FOR QALYS) AND COST VALUES

from [21], [23]. Representative values of these costs are adopted
from [13] and [21], which are then adjusted for inflation from
2004 to 2013. The calculated costs are shown in Table II.
For stages I and II, we considered that the patients will undergo lumpectomy with axillary dissection, radiotherapy, and
endocrine therapy (only for everyone in two patients) as recommended in [24]. Based on [21], we assumed a 12 week long
work discontinuity for stages I and II. Stage III and IV treatment
considers mastectomy and adjuvant therapy (depending on estrogen receptor (ER) status) [21]. Before age 50, it is estimated
that 40% of patients will use bilateral mastectomy and 60%
will undergo unilateral mastectomy. After age 50, we consider
a 50% chance that patients will choose one of the options [21].
Hence, we used the average cost of unilateral and bilateral
mastectomies.
The cost of treatment for ovarian cancer C o is obtained as
C o = [Cdo + Ceo ] + po2 ∗ Cto
where Cdo and Ceo are the direct and indirect cost of treating
ovarian cancer, respectively. po2 is probability of death from
ovarian cancer in the next five years, and Cto is the terminal care
cost. All these costs were obtained from [13], [21] and [25] and
further adjusted for inflation at rate 3%.
C. Reward: Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)
We also used QALYs as our reward function. Table II provides
the mean utility weights (also referred to in the literature as
preference rating) that are used to define the relative value of
each disease state. In order to find QALYs for a year of life,
one can multiply the utility value of a given state by 1. The
utility weights are obtained using time-tradeoff rating and other
similar methods discussed in [13] and [20]. Since our decision
epochs are at the beginning of each year, the incremental utility
of the MDP at each step is considered to be QALY [26]. QALYsoptimal policy maximizes the QALYs for a mutation carrier with
no concern for cost.
IV. RESULTS
We solved the MDP model using the value iteration package
available in MATLAB [27] using an Intel dual core with 16 GB
RAM. We used a 3% discount factor based on an assumed rate

ALL POSSIBLE INTERVENTION STRATEGIES FOR 30 YEAR OLD BRCA1
MUTATION CARRIERS WITH NO PRIOR INTERVENTION

of inflation. The computation time was approximately 20 min.
We first solved the model using cost as our reward function. For
BRCA1 mutation carriers, Table VI presents the cost-optimal
intervention strategies for ages 30 to 65 (rows) and all possible
prior intervention history (columns). For example, for a BRCA1
mutation carrier who has undergone PO at age 30, at age 40,
PM-40 is recommended as the optimal intervention. Note that,
we assumed that all surgical interventions occur at the beginning
of the year. Following a surgery, either a screening (Sc) or no
screening (NSc) action is chosen for the rest of the year. Therefore, for the aforementioned scenario, at the beginning of age 40,
her prior intervention history changes to PO-30+PM-40. Referring to column PO-30+PM-40, no screening is recommended
from 40 to 50, and then yearly screening is recommended for
ages 51–65.
For a 30 year old BRCA1 mutation carrier with no prior
intervention history, the optimal action is to undergo both PM
and PO at age 30 (see row ‘30’ and column ‘none’). Now,
referring to age 30 and column PM+PO-30, no screening is
recommended until age 65.
The cost-optimal intervention strategies for BRCA2 mutation
carriers can be found in Table VIII in the supplementary web
material. The optimal strategy for a 30 year old with no prior
intervention is to undergo PO at age 30. This changes the prior
intervention history to column PO-30, which recommends no
screening between ages 30–39. At age 40, PM is recommended,
which modifies the prior intervention history to PO-30+PM-40.
Per this column, no screening is recommended during ages 40–
56, followed by yearly screening till 65. If intervention actions

TABLE IV

STRATEGIES FROM DIFFERENT MODELS FOR A BRCA1 MUTATION ZCARRIER

are limited to only one surgery at a time, our model recommends
PO at age 30 and PM at age 40 for both mutation carriers.
A recent large international prospective study [3] suggests
that BRCA1 mutation carriers should undergo prophylactic
oophorectomy by age 35 because of the high risk of getting
ovarian cancer. This survival-based study also recommends that
BRCA2 mutation carriers can wait until age 40 safely because
of the lower risk of ovarian cancer. Given this recommendation and the fact that most women are not willing to undergo
PO during child bearing ages, we examined a scenario via our
cost-based model where PO is not considered before age 40 for
BRCA2 mutation carriers. Our model suggests PM at age 30
and PO at age 50. Even when a BRCA2 mutation carrier delays
PM to age 40, our model still recommends PO at age 50.
We then solved the MDP model using the QALYs as our
reward function. As opposed to the cost-optimal solution that
chooses both surgeries at the same time, QALYs-optimal model
postpones PM to age 50 for BRCA1 and does not recommend
PO at age 30 for BRCA2 mutation carriers. The optimal intervention strategies for a BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carrier
can be found in Table V and VII. For a 30 year old BRCA1 mutation carrier with no prior intervention, our model suggests PO
at age 30 following by PM at age 50. The model recommends
yearly screening starting from age 50. For a 30 year old BRCA2
mutation carrier with no prior intervention, the QALYs-model
recommends PM-40 and yearly screening only after age 40.
V. ASSESSMENT AND COMPARISON OF OPTIMAL
INTERVENTION STRATEGIES
We used an online tool in [28] to assess probabilities of health
outcomes by age 70 for several optimal intervention strategies
derived from the MDP model, and compared those with outcome probabilities from all the other possible (but nonoptimal)
intervention strategies. The outcomes by age 70 are death from
other causes, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and healthy. We
constructed a set of intervention strategies for BRCA1 mutation
carriers of ages 30, which are shown in Table III. Note that
the outcome assessment tool [28] does not allow consideration
of partial screening strategies. Hence, for MDP recommended
strategies that require partial screening, we have considered their
fixed screening variants for comparison purposes.

TABLE V
QALYS-OPTIMAL INTERVENTION STRATEGIES FOR BRCA1 MUTATION
CARRIERS OF AGES 30 TO 65

For all strategies in Table III, we obtained health outcome
probabilities by age 70. These are plotted in Fig. 2, for BRCA1
mutation carriers. It may also be noted that the assessment tool
[28] does not allow PO before age 35. Since our model considers
PO starting at age 30, we assumed that the outcome probabilities
of PO-30 are approximated by those of PO-35.
As shown in Fig. 2, the optimal intervention strategy #7
[marked by the vertical line (1)] has the highest probability
of being healthy by age 70 (0.72) and the lowest probability of
incidence of breast cancer (0.05). It also has a low probability
of ovarian cancer (0.07), which is within 1% of the lowest obtained by other strategies, for example, #4 and #5. The optimal
strategy #7 has 16% risk of death from other causes compared
to, for example, 10% for strategy #2. This increase is very much
expected as it is well known that PO increases probability of
death from other causes. The QALYs-optimal strategy #16 has
a probability of 0.59 for being healthy by age 70 and a probability of 0.08 for ovarian cancer incidence. This strategy also
has a low probability (0.13) of death from other causes which
compares well with the lowest value of 0.1 offered by strategy
#2. The QALYs-optimal strategy has 0.2 probability of breast
cancer incidence compared to 0.05 for the cost-optimal strategy
(#7). Health outcome results for BRCA2 mutation carriers can
be found in Table XI and Fig. 3 provided in supplementary web
material section.
VI. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
While examining the effect of normal variations in intervention cost on the cost-optimal strategies, no deviations were

725

TABLE VI
COST-OPTIMAL INTERVENTION STRATEGIES FOR BRCA1 MUTATION CARRIERS
OF AGES 30 TO 65

observed. Only when we increased the intervention cost by five
folds for BRCA1 and ten folds for BRCA2, the optimal strategy for a 50 year old BRCA1/2 mutation carrier changed from
PM+PO-50 to PO-50. When the cost increases approached 20
folds, the optimal strategies for both 40 and 50 year olds changed
to screening only. Hence, the strategies derived from the MDP
model are quite robust to cost estimate variations. When we decreased the utility weights by one standard deviation for BRCA1
mutation carriers, PO-30+PM-40 changed to PM+PO-30 with
less frequent screening. For BRCA2 no changes in surgery options were observed with decreased utility. But when we increased the utility weights, lower screening frequencies were
recommended. We conducted a sensitivity analysis for the discount factor in the range of 1%–5%. No significant variations
in the results were observed.
VII. DISCUSSION
We extended the Markov chain model presented in [13] to
a Markov decision model (MDP) by first considering an expanded state space and then by superimposing a state dependent decision process on the Markov chain. The expanded state
space for health and treatment status of mutation carriers and
the corresponding intervention decision options were developed
using information available in [11]. The solution of our MDP
model yields cost and QALYs-optimal intervention strategies
for healthy BRCA1/2 mutation carriers of age 30 to 65 and
with all possible prior intervention status. In our model, the
screening decision choice is considered each year as opposed to
a one-time decision made at age 25 (as in [11]) or age 35 (as
in [13]). In [13], Markov modeling with Monte Carlo simulation

was implemented to find the cost-effective strategies for 35 to
50 year old BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. In [11], a Monte carlo
model simulated life histories of a 1980 birth cohort of 1 000 000
female with BRCA1/2 mutations from age 25 until age 100 or
death.
In our MDP model, we first used expected present cost to
find cost-optimal intervention strategies. True cost of intervention actions, treatment, and the intervention depended transition
probabilities from healthy to other states play important roles
in yielding the optimal intervention strategies. Since treatment
costs are significantly higher than the prevention costs for breast
and ovarian cancers, the model attempts to prevent the incidence
of cancer while also trying to minimize the cost of intervention
decisions. We then used utility weights (that represents the quality adjusted value of a year of life) to find the QALYs-optimal
strategies. For this, the model attempts to maximize QALYs for
a person with any prior intervention history and any age. The
existing simulation based models [11] and [13] are capable of
evaluating a given strategy. Whereas, our MDP model can be

solved optimally to yield intervention strategies comprising optimal decisions for every state of a healthy mutation carrier. For
example, our model has 8492 states and each state has between
1 and 8 possible state dependent decision choices. The value iteration algorithm is able to identify the optimal decision choice
for each state. Also, as demonstrated through the use of both
cost and QALYs metrics of performance, the MDP model can
accommodate a variety of reward measures, for which optimal
strategies could vary. Another feature of our model is that it is
possible to have an optimal strategy with partial screening. This
is an improvement over strategies with fixed screening only that
were presented earlier to the literature.
We compared our MDP model with models in [11] and [13]
using the health outcome probabilities obtained by the online
tool in [28]. As shown in Table IV for a BRCA1 mutation
carrier, the MDP cost-optimal intervention strategy, when compared to [11], yields the same probabilities of being healthy
(0.72), lower ovarian cancer incidence (0.07), and a slightly
higher probability of breast cancer incidence (0.05) and death
from other causes (0.16). The MDP cost-optimal strategy has
better health outcomes compared to [13] in almost all categories
(see Table IV). The MDP QALYs-optimal intervention strategies yields the lowest probability of death from other causes
and slightly higher probability of cancer outcomes compared to
the other models. A similar comparison for BRCA2 mutation
carriers can be found in supplementary web material in Table X.
According to the National Cancer Institute website [29], availability of data on the outcomes of interventions to reduce breast
and ovarian risks in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers is limited.
There exists uncertainties regarding cancer risk associated with
BRCA1/2 mutations [29]. Therefore, management of interventions are done primarily based on expert opinions. We believe
that development of model-based decision tools, as presented
here, can help both policy makers as well as patients to make
more informed intervention decisions. Our model suffers from
the following limitations. Since the one-step transition probabilities were adopted from [11], the definition of state vector
in our model for a mutation carrier had to be restricted. For
example, we could not consider various stages of ovarian cancer and recurrence of breast cancer, as this would require more
granular data, than what is currently available, to generate the
necessary one-step transition probabilities. Our model considers
surgical interventions (PM and PO) only at ages 30, 40, and 50.
Once again, limited availability of one-step transition probability data restricted our consideration of surgical interventions in
the intermediate ages.
