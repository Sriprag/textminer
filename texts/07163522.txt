Abstract—Goal: Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease which is very
common in the population and requires frequent clinical and pharmacological treatment. In the following, a study based on Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy analyzing saliva proteomic components in psoriatic patients against diabetic patients and a control
group is presented. Clinical analysis showed a prominent amide II
band, at around 1545 cm−1 , and the composition of the amide I
band, at around 1647 cm−1 , allowing us to distinguish the infrared
salivary signature of psoriatic and diabetic patients from the control group and even from patients with different kinds of psoriasis.
Moreover, results highlighted existing differences in the secondary
structure composition of proteins between psoriatic and diabetic
patients as compared to the control group. In fact, the saliva spectra of the control group and that of the palmoplantar psoriatic
patients differ from plaque psoriasis and diabetic patient spectra
because of the absence of the amide II band and the presence of
different secondary protein-structure conformations.
Index Terms—Clinical diagnosis, curve fitting, diabetes, infrared
spectra, noninvasive treatment, saliva analysis, spectral analysis.

I. INTRODUCTION
SORIASIS is a chronic skin disease very common in the
population of North America and Europe, with a prevalence ranging from 2.2% to 6.5% [1], [2]. Due to its widespread
occurrence and its chronic nature, psoriasis patients frequently
need to be checked and treatment adjustments made. In clinical
studies, the use of noninvasive methods such as saliva analysis,
may represent a very practical diagnostic and follow-up tool
for the treatment of psoriatic patients. In the last few decades,
saliva has been in use for the detection of various pathological
conditions as well as for physiological and genetic alterations.
Salivary analysis has demonstrated its importance in the diagnosis of endocrine and hereditary disorders, and autoimmune,
malignant and infectious diseases. It is also useful in patient
follow-up and for monitoring the use and abuse of drugs [3]–
[5]. The use of saliva for diagnostic applications offers several
advantages over other biological human fluids such as serum
because it contains the same constituents as serum, but is a noninvasive, easy, low-cost approach for screening [6], [7]. It is an
exocrine body fluid which is 98% water and 2% complex mix-

ture of proteins, peptides, and other substances including hormones and amino acids [8]–[10]. Recent research has suggested
that salivary biomarkers such as glucose, immunoglobulins, and
glycated end-products exhibit a strong diagnostic potential specific for diabetes and other diseases such as physiological stress,
salivary calculi, and oral pathologies such as carcinoma and periodontitis [11]–[16]. Among the techniques available for saliva
analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is very
useful and is a noninvasive tool which allows the acquisition
of qualitative and quantitative information about the molecular
structure and the nature of the chemical bonds present in biological fluids [17], [18]. We started investigating biological fluids
signature in for the development of silicon-integrated nanosensors to directly convert bioenergy into electrical energy through
the adsorption of biomolecules, such as urea, the salivary level
of which is of clinical importance [19], [20]. In this study, a technique based on FTIR-ATR (attenuated total reflection mode) has
been investigated for a comparative analysis between psoriatic
patients, diabetic patients, and a control group with the aim of
finding characteristic infrared salivary signatures [21]–[25].
Results presented showed characteristic features between
plaque- and palmoplantar psoriasis and diabetes in the presence of the amide II band. Postprocessing of infrared salivary
spectra based on the curve-fitting procedure carried out on the
deconvolved amide I band, showed significant differences in the
secondary structure composition of proteins between psoriatic
and diabetic patients, when compared with healthy subjects.
Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) performed on
sample spectra showed promising results toward the possibility
of using an unsupervised classification method as a diagnostic
tool for anonymous saliva samples.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Study Population
This study was carried out on patients presenting to the Operative Unit of Dermatology, Department of Health Sciences,
University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Italy, between March
1st, 2014 and September 1st, 2014. After signing the informed
consent release, as approved by the local ethics committee of
the same University, 35 patients with different kind of psoriasis,
20 patients with diabetes, and 20 healthy patients were enrolled.
The study population and the control group were both analyzed according to the patients’ demographic determinations:
age, gender, and body mass index (BMI), while the psoriasis
sufferers were also investigated as to disease history and possible association with other disorders or habits. During the first

approach is particularly suitable for measuring substances displaying strong infrared absorption such as water, or water-based
biological samples such as saliva [21].
The spectra are obtained in the wave number range between
4000 and 650 cm−1 with a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1 . For
each patient, 5 μL of saliva was placed by pipette onto an ATR
germanium prism and 100 scans were made, using a signal
acquired without sample as background. This procedure was
repeated three times for each sample.

Variables are expressed as median and standard deviation.

visit, all the patients were subjected to anthropometric evaluation and saliva collection. The severity of the disease was
assessed by calculating the psoriasis area severity index (PASI)
which ranged from 0 to 72.
Of the 35 psoriasis patients, 20 were men (57.1%) and 15
were women (42.9%) with an average age of 54 ± 16 years and
an average BMI equal to 25.8 ± 4.8 kg/m2 . Ongoing pharmacological treatment or intercurrent diseases existing during the
study were considered the cause for exclusion. The psoriatic
patients had an average disease duration of 14 ± 8 years. In
addition, among the psoriatic patients, vulgar and/or pustular
psoriasis showed up in 25 subjects (71.4%) and palmoplantar
psoriasis in 10 subjects (28.6%). The average PASI score was
found to be 8.8 ± 6.3. The 20 diabetic patients enrolled were ten
male and ten female with an average age of 55 ± 17 years. The
20 healthy patients (ten men and ten women), had an average
age of 49 ± 18 years, with an average BMI of 24.5 ± 1.4 kg/m2
at the time of the enrollment, comparable to that of the study
group (see Table I).
B. Saliva Collection
All of the subjects involved in the study gave saliva samples.
Samples were collected in the morning before eating, by expectoration into a sterile polypropylene tube box prior to infrared
spectrometer analysis. Patients were requested not to drink (except for water), not to smoke, not to use steroid lotions or creams
or chew gum, the night before saliva sampling. Twenty diabetic
patients were used as the comparison group following the same
criteria and procedure for saliva collection. Based on the questionnaire the participants filled out, saliva samples collected
from the control group were obtained from healthy nonsmokers with no evidence of associated diseases. No adverse effects
associated with saliva sampling were reported.
C. Infrared Saliva Spectroscopy
Saliva samples were analyzed by an infrared spectrometer
(NICOLET 6700, Thermo-Scientific) equipped with a Smart
iTR attenuated total reflectance (ATR) sampling accessory. Using ATR, the internal reflection of light generates an evanescent
wave that penetrates the sample to a depth of 0.5–2 μm, depending on the wavelength of the light, the angle of incidence, and the
indices of refraction of the ATR crystal, but independent from
sample thickness [22]. ATR crystal is made of a high refractive index material, Germanium in our case. Consequently, this

D. Data Analysis and Processing
The saliva spectra were postprocessed using Omnic Spectra
Software (Thermo Scientific), baselined and then smoothed at
7 points involving the digital removal of the noise (rapid amplitude variations) while retaining the characteristic features of the
signal (smooth amplitude variations) as shown in Fig. 1. PCA is
considered a valuable technique for determining relationships
among samples. PCA can be applied as an ATR-FTIR postprocessing technique both for denoising and as an unsupervised
feature extraction tool [25].
In this study, a series of 75 independent saliva sample spectra
were analyzed and split into four groups. In this way, each group
contained spectra of each considered subpopulation in order to
assess the PCA discriminating ability of the IR spectra. The
first group was related to a healthy population while the remaining three groups were correspondent to the considered pathological conditions (diabetic patients, plaque-, and palmplantar
psoriasis patients). PCA was performed and outlier samples
were removed from among the set of compared data by way of
Hotelling’s T-squared test. In addition, the selection of the relevant number of principal components (PCs) that allow proper
reconstruction of the original data was taken into account. Postprocessing is important for analyzing the secondary structure
of proteins. In saliva spectra, the secondary structure bands are
overlapped by vibrations of the amide bands in H2 O with consequential shading of the zone that separates the maxima of adjacent peaks. It is therefore necessary to postprocess the spectra
in order to extract the individual bands corresponding to the secondary structure of the protein [26]. Fourier self-deconvolution
(FSD) enhances the resolution of spectra, focusing the analysis around the wave numbers of interest and then separating
the secondary structure bands from adjacent bands. The quality of the deconvolved bands is determined using the full-width
at half height (FWHH) factor and the resolution enhancement
factor: the first is indicative of the widths of the overlapping
bands while resolution enhancement is the measure of the degree of band separation, determining the number and the maximum of the function subcomponents [28]. During experimental
analysis, saliva infrared spectra was deconvolved using a Gaussian line shape together with a resolution enhancement factor
of 2.4 and a bandwidth of 13 cm−1 . After carrying out FSD
on amide I band [see Fig. 2(a)], the quantitative contribution
of each amide subcomponent was evaluated through curve fitting by an iterative adjustment of band height, width, and position. The curve-fitting procedure gave a good estimation of the

percentage of each individual secondary structure of the examined proteins [28].
E. Statistical Analysis
All the variables taken into account during the study were
tested for normality distribution by using the Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test and considered as continuous values expressed as
mean and standard deviation (SD). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov

test (K–S test) determines whether two probability distributions
differ, or whether a probability distribution differs from a hypothesized distribution [29]. Moreover, a statistically significant
level of P < 0.005 was set. Statistical differences of secondary
protein structures were evaluated through Student’s T test (comparison of two groups) for independent samples and through
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for intergroup differences of secondary protein structures. Analyses were performed
using the IBM-SPSS v20.0 statistical package.

III. RESULTS
All the enrolled patients affected by plaque psoriasis showed
characteristic features on the IR spectrum. In fact, analysis of
their saliva samples revealed three strong adsorption bands:
the first band was centered at 3316 ± 41 cm−1 , the second at
1647 ± 3 cm−1 , and the third at 1543 ± 3 cm−1 (see Fig. 1(a)].
The palmoplantar psoriasis patients showed a different spectrum
with only two adsorption bands, respectively, at 3324 ± 8 and
1639 ± 1 cm−1 [see Fig. 1(b)]. Similar to the spectra of the palmoplantar psoriasis patients, the control group spectra showed
two strong adsorption infrared peaks centered at 3372 ± 5 and
1641 ± 2 cm−1 , respectively, [see Fig. 1(d)]. Moreover, as highlighted in Fig. 1(c), the IR spectra of patients with diabetes
revealed similarities to those of plaque psoriasis sufferers and
differed from both the palmoplantar and control group spectra, showing characteristic peaks at 3331 ± 34, 1645 ± 2, and
1545 ± 2 cm−1 .
According to the literature, the adsorption band between
3600 ÷ 3000 cm−1 arises from the aqueous component of saliva,
the band between 1717 ÷ 1600 cm−1 is related to the C = O
stretching vibration of the amide I band, and the band peculiar to
the plaque psoriasis patients between 1600 ÷ 1500 cm−1 represents the N-H bending vibration coupled with the C-N stretching
of the amide II band [32]. The spectra of the plaque psoriasis
patients showed an amide I band similar for all the analyzed
groups, while the amide II band was only present in the plaque
psoriasis and diabetic patient’s spectra. The amide II band arises
mainly from in-plane N-H bending and C-N stretching vibrations, with small contributions coming from CO-, CC-, and
NC-bond vibrations of different molecules, including α-helix
and β-sheet molecules. Contrarily, the amide I band consists of
approximately 80% C = O stretch vibrations arising from peptide linkage and 20% from the in-plane bending vibration of the
N-H bond, plus a small contribution coming from the out-ofphase CN stretching mode and CCN deformation [27], [31]. The
amide I band is composed of different overlapping bands representing secondary protein structures. In order to qualitatively
identify the different secondary protein structures, the Fourier
deconvolution procedure was applied to the amide I band. Consequently, the deconvolution of the infrared spectra of amide I
in all the analyzed saliva samples showed bands representing
secondary protein structures. Among all the evidenced bands,
three of them were analyzed at around 1630 ± 3, 1645 ± 2,
and 1654 ± 3 cm−1 which refer, respectively, to β-sheets, random coils, and α-helixes [32] [see Fig. 2(a)]. Considering the
theory that proteins expressed by the amide I band are characterized by a linear sum of the fundamental secondary structures
of each protein, we performed curve fitting to quantitatively
estimate the contribution of each secondary structure of these
three component bands. The secondary protein structures can
be distinguished by their hydrogen bonding pattern because of
the different amide bond vibration frequencies. In fact, conformational changes were monitored through the detection of alterations in frequency and the intensity of the overlapped bands.
This high degree of sensitivity of the amide bands to small variations in molecular geometry allows us to detect conformational
changes in the protein structures [33]. Fig. 2(b)–(d) shows the

curve fitting of the deconvolved spectra observed respectively
in the saliva of plaque psoriasis patients, in the saliva of control
group patients, and in the saliva of diabetic patients, which represent the secondary structures of β-sheets, random coils, and
the α-helix. Data concerning the three secondary structures are
reported in Table II. ANOVA one-way analysis showed a statistically significant difference between the secondary structure
peak heights among all the considered groups (see Table II).
A comparison between T-testing carried out on plaque psoriasis and control group patient’s samples highlights an increased
expression of all the secondary protein structures and the same
result was obtained using the same test performed on the samples from the diabetic patients and the control group. Moreover,
it was observed that secondary protein structure expression in
patients with plaque psoriasis and diabetes are almost identical. T-testing performed on plaque and palmoplantar psoriasis
patients showed statistically significant differences in α-helixes
(P < 0.026) and random coils (P < 0.049), but there was no
significant difference in the β-sheets. Fig. 3(a)–(c) shows the
distribution of secondary structure peak heights in patients affected by plaque psoriasis as compared to those in the control
group.
These findings of the presence of a pronounced amide II band
and the conformational changes in the amide I band observed
in the saliva of patients with plaque psoriasis are very similar
to the ones found both in the saliva and in the nails of patients
with diabetes [34], [35].
PCA analysis was performed on the 1700–1500 cm−1 band,
after choosing a model of seven PCs and a correspondent explained variance of 99.99%. The score plot of PC6 versus PC1
which displays information about the sample in the PCA model
projecting spectrum data information onto the PCs is shown in
Fig. 4(b).
As shown in Fig. 4(a), healthy subjects identified with a blue
square are localized in the third quadrant while palmoplantar
psoriasis patients are enclosed in a small area between healthy
subjects and plaque-psoriasis patients (second quadrant). Diabetic patients are spread out over the first and fourth quadrants.
Finally, analysis done on baselined and smoothed spectra and
compared with those without showed no noticeable differences
in the statistical or in the PCA analysis.
IV. DISCUSSION
The IR saliva spectra of patients suffering plaque psoriasis
present characteristic features for amide II (absent in all the
control group spectra) and a particular band composition for

amide I. These spectra were very different from both those of
the control group and patients with palmoplantar psoriasis and
similar to diabetic patients [see Fig. 3(d)]. ATR-FTIR analysis
of nails and saliva in patients affected with diabetes evidenced
the presence of a prominent amide II band and a singular composition of the amide I band. Therefore, our data suggest that
there is a particular alteration of the proteins in the saliva of patients with plaque psoriasis which is very similar to that found in
patients with diabetes. Consequently, our observations go in the
same direction as the hypothesis that there is a strict linkage between psoriasis and diabetes, with an increased risk for diabetes
in psoriasis patients, above all in those with plaque psoriasis, as
confirmed by many authors [36]–[38]. Palmoplantar psoriasis
data are more similar to that of the control group than to that
of plaque psoriasis patients. It must be taken into account that

this form of psoriasis is very particular, not very common and,
according to some authors, more related to peripheral microvascular alterations, mostly induced by smoking [39]. Statistical
and PCA analysis of the presented population confirm the ability of PCA to discriminate among the three pathological groups
and the healthy subjects considered in the amide I/II bands.
As far as the protein structure in diabetes and in psoriasis is
concerned, it is well known that in patients with diabetes several
proteins are glycated with subsequent changes in their structures
and activities. For instance, the alteration and glycation of serum
albumin and hemoglobin in patients with diabetes are well documented [40], [42]. It is probable that the presence of elevated
levels of glucose in the blood and tissues is able to induce an
alteration of the structure of the protein filaments in several areas of the human body. Moreover, in the presence of psoriasis,

384

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 63, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2016

several authors have reported alterations of protein structures
and there is a study that specifically confirms the alteration of
proteins in skin samples taken from psoriasis patients using the
same spectroscopy technique, as this paper [42], [43].
V. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, most authors consider psoriasis to be a multisystemic disease related to metabolic syndrome and diabetes.
Our findings, showing the presence of a structural alteration of
proteins in the saliva of patients with plaque psoriasis similar to
those seen in patients with diabetes, seem to confirm the hypothesis of psoriasis as a multisystemic disorder strictly related to
diabetes. Based on this hypothesis, some authors propose using
antidiabetic drugs to treat psoriasis. In any case, the possibility
of investigating psoriasis patients using a noninvasive technique
such as ATR-FTIR as reported in this paper, could be a useful
tool in following them up. In addition, continuous monitoring
of biological parameters such as saliva, certainly can improve
pharmacological treatment of these pathologies.
