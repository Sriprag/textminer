During Deep Brain Stimulation

Abstract—Parkinson’s disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by hallmark motor symptoms. It is
associated with pathological, oscillatory neural activity in the basal
ganglia. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is often successfully used to
treat medically refractive Parkinson’s disease. However, the selection of stimulation parameters is based on qualitative assessment
of the patient, which can result in a lengthy tuning period and
a suboptimal choice of parameters. This study explores fourthorder, control theory-based models of oscillatory activity in the
basal ganglia. Describing function analysis is applied to examine
possible mechanisms for the generation of oscillations in interacting nuclei and to investigate the suppression of oscillations with
high-frequency stimulation. The theoretical results for the suppression of the oscillatory activity obtained using both the fourth-order
model, and a previously described second-order model, are optimized to fit clinically recorded local field potential data obtained
from Parkinsonian patients with implanted DBS. Close agreement
between the power of oscillations recorded for a range of stimulation amplitudes is observed (R2 = 0.69 − 0.99). The results
suggest that the behavior of the system and the suppression of
pathological neural oscillations with DBS is well described by the
macroscopic models presented. The results also demonstrate that
in this instance, a second-order model is sufficient to model the clinical data, without the need for added complexity. Describing the
system behavior with computationally efficient models could aid in
the identification of optimal stimulation parameters for patients in
a clinical environment.

I. INTRODUCTION
SCILLATORY rhythms form an integral part of the central nervous system, although their exact functional significance has not yet been determined [1], [2]. In relation to
the motor function of cortical and subcortical areas of the brain,
growing evidence suggests that oscillations in the beta frequency
range (13–30 Hz), in addition to those in the gamma frequency
range (31–100 Hz), are of particular importance. Cortical beta

oscillations have been shown to display event-related desynchronization prior to the initiation of movement, suppression
during movement, with a rebound event-related synchronization immediately afterward [2]. This pattern is also observed
in the subcortical basal ganglia [1]. Cortical stimulation at 20
Hz, which lies within the beta frequency range, slows motor
output, lending weight to the causal rather than epiphenomenological nature of these oscillations [3]. Koelewijn et al. found
a stronger beta rebound occurring in response to movement errors compared to the normal rebound following the cessation of
movement, which they propose reflects involvement in an active
inhibition response [4].
The depletion of dopamine in Parkinson’s disease enhances
the rhythmic oscillatory activity compared with that present
in the healthy cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical system [5].
It is hypothesized that the normal dopaminergic system supports
the segregation of the functional subcircuits of the basal ganglia [6], with the depletion of dopamine in Parkinson’s disease
believed to cause a breakdown of this segregation, leading to
abnormal synchrony of neuronal activity [7], [8]. Parkinson’s
disease is characterized by enhanced beta rhythmical activity
in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus pars externa
(GPe) and globus pallidus pars interna (GPi), with the cerebral
cortex postulated as being a likely source of this exaggerated
synchronized activity [1]. Functional MRI has revealed an increase in the functional connectivity in the cortico-basal gangliathalamocortical system in Parkinson’s disease [9]. Although this
could occur as a consequence of the changes in the activity of
these circuits in the diseased state [10], the suggestion that the
loss of striatal dopamine could cause the changes in connectivity to occur is supported by results presented in [11] where
dynamic causal modeling was used to characterize and compare connections in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical
circuit. The connections to and from the STN were found to
strengthen and promote synchronous beta oscillations in the untreated compared to the treated Parkinsonian state [11]. In [12],
simultaneous magnetoencephalography and local field potential
(LFP) recordings in patients with Parkinson’s disease revealed
distinct coupling in the beta-band frequency between the motor cortex area and the STN providing further support of their
frequency-dependent functional connectivity. Studies in animal
models of Parkinson’s disease also support the hypothesis that
altered connectivity in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical
circuit plays a key role in the pathology of the disease [13], [14].
Bradykinesia and rigidity, hallmark motor symptoms of
Parkinson’s disease, have been shown to correlate with

synchronous beta-band oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia
[15], [16]. A correlative relationship between limb tremor in patients and oscillatory activity in the theta (or tremor) frequency
range has also been established [17]. Dopaminergic medication
has been shown to decrease the synchronous beta activity and
improve the motor symptoms of the disease [18], [19]. A recent study by Beudel et al. showed correlation between deep
brain stimulation (DBS)-induced suppression in the power of
oscillations in the low gamma frequency range (31–45 Hz) and
the reduction in the amplitude of the resting tremor recorded in
Parkinsonian patients [20]. DBS also acts to suppress the pathological oscillations in the beta frequency band, with a parallel
improvement in the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease observed [15], [21], although a direct causal link, as well as an
exact mode of action, remains yet to be established. This evidence provides support for the use of the oscillatory beta-band
activity as a biomarker of Parkinson’s disease in order to guide
the programming of DBS devices or to use in conjunction with
closed-loop systems [22], [23].
Mathematical modeling provides a valuable pathway for testing new hypotheses and gaining a greater understanding of the
cortico-basal ganglia network and DBS. Models of the corticobasal ganglia network range from detailed cellular level models
to reduced, neural mass-type models. A network model comprised of conductance-based biophysical models of each included cell type, the STN, GPe, GPi, and thalamus, introduced
by [24], has been implemented and extended in a number of subsequent studies exploring the effect of DBS [25]–[27]. Cellular
level models have also been utilized to explore the STN-GPe
pacemaking hypotheses [28], [29]. Other detailed computational
models that have been used to explore the effect of applied DBS
have also been developed [30]–[32]. However, although examination of interactions occurring at the cellular level can yield
valuable insight into possible pathological mechanisms at a local level, it seems that examining the behavior of the model
at a system level should result in a deeper understanding of
Parkinson’s disease and DBS. In addition, modeling systems at
the level of individual neurons can lead to a model becoming
unwieldy and intractable. Hence, in many studies, a phenomenologically based model, often referred to as a “neural mass” or
“lumped parameter” model, is designed, with simplifying assumptions made about the behavior at the cellular level. One of
the earliest models representing the collective dynamics of neural populations comprising of distinct excitatory and inhibitory
subpopulations was introduced by Wilson and Cowan in [33],
and forms the basis for many of the more recent neural models. Mathematical models can also be designed to illustrate and
explore a particular phenomenon occurring in a physiological
system, without a foundation on the anatomy or physiology of
the system [34].
In an attempt to gain a greater understanding of the Parkinsonian basal ganglia and the mechanism of action of DBS, a
number of models based on this phenomenological idea have
been developed. Holgado et al. demonstrated the intrinsic oscillatory capabilities of the STN-GPe network in a model based on
anatomical and electrophysiological studies [35]. Rather than
simulating the dynamics and firing times of individual neurons,

87

their model represented changes in the firing rates of neural
populations. A more comprehensive, neural mass model of the
cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit based on LFP data
recorded from a rat model of Parkinson’s disease was presented
in [13]. In this study, under simulated dopamine depletion, the
connection strength of cortical, hyperdirect input to STN was
observed to increase, and the STN input to GPe decreased.
Pathological, synchronized oscillations were modeled in a simplified manner and used to explore the effects of different types
of desynchronizing brain stimulation techniques in number of
publications from Tass et al. [36]–[38]. In a similar way, the
models we present here aim to capture the key pathological
mechanisms of Parkinson’s disease, without including details
of the cellular morphology of the system. This is to allow the
models to be readily explored and analyzed, and track the complex system in a simplified manner, without reverse engineering,
the failing basal ganglia [39].
In [40], a second-order macroscopic mathematical model
used to represent oscillatory activity of a synchronous group
of neurons was presented. The model was tuned to specifically
capture key features of the physiological system representing
a closed loop within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical
system and to generate the pathological oscillations that occur
here in Parkinson’s disease. The suppression of these oscillations by the injection of high-frequency stimulation was examined, and the results compared to clinical data previously
published in [41]. However, the model analyzed is the simplest
that can generate oscillatory activity, and the analysis presented
cannot readily be extended to higher order models. More complex, higher order models may more accurately represent the dynamics of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical system by modeling
the interaction of two or more nuclei, allowing the parameters
of each to be varied individually.
This study examines and analyzes two fourth-order models of
oscillatory activity with the aim of capturing the dynamics of the
system being considered while remaining analytically tractable.
In developing the models, we consider the cortico-basal gangliathalamocortical system as a complex network of coupled nuclei,
in which the level of synchronization and coupling between neurons within and across different nuclei increases as dopamine
is depleted in Parkinson’s disease. Within this network, under
conditions of dopamine depletion, the enhanced coupling may
lead the reciprocally connected STN-GPe loop to act as a central pacemaker, as discussed in [42], or alternatively, the entire
network may experience a loss of segregation [17] reducing
to a simpler, tightly coupled network of interacting oscillators.
Each fourth-order model is based on a combination of two of
the previously described second-order models. A series model
with separate self-oscillating feedback loops, and a reduced
fourth-order series model are both considered. The describing
function is applied to analyze the models. Two describing functions are combined in a novel way, enabling the application of
this established theory to the fourth-order models. The theoretical analysis presented is extendable to higher order models,
providing a framework for the theoretical analysis of more complex networks modeled in this way, similar to that described in
[43]. Possible mechanisms for the generation of pathological

oscillatory activity are explored by studying the interaction of
the two distinct nuclei. The suppression of oscillations with the
application of high-frequency stimulation representing DBS is
examined in the fourth-order series (reduced) model. In order to
examine whether the addition of a second nuclei improves the
accuracy of the model, the theoretical results obtained for the
fourth-order series (reduced) model, and the original secondorder model, are compared to clinically recorded LFP data, and
the fits obtained are compared. Both models are shown to be capable of capturing the dynamics of the beta-band LFP activity
as the amplitude of the applied DBS is increased. The models
presented in this study are designed with the aim of being readily analyzed such that their translation to a clinical environment
as a tool to aid in the identification of optimal DBS parameters
on a patient by patient basis would be possible.
II. METHODS
Oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia can be recorded in the
form of the LFP. LFPs reflect the summation of local, rhythmic,
synchronized subthreshold activity in presynaptic terminals and
postsynaptic neurons [7], [44]. The models presented in this
study aim to capture the dynamics of the cortico-basal gangliathalamocortical system as they appear to an external observer,
by reproducing the synchronized oscillatory activity recorded
in the vicinity of the STN. Although comparisons are drawn
between the models and the physiological system, each secondorder nucleus, consisting of a nonlinear, sigmoidal arctan function in series with a second-order transfer function, essentially
represents a reduced oscillating system. The individual, physiological components modeled by each nucleus are assumed to
display synchronous dynamics. This system-level model of the
neural population explored in this study follows concepts of
neural mass modeling [45].
The fourth-order models each consist of two reciprocally
connected second-order models, which are used to represent
two distinct neural ensembles connected in series, Figs. 1 and
2. These could be chosen to represent any two individual
interconnected nuclei. For example, each loop in Fig. 1 could
represent a nucleus with self-excitation that would enable it to
generate oscillations, or two coupled nuclei, which form a single
oscillator, as is considered in [40]. The STN-GPe loop could be
modeled as shown in Fig. 2. The choice of excitatory-inhibitory
interconnections between the two nuclei reflects the physiological interconnections existing between both the cortex and basal
ganglia, and the STN and GPe [46]. The theoretical analysis
presented here, based on describing function analysis, can be
extended to include as many individual groups of neurons as required. A complete description of the second-order model, and
the associated analysis, is provided in an earlier paper [40].
Imaging and electrophysiological studies indicate that the depletion of dopamine in Parkinson’s disease is associated with an
increase in the functional connectivity within the basal ganglia,
leading to abnormal, synchronous neural activity [9], [47]. Connectivity is modulated by the parameter hn , which represents the
effect of dopamine on the system; a decrease in hn leads to an
increase in the gain (or functional connectivity) of the system,

resulting in an increase in the amplitude of the model output.
Mathematically, as hn decreases, the slope of the sigmoid, and
thus, the responsiveness of the feedback loop, increases.
A. Fourth-Order Series Model (With Feedback)
In order to explore mechanisms by which oscillatory neural activity can be generated through the interaction of
different frequencies, a fourth-order model of the basal gangliathalamocortical system is presented and analyzed using the describing function approach. Interaction between distinct loops,
either tuned to oscillate at a particular frequency or inherently
nonoscillating, can give rise to oscillations at other frequencies. The fourth-order series model (with feedback) presented in
Fig. 1, consists of two second-order models of oscillatory activity coupled with two variable gain terms, g1 and g2 . The coupling
shown in Fig. 1 is an excitatory-inhibitory configuration. This
reflects the physiological excitatory-inhibitory interconnections

DAVIDSON et al.: ANALYSIS OF OSCILLATORY NEURAL ACTIVITY IN SERIES NETWORK MODELS OF PARKINSON’S DISEASE

that exist between either the STN-GPe, or the cortex-basal ganglia. Within the fourth-order series model (with feedback), each
second-order model includes an individual feedback loop, and
is capable of oscillatory activity when appropriately tuned. The
parameters of the second-order models can be chosen such that
they are nonoscillating, or initialized to oscillate at either the
same or different frequencies, with the frequency of the resulting output from the model changing as a function of the gain
in the loop, g1 g2 . The interaction of two different initial frequencies is examined through simulation of the model with the
interconnections in an excitatory-excitatory configuration. This
was achieved by setting g1 = −g2 .
To facilitate the theoretical analysis, the initial frequencies
of oscillation of the two nuclei are chosen equal, b = b1 = b2 ,
and k1 = k2 = b. The coupling gains, g1 and g2 in Fig. 1 are
chosen to be equal and denoted as g in the following. Each node
in the loop can be expressed, using phasor notation, with Z1 the
reference phasor, as
Z1 = Ym

Z2 = D1 (Ym ) · Ym

without the individual feedback connections included in the
model described in Section II-A. The nuclei in this configuration are not capable of oscillating individually, but will begin to
oscillate once the coupling gain between them reaches a critical
value. High-frequency stimulation representative of DBS is also
included. DBS is modeled here as a biphasic, rectangular waveform, with an amplitude of stimulation a and fractional pulse
duration α, and is applied additively at the input to a nonlinear element, Fig. 2. This is analogous to adding the stimulation
to the synaptic input of the neurons in the network, consistent
with orthodromic driving of the neuron. As described in [40],
the addition of this high-frequency stimulation to the system
essentially counteracts the increase in the slope of the nonlinear element, and subsequent increased excitability, caused by
a decrease in hn , thereby suppressing the oscillatory activity
induced. Experimental [48] and simulation [49] studies at the
cellular level indicate that DBS does elicit its effect through
antidromic and orthodromic activation of target neurons.
In order to analyze the fourth-order series model (reduced)
shown in Fig. 2, the applied high-frequency stimulation, representative of DBS, is mathematically combined with the nonlinear element N L1 resulting in an equivalent nonlinear element
[50], [51]. As described in [40], describing function analysis
techniques from [52] are applied to find a linear approximation
of the gain of this equivalent nonlinear element, calculated as

The describing function of the original nonlinearity, N L2 , is

Stimulation is then applied to the system and the effect of varying a, the amplitude of applied stimulation, α, the fractional

of h1 is examined.

which sets the critical value of the composition of describing
functions to that for which oscillations will occur in the fourthorder series model (reduced). Letting k = b2 in (28) results in
a threshold value, to ascertain whether oscillatory activity is
present in the system, equal to 4. For oscillations to occur in the
system, the phase condition must also be satisfied; that is, the
phase difference around the feedback loop must sum to zero.
Each transfer function contributes a phase difference of − π2 ,
and when combined with the negative feedback in the model
yields a total phase difference of zero.
In order to examine the effects of changing the parameters
and the stimulation applied to the model on the amplitude of
the oscillations, the intersection point between the describing
function and the threshold for generation of oscillations is calculated for a range of parameter values. First, the amplitude
of oscillations, denoted Ym , is calculated as a function of h1 ,

To verify the behavior of the model in comparison to the
physiological system, the model parameters of the fourth-order
series model (reduced) were optimized to fit clinical LFP data
recorded postoperatively. The data were recorded at the Department of Clinical Neurology, University of Oxford, and at the
University College of London, from four patients with Parkinson’s disease who had undergone bilateral implantation of DBS
electrodes into the STN. All patients gave their informed consent to take part in the study, which was approved by the local
ethics committees of the University of Oxford or University
College of London. The permanent quadripolar macroelectrode
implanted was model 3387 (Medtronic Neurologic Division,
Minneapolis, MN, USA). Bipolar LFPs were captured using
a single channel, isolated, high-gain (100 dB) amplifier with
a pass band of 4–40 Hz from contact pairs 0–2 or 1–3 (contact 0 being the most caudal and contact 3 the most rostral
contact) and recorded onto a PC via a 1401 data acquisition
system (Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd., Cambridge, U.K.).
Data were recorded with a sampling frequency of 2.2 kHz, except in one patient where a sampling rate of 200 Hz was used.
Recordings were obtained after overnight withdrawal from patients’ usual antiparkinsonian medication while the patients sat
comfortably in a chair. Patients were stimulated monopolarly
at either contact 1 (if the LFP was captured from contacts 0–
2) or contact 2 (if the LFP was captured from contacts 1–3).
Stimulation and recording contact pairs were determined according to which bipolar LFP contacts exhibited highest beta
power. To determine this, two short recordings of 100 s were
made in the absence of stimulation from contact pairs 0–2 and
1–3. Power spectral density was calculated offline using Spike2
(Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd., Cambridge, U.K.). Based
on this assessment, for each patient the LFPs were recorded as
the stimulation amplitude, delivered via the external stimulator
(Medtronic Neurologic Division, Minneapolis, MN, USA), was
varied while the stimulation frequency and pulse duration were
kept fixed, at 130 Hz and either 60 or 90 μs, respectively.
The raw data were imported from Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design Ltd., Cambridge, U.K.) and processed using
custom developed software (MATLAB 7.12, The MathWorks
Inc., Natick, MA, USA, 2011). Each dataset was filtered using a tenth-order Butterworth filter with cutoff frequencies
13 < f < 35 Hz in order to examine the data in the beta frequency range. To calculate the amplitude of the oscillations for
each stimulation setting, the root mean square (RMS) value
of 5 s epochs, with an 80% overlap, were calculated. In each
case, the epochs were chosen to begin 10 s after the adjustment
to the stimulation took place. The amplitude of the beta-band
oscillations in the LFP data for each stimulation setting was
calculated as the average of the 5 s RMS values, converted to

component of the oscillatory activity. Both ensembles are initialized to oscillate
at 10 Hz, with the model in the excitatory-inhibitory configuration. The theoretically predicted frequencies based on (18) are shown, as well as the frequency of
the output from simulations of the system for 
discrete values of coupling gain.
The geometric mean of the two frequencies,

constant and is also illustrated. Note that a single frequency can give rise to any

D. Model Analysis
In addition to the theoretical analysis, both of the fourthorder series models were implemented and simulated using a
commercial software package (Simulink, MATLAB 7.12, The
MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA, 2011).
In order to fit the theoretical output of the fourth-order series
model (reduced) to the clinical data, the model parameters were
optimized to fit each individual dataset using the Levenberg–
Marquardt algorithm to minimize the difference between the
power of the clinically recorded LFP data and the model estimates of the oscillation power. The R2 values, indicating the
agreement between the model predictions and the clinical data,
were calculated for each fitted dataset. This procedure was repeated with the previously presented second-order model [40]
and the same sets of clinical data to enable a comparison to be
drawn between the two models.

model (with feedback) as a function of coupling gain. f1 and f2 denote a frequency component of the oscillatory activity. The frequencies converge to their
geometric mean, and then decrease with increasing gain. The points illustrated
were obtained through simulation of the system shown in Fig. 1, with the networks set to initially oscillate at two different frequencies (11 and 24 Hz), with
the coupling between the networks in the excitatory-excitatory configuration.

III. RESULTS
A. Fourth-Order Series Model (With Feedback)
The effect of increasing the amplitude of the coupling gain in
the fourth-order series model (with feedback), Fig. 1, is illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5. Fig. 4 shows the frequencies present as
a function of coupling gain when both ensembles are initialized
to oscillate at the same frequency (10 Hz), with excitatoryinhibitory coupling of the model. This is achieved by taking
h1 = 0.3 and b = 5π. Both the theoretically predicted frequencies based on (18), and frequencies measured from the output of
the simulated system for discrete values of gain are presented.
As the coupling gain in the network is increased, the frequencies diverge, with this behavior also observed in the model

simulations. The geometric mean of the frequencies, which is
illustrated in Fig. 4, remains approximately constant.
Fig. 5 illustrates the frequencies of the simulated model output obtained when the individual networks shown in Fig. 1
are initialized to oscillate at different frequencies (11 and 24
Hz), again as the amplitude of the coupling gain is increased.
This is achieved by setting b1 = 5.5π and b2 = 12π. The two
frequencies are observed to converge towards an intermediate
frequency with increasing gain. When the frequencies converge,
the single resultant frequency decreases gradually as the gain is
increased further. These results are based on simulations of the
system shown in Fig. 1 with the excitatory-excitatory system
configuration used, g1 = −g2 .

C. Comparison of Models with Experimental Data

Fig. 7. Amplitude of oscillations (normalized values) in the fourth-order series
model (reduced) of neural synchrony as a function of the frequency of applied
stimulation. Four different amplitudes of stimulation are presented. h 1 is chosen
to be 0.1 in each.

B. Fourth-Order Series Model (Reduced)
The describing function analysis developed here enables the
amplitude of the oscillations present in the system to be calculated as a function of the parameter h1 , representing the
dopamine level in the system. The oscillations increased in amplitude as the parameter h1 was decreased. The amplitude of
oscillations in the model for any particular fixed value of h1 can
be evaluated analytically for a range of applied stimulation parameters, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. In each case, the amplitude
of oscillations present in the system is shown normalized with
respect to the amplitude without stimulation applied. In Fig. 6,
the amplitude of oscillations are plotted as a function of the
amplitude of the applied stimulation, a, for four separate pulse
durations. The amplitude of the oscillations is decreased as the
amplitude of the stimulation is increased, with the oscillations
suppressed more readily as the pulse duration is increased. Fig. 7
shows the amplitude of oscillations within the series network
plotted as a function of frequency for four different amplitudes
of stimulation. The amplitude of the oscillations is decreased as
the frequency of the applied stimulation is increased. The suppression achieved is increased as the amplitude of the applied
stimulation is increased. In each case, h1 = 0.1.

The parameters of the original second-order model and the
fourth-order series model (reduced) were optimized for each
patient independently. The model parameters and stimulation
settings identified for each dataset are given in Table I and
Table II, and the experimental and theoretically predicted data
are compared in Fig. 8. The amplitude of oscillations in the
experimental dataset are normalized with respect to the off-DBS
recording for that patient. In each case, the pulse duration was
fixed at either 60 or 90 μs as the amplitude of the stimulation
was varied.
IV. DISCUSSION
It is hypothesized that the healthy basal ganglia consists of
functionally distinct networks that lose their segregation under
conditions of dopamine depletion, leading to pathological oscillatory activity [7], [8]. Amassed evidence from the literature
supports the proposal that the pathological oscillations observed
in Parkinson’s disease arise as a result of the interaction of two or
more populations of synchronized neurons. In this study, control
theory has been used in order to gain insight into the generation and interaction of oscillatory activity in two simplified network models each representing two interacting populations of
neurons.
Specifically, describing function analysis provides a method
of exploring and understanding the oscillatory activity in both
of the fourth-order series models of neural synchrony presented
in this study, including the effect of applying high-frequency
stimulation to the oscillations produced. The method of combining two describing functions is a novel approach, which allows the application of the well-established engineering tool

to the fourth-order series models presented. This method can
also be extended to the analysis of higher order models with a
greater number of interacting nuclei, which may provide a more
accurate representation of the physiological system in question,
while still remaining analytically tractable. Although the method
of describing function analysis was the one chosen and applied
here, other techniques such as bifurcation analysis could equally
be utilized in order to characterize the oscillatory activity of the
models presented here.
The analysis of the fourth-order series model (with feedback) explores how the output frequency or frequencies of the
produced oscillatory activity depend on the coupling gain of
the model. For reciprocally connected loops of two oscillating
interconnected networks, with excitatory-inhibitory interconnections, initialized to oscillate at the same frequency, two divergent frequencies emerge as the coupling gain between the
nuclei is increased. The geometric mean of these two frequencies remains approximately constant; see Fig. 4. When the coupled loops are set to oscillate at different initial frequencies, with
excitatory-excitatory interconnections, the frequencies converge
as the coupling gain is increased. As the gain is increased above
that at which the frequencies converge, this resultant frequency
decreases slightly from that of the initial convergence point; see
Fig. 5. Similar results were demonstrated with a more physiologically detailed study of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical
network [31], where the interaction of oscillations at different
frequencies in the cortex and STN were examined and found to
result in a new, intermediate frequency of synchronized oscillations under dopamine depleted conditions (increased coupling
gain). The geometric mean of the converging frequencies was
also observed to remain approximately constant [31].
Oscillatory activity recorded from the cortico-basal gangliathalamocortical network has been shown to occur at a range

of frequencies. Given the increased functional connectivity between these loops that occurs in Parkinson’s disease [9], it is
likely that interaction between loops of different frequencies
does occur. The measured LFP likely reflects activity generated
by synchronous synaptic inputs to the STN, including afferent
inputs from the cortex through the hyperdirect pathway, along
with inputs from the GPe and other interconnecting nuclei. In
[53], bispectral analysis of LFP data recorded from the STN of
Parkinsonian patients revealed a nonlinear correlative relationship between LFP rhythms of different frequencies, which was
decreased after dopaminergic medication. Marceglia et al. suggested that the loss of dopamine in Parkinson’s disease causes
a loss of segregation between different LFP rhythms [53], and
that the nonlinear interactions observed could arise as a result of
the synchronization between two or more populations of neurons [54]. In particular, overactivity in the hyperdirect pathway
has been postulated as playing a critical part in the generation of
the pathological oscillations associated with Parkinson’s disease
[13], [14], [55]. The theoretical and simulated results presented
here suggest some possible mechanisms by which the pathological oscillatory activity observed in Parkinson’s disease may
occur via a similar loss of segregation or increased coupling gain
between the individual nuclei. The results in Fig. 5 show how
frequencies in the low beta range (16 Hz) can be produced by
combining 11 and 24 Hz oscillations in two separate networks
and increasing the coupling gain. Similarly, two diverging frequencies of oscillation are shown to emerge from the series with
feedback network arrangement of two nuclei with initially equal
frequencies of oscillation, illustrated for 10 Hz; see Fig. 4.
The fourth-order series model (reduced), representative of
two synchronous nuclei, predicts oscillatory activity that grows
in amplitude as the parameter h1 is decreased causing an increase in the excitability of the loop. For any chosen frequency

94

and initial amplitude of oscillations, the theoretical analysis predicts that the oscillatory activity decreases in amplitude as either
the frequency, pulse duration, or amplitude of the applied stimulation, representing DBS, is increased; see Figs. 6 and 7. The
suppression of oscillations in this way can also be described as
a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. As the amplitude of applied
stimulation is increased the stable oscillations in the system disappear. This description of the changes in dynamics induced
in an oscillatory network by the application of high-frequency
stimulation as a Hopf bifurcation was first observed by Titcombe
et al. [34].
The theoretical results of varying amplitude of stimulation
for fixed frequency and pulse duration were fitted to clinically
recorded LFP data from four individual Parkinsonian patients
using optimization, with the R2 values calculated as 0.96, 0.69,
0.79, and 0.99, respectively, indicating a good agreement between the model and the clinical values. The output of the original second-order model explored in [40] was fitted to the same
clinically recorded LFP datasets. The R2 values of this fit were
calculated as 0.96, 0.69, 0.78, and 0.99. The similarity between
the fits obtained to the clinical data for both the second- and
fourth-order models indicate that the addition of a second nucleus to the network does not improve the accuracy of the model
in representing the dynamics of the Parkinsonian LFP in the
datasets examined. Indeed, the second-order model examined
in our earlier study [40], and a third-order model described in
a study by Titcombe et al. [34], have been shown to accurately
capture the dynamics of a clinical data set obtained from the
literature [41].
A decrease in h1 in the model is analogous to the depletion of
dopamine in Parkinson’s disease, with the resulting increased
amplitude of the oscillatory activity mimicking that observed
in LFP data recorded from the pathological basal ganglia. An
improvement in motor symptoms in patients is seen to occur in
parallel with either a drug, or DBS-induced, suppression of this
oscillatory activity [15], [18], [19], [21]. Furthermore, clinical
studies report a progressive improvement in the motor symptoms of the disease as the amplitude, and to a lesser extent,
the frequency and pulse duration, of the applied DBS is increased [56]–[58]. As a causal relationship between a decrease
in beta-band oscillations and motor symptom reduction has not
yet been proven, the suppression of the oscillatory activity in
the model with high-frequency stimulation cannot be taken as
translating directly into a clinical improvement in the motor
symptoms. However, evidence from recent studies lends weight
to the use of the beta-band oscillatory activity as a biomarker of
the disease, which supports this representation.
Mathematical models of the cortico-basal gangliathalamocortical region provide a pathway to further understanding of the underlying pathological oscillatory activity of Parkinson’s disease. Using models, hypotheses can be easily tested,
developed and refined. Comparisons can be made between models of differing levels of complexity in addition to direct comparisons with clinical data, where model complexity allows.
The models presented in this study have the advantage of being
easily manipulated and analytically tractable. This may facilitate their translation to a clinical environment where they could

be used as a tool to aid in the choice of stimulation parameters. They can be tuned to match individual patient disease
characteristics—the model parameters b, k, and h1 can be chosen to tune the output to whatever the dominant frequency and
amplitude of oscillation recorded from the patient is. The stimulation parameters can then be chosen based on the level of
suppression required, although it is likely, due to the interpatient variability observed in LFP data [8], that the suppression
required may be patient specific. Translation of the model to a
clinical environment would involve restricting the optimization
of the model parameters to a certain area of the parameter space
in order to comply with clinically safe levels of stimulation, and
to minimize side effects. This method could also be extended
to include tuning of the model using alternative, more readily
recordable potential biomarkers of Parkinson’s disease, for example, electromyography or limb tremor. Although the focus in
this study is on beta-band oscillations in two interacting nuclei,
the models presented can also be extended to include a number
of nuclei oscillating at a range of different frequencies based
on physiological recordings, and used to study the interaction
of these as the gain of the system is increased, mimicking the
increased functional connectivity that occurs with the depletion
of dopamine. The theoretical analyses outlined can be extended
to higher order models based on combinations of the two basic
network architectures presented in this study.
The models presented here represent two interacting nuclei
displaying synchronous oscillatory dynamics. This is based on
the hypothesis that the pathological oscillatory activity observed
in Parkinson’s disease arises as a result of the loss of functional
segregation in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical system. However, the reduction of the system to include just two subnetworks may well be an oversimplification. In addition, although
the models presented in this study provide good agreement with
the clinically recorded LFP data, it is important to note that, as
mean-field type models, much physiological accuracy and detail is neglected, and therefore, some of the effect of the subtle
relationships and interactions between neurons are lost. Similarly, the stimulation representing DBS is applied additively at
the input to one nuclei, with no consideration given to the interaction of the stimulation pulse with the tissue surrounding the
electrode. Finally, the use of the describing function analysis is
an approximation method, however, its application to models
presented here is justified by ensuring the appropriate specifications are met in the model, and by confirming the theoretical
results achieved through simulation of the model.
V. CONCLUSION
Mathematical models of the cortico-basal gangliathalamocortical network that capture the key features of the
physiological system in order to produce a faithful representation of the dynamics, while remaining analytically tractable,
are particularly valuable. The results presented in this study
demonstrate that both the second-order and fourth-order series
(reduced) models provide close agreement between the model
output and clinical data. Therefore the second-order model is
sufficient to represent the system, with the added complexity of

DAVIDSON et al.: ANALYSIS OF OSCILLATORY NEURAL ACTIVITY IN SERIES NETWORK MODELS OF PARKINSON’S DISEASE

the fourth-order model, in this case, unnecessary. The agreement
observed offers the possibility that the model could be translated
to a clinical tool to aid in DBS parameter selection. The model
could conceivably be tuned to represent an individual patients
pathological state using a biomarker of Parkinson’s disease. The
analytically tractable theoretical analysis established here can
readily be extended to higher order models also, thus providing a valuable framework with which to examine and test new
models of this type.
