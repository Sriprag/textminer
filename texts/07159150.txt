Corrections to “Noninvasive Imaging of the High Frequency Brain Activity
in Focal Epilepsy Patients”
Yunfeng Lu, Gregory A. Worrell, Huishi Clara Zhang, Lin Yang, Benjamin Brinkmann, Cindy Nelson, and Bin He∗
Physical units in Figs 3–5 in [1] were found mistyped. The
corrected figures are shown below.

Fig. 5. Results in Patient 5. (a) Left: Raw EEG; Right: High-pass filtered EEG
above 30 Hz. HF activity is marked with red circle. (b) Spatial map and temporal
activation of one HF component. (c) Source imaging results of HF activity.
(d) Seizure onset zone of intracranial recording is highlighted with red dots.
Fig. 3. Results in Patient 1. (a) Left: Raw EEG; Right: High-pass filtered EEG
above 30 Hz. HF activity is marked with red circle. (b) Spatial map and temporal
activation of one HF component. (c) Source imaging results of HF activity.
(d) Surgical resection is highlighted in red.
