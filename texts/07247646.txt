Abstract— Goal: The aim of this study is to develop a novel fully
wireless and batteryless technology for cardiac pacing. Methods:
This technology uses radio frequency (RF) energy to power the implanted electrode in the heart. An implantable electrode antenna
was designed for 1.2 GHz; then, it was tested in vitro and, subsequently, integrated with the rectifier and pacing circuit to make a
complete electrode. The prototype implanted electrode was tested
in vivo in an ovine subject, implanting it on the epicardial surface
of the left ventricle. The RF energy, however, was transmitted to
the implanted electrode using a horn antenna positioned 25 cm
above the thorax of the sheep. Results: It was demonstrated that
a small implanted electrode can capture and harvest enough safe
recommended RF energy to achieve pacing. Electrocardiogram signals were recorded during the experiments, which demonstrated
asynchronous pacing achieved at three different rates. Conclusion:
These results show that the proposed method has a great potential
to be used for stimulating the heart and provides pacing, without
requiring any leads or batteries. It hence has the advantage of potentially lasting indefinitely and may never require replacement
during the life of the patient. Significance: The proposed method
brings forward transformational possibilities in wireless cardiac
pacing, and also in powering up the implantable devices.

I. INTRODUCTION
ARDIAC resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices are of
significance in the current era, as they have the potential to
greatly improve patient outcomes. Today, more than three million people worldwide have a pacemaker and its need is even
increasing, as heart failure (HF) alone affects more than 5.1
million people in the United States and 25 million worldwide

[1]. Although the conventional cardiac pacemakers improve the
quality of life and reduce mortality, there are problems associated with them, due to many potential procedure- and devicerelated complications [2]. Among all components, the pacing
lead is considered to be the weakest link of the cardiac pacing system, but serves as a conduit for the delivery of energy
pulses to provide myocardial stimulation [3]. Leads can produce
venous obstruction and are prone to insulation breaks, conductor fracture, and even infection [4]–[7]. In addition to the lead
complications, CRT is currently delivered epicardially via the
coronory sinus, whose anatomy can make implantation difficult
to achieve the optimal pacing site [8].
Inductive radio frequency (RF)-based pacemakers were first
reported in [10] and [11]. Very recently, the first ever implantation of leadless endocardial pacing using ultrasound was performed on humans [12]. Also, St. Jude [13] and Medtronic [14]
have recently been developing miniaturized prototype pacemakers, which are currently going through clinical trials in Europe
and the USA. Both St. Jude’s Nanostim and Medtronic’s Micra
Transcatheter Pacing System are the latest innovative devices
for implantation in the right ventricle. However, there is still
a need for a batteryless device, which would potentially make
multiple site pacing practical and address the unmet clinical
needs of the CRT nonresponders.
The objective of this paper is to propose and demonstrate a
novel method of leadless cardiac pacing, as shown in Fig. 1. This
does not require leads or electrode batteries and has the ability
to pace multiple sites of the heart, not just a single chamber. This

is achieved by exploring the integration of implantable antennas with radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting techniques to
power the pacemaker for myocardial stimulation. The proposed
solution has a significant advantage over all the aforementioned
methods because batteries are not required for the operation of
the implanted electrodes, which saves almost half of the available space. Furthermore, the proposed technology has a significant advantage over the ultrasound based system because it is
completely wireless and allows multiple electrodes to be implanted without a pulse generator or pacemaker lead. Moreover,
this technology allows the flexibility of pacing multiple sites of
the heart without the need of any leads.
In particular, this study presents the design and demonstration
of a complete wireless and batteryless electrode for cardiac
pacing. The electrode is comprised of an implanted rectenna, an
impedance matching circuit, and a charging circuit, as well as
a microprocessor-based pacing circuit. A detailed flow diagram
of the system design is depicted in Fig. 2. A planar microstrip
receiver antenna with complimentary split ring resonator-loaded
ground plane was first optimized for the miniaturization and then
matched with an efficient rectifier circuit for maximum power
transfer between the rectenna and the pacing circuit. A ceramic
capacitor was used to store the charge before delivering it to the
pacing circuit to provide pacing and stimulate the tissue. The
two-layer wireless electrode prototype was fabricated in house
and enclosed in a small enclosure. Finally, the wireless electrode
was tested in vivo (ovine subject) to validate the concept and
demonstrate the pacing. The electrocardiogram (ECG) results
showed that the pacing was achieved at three different rates:
110, 120, and 130 beats/min (bpm).
Implantable antennas and energy harvesting for the implantable biomedical devices exhibit numerous challenges in

1071

terms of design, fabrication, and testing, as summarized in
[15]–[17]. The guidelines for designing implantable antennas
in different environments are presented in [18] and [19]. Many
researchers have designed and developed different types of
antennas for implantable applications including planar loops,
inverted-F, monopoles, dipoles, spirals, meanders, and microstrips antennas [15], [20]–[32]. For many years, inductive
telemetry has been used to power pacemakers [33] and for data
transmission in implantable applications [34], [35], but its uses
have been limited by the quality and size of the implanted coil.
For cardiac telemetry, a dipole [21] and microstrip [22] embedded in the shoulder were analyzed using the finite-difference
time-domain method. Recently, the use of preexisting vascular
stents as antennas have been examined, but no in vivo results
have been presented [24], [25]. Although the stent-antenna uses
preapproved biocompatible materials, it is still not ready for use
in certain vessels, and hence, not recommended to be used in
the heart chambers [25]. A miniaturized circularly polarized microstrip antenna has recently been tested in pork for implantable
applications [36].
The key components of an implantable rectenna are the implantable antenna, rectifier circuit, and matching circuit. An efficient rectenna is crucial for the delivery of wireless power [32],
[37]–[46]. While there has been a huge interest in the rectennas
for air, limited work has been reported for implantable applications. An implantable rectenna design for triple-band biotelemetry communication has been demonstrated in vitro [43]. Marnat
et al. designed an on-chip antenna for wireless power and data
transfer for the implantable intraocular pressure monitoring applications [42]. A flexible dipole rectenna array fabricated on
a cellulose membrane has been proposed for the biomedical
applications, but has a large size and only 56% conversion efficiency [47]. Recently, a miniature energy harvesting rectenna
using Planar inverted-F antenna and a spiral design was proposed for deep brain stimulation, but no in vivo results have
been shown [48]. Previous studies described in [25] and [49]
used ANSYS High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) and
conducted in vivo experiments to validate the power transfer
from a stent-based radiator implanted deep within the body.
This paper is structured as follows: Section II is a preliminary
section, in which the system design topology and its constraints
are presented. Section III is dedicated to the selection and design
of the implantable antenna, its concepts, workings, and parametric analysis. Section IV discusses the topology of the rectifier
circuit and its efficiency, as well as illustrates the full schematic
of the system. Section V describes the pacing circuit and the
load, while Section VI explains the validation and fabrication of
the prototype. Measurement and in vivo surgeries are described
in Section VII, while results and discussions are summarized in
Section VIII. The paper ends with a conclusion and future study
recommendations in Section IX.
II. SYSTEM DESIGN TOPOLOGY AND PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS
The topology configuration of the proposed implantable electrode for cardiac pacing is shown in Fig. 3. Designing a system
with an antenna for use in the deep human body is comparatively different and more complex than designing it for air or

subcutaneous applications, due to the physical constraints and
electromagnetic specifications. As shown in Fig. 3, the antenna
is not the only implant, but is a part of the complete active implantable system. Hence, it needs to be miniaturized without
compromising on its gain. Critical to its practicality, the volume
of this system must be small and able to fit in a small housing.
Furthermore, since the human body tissue is highly conductive
and prone to the adverse tissue reaction, the device has to be embedded well in a biocompatible insulation to avoid these issues
[51]–[53]. Compact packaging is also required to reduce the
overall volume. The complete system is hence designed in layers as discussed in Section VI. It should be noted that the actual
antenna manufacturing process has limitations too, which have
to be considered during the simulation and optimization stage.
III. IMPLANTABLE ANTENNA DESIGN
This section describes the realization of an efficient implantable antenna at 1.2 GHz.
A. Design Methodology and Selection of the Antenna
The intended goal was to design a linearly polarized antenna
at 1.2 GHz for implantation on the heart tissue, deep inside
the body. Considering the overall volume of the electrode, the
antenna dimensions were set to 10 ×10 mm2 . To overcome
all the physical and design constraints, the following design
procedures were followed:
1) The antenna was designed in free space without considering any dielectric substrates and phantoms. This process
helped in reducing the simulation time and allowed an
approximation to select an efficient design.
2) The excitation methods were investigated and the antenna
topology was selected accordingly.
3) The antenna design was tuned after adding the dielectric
substrate and body phantom.
4) The antenna structure was modified to integrate the matching and rectifier circuit.
These steps are helpful to understand how the final antenna
structure was developed and achieved. Besides the miniaturization and biocompatibility, the selected antenna model should
allow extensive parametrization and a good degree of freedom
in the design. An extensive study of the antenna designs, such
as meander line, spiral, multilayered and microstrip patch, was
performed to choose an antenna structure that was efficient for
the given volume and that had a fast computational performance

(in free space). Following the analysis of the radiation characteristics and the concept of current distribution of these antennas
[54], a microstrip patch was selected. Microstrip patch design
has a good history in implantable applications and provides flexibility in the design, shape, and conformability, as reviewed in
[15]. The use of a patch antenna allows several miniaturization
techniques [53] that can be employed to achieve the required
size and resonance frequency. The antenna having to be implanted into the heart tissue helped further in miniaturization
because tissue has a higher dielectric constant than fat.
B. Human Body Model and Numerical Methods
Many possibilities of the equivalent body models are available
with different complexities, as reported in [55]–[57]. Realization of a single body phantom for different frequency ranges is
complex [58], and hence, a broad frequency range was achieved
only with equivalent properties of a skull in [59]. Following
the recommendations in [60], a simple homogeneous cylinder
with values of dielectric properties of the muscle [61], [62] is
used in this study. This is an approximation but it does provide
a standard and is useful to realize conditions for the antenna
measurements in less time [63]. The electric properties of the
tissue model used in the simulations at 1.2 GHz are given in
Table I.
Performance of the antenna was examined using the properties given in Table I. The antenna was implanted 6 cm under the
skin, deep inside the tissue, with its ground being placed on the
heart’s surface. All the simulations were performed using a fullwave 3-D electromagnetic simulation tool, Ansoft’s-ANSYS
HFSS, which enabled efficient modeling of anatomical body
parts. To achieve the stability of the numerical calculations and
extend the radiation infinitely far, the absorbing boundaries were
set at λ0 /2 away from the antenna in the simulation setups.
C. Miniaturization of the Antenna Using CSRRs
Complimentary Split Ring Resonators (CSRRs) have attracted much attention and have been used extensively due to
their metamaterial properties and attractive performance characteristics [64]. Applications of metamaterials in medical imaging,
microwave hyperthermia, wireless strain sensing, and specific
absorption rate reduction have been reviewed recently in [65].
Applications of CSRRs for miniaturization and improving directivity have been investigated in [66]. The CSRR unit cell
was introduced in the ground to miniaturize the antenna, which
also facilitated a good impedance match to the source, a nearly
broadside radiation pattern, and a high radiation efficiency. In
addition to CSRR, several other methods have been presented
in the literature to reduce the size of patch antennas, including
the use of shorting posts [67], loading of reactive elements [68],

and the use of reactive impedance surfaces [67]. An investigation into the design of compact patch antenna loaded with
CSRR and reactive impedance surfaces, together with their performance analysis has been reported in [69]. Very recently, a
combination of CSRRs and reactive pin loading has been presented in [70], which demonstrated a size reduction of 30% and
44% while using CSRR alone and with the addition of active
pins, respectively.
Unlike the study reported in [66], Cheng et al. proposed the
use of a CSRR in the radiating patch instead and designed a
compact patch antenna for wireless endoscopy [71]. Despite its
proposed implantable application, the body dielectric properties were not considered in this design and also no in vitro or
in vivo results were measured. A similar concept of miniaturization using the CSRR is employed in our study. We have also
considered the equivalent body model with correct dielectric
properties, which strongly influences the antenna design.

ground plane. (a) Top view and (b) bottom view. Structure characteristics are
(in mm): a = 2.3, b = 1.1, c = 1.2, d = 0.5, e = 3.8, W = 8.5, L = 9.8, S 1

= 4.5, L 3 = 3.7.

D. CSRR Unit Cell
The metamaterial property of the CSRR unit cell (i.e., its
negative permittivity and left handed propagation) has been realized in [64]. It is an electrically small resonator that operates
as an LC tank circuit with a high Q-factor, the equivalent circuit
model for which is shown in Fig. 4. Since the electrical length
of a metamaterial unit cell is much smaller than the wavelength
of the operating wave, the CSRR becomes a useful tool for
miniaturization. Changing the physical size of the CSRR unit
cell changes the L2 and C2 , as given by:
f0 =

1
√
2π L2 C2

(1)

The desired resonant frequency, hence, can be achieved by controlling the L2 and C2 . The layout of a patch antenna loaded
with an optimized CSRR unit cell at 1.2 GHz and its dimensions
are illustrated in Fig. 5. This design layout was achieved after
extensive parametrization, summarized in the next section.
E. Parametric Analysis
In the first attempt, a 50 Ω matched microstrip patch antenna
was designed within a 8.5 × 9.8 mm2 area, which resonated at
4.6 GHz. As shown in Fig. 6(a), no CSRR loading was employed
in this case. Various dimensions of the CSRR were tested at all
the practical locations on the ground plane to see its effects
and changes on the antenna performance. Several combinations
of these geometries together with the resonant frequencies are

same antenna), resulting in different resonant frequencies.

shown in Fig. 6(b)–(h). It should be noted that the substrate
material used in the HFSS simulations was Rogers TMM10i.
Initially, the CSRR was etched exactly below the center of
the patch with the smallest possible dimensions (L1 = 3.5 mm,
W1 = 2.5 mm), that can be milled in house. No significant
frequency shift was observed but it did, however, seem to be
an effective method. Putting the CSRR at the center location,
as shown in the Fig. 6(b), provided maximum flexibility for the
parametrization analysis. In order to better understand the effect
of each parameter on the resonant frequency and miniaturization, let us consider the following cases:
1) Case I—Variations in the widths: The widths W1 and W2
of the CSRR were extended from the center to the maximum value (W ), while keeping all the other parameters
constant. As a result, the resonance frequency got shifted
to the lower band as the width increased but it was not
very effective to achieve a resonance below 3 GHz, as
shown in Fig. 6(d).
2) Case II–Variations in the lengths: Next, the lengths L1
and L2 of the CSRR were increased, while keeping all the
other parameters constant. This method revealed a better
shift in the resonance to the lower band, as frequency as
low as 2.6 GHz was achieved in this case, as shown in
Fig. 6(c).

design, we used Rogers TMM10i substrate with the permittivity εr = 9.8, dissipation factor tanδ = 0.0020, and thickness
t = 1.52 mm. Also, to keep the overall volume of the antenna to
a minimum, a conformal coating was used instead of the superstrate, which did not only insulate the antenna but also helped
in reducing the overall size. Effects of the proposed insulation
layer, (i.e., the conformal coating) were tested experimentally
to observe the changes in the performance of the antenna, but
were found nominal.
Fig. 7. Results of the parametric analysis of the antenna. (a) Variations of the
space (g), and (b) variations of the gap (k) in the CSRR.

3) Case III—Variations in the lengths and widths together:
Following the first two cases, the lengths and widths of the
CSRR were then increased proportionally and found to
be an effective method to achieve a lower resonance. The
maximum practical dimensions of the CSRR, as shown
in Fig. 6(e), helped the antenna resonated at 840 MHz.
The parameter, “g” however played an important role in
achieving a good match at this frequency.
4) Case IV—Variations in the gap, “g”: This was an important parameter in the CSRR unit cell. Fig. 7(a) shows the
results of the implantable antenna with variations of the
gap “g.”
(5) Case V—Variations of the space, “k” in the CSRR: Studying the variations of the space “k,” showed significant
changes in the resonance frequency too. This parameter
was found to be very effective in achieving the required
resonance frequency of 1.2 GHz. A parametric analysis
of “k” is shown in Fig. 7(b).
F. Effects of the Substrate and Insulation
Substrate materials with high-permittivity properties are selected for implantable antennas because they shorten the effective wavelength and result in lower resonance frequencies.
Correct use of the substrate material is, hence, critical in the design of the implantable antenna. Superstrate layers are, however,
used to insulate the implantable antennas from high-permittivity
tissue. The operating frequency is reported to be increased by
the thicker superstrates, which also increase the physical size to
refine the resonance [15]. For implantable antennas, substrates
with high permittivity and superstrates with low thicknesses
are, hence, the preferred choice. Another method to insulate
the antenna is to cover the antenna with a thin layer of lowloss biocompatible coating, as reported in [20] and [72]. In our

IV. RECTENNA DESIGN
A. Rectifier Topology and Efficiency
As shown in Fig. 8, two half wave rectifiers are combined
to make a basic symmetrical voltage multiplier circuit. The
addition of a second diode and a capacitor to the output of a
standard half-wave rectifier increased its output by a set amount.
Since one of the diodes is conducting in each half cycle as in
a full-wave rectifier (FWR) circuit, it hence can also be called
a full-wave series multiplier [73]. The aforementioned rectifier
circuit operates as follows. If v(t) is the induced voltage at the
antenna port and is positive, then C1 charges up through diode
D1 and when v(t) is negative, capacitor C2 charges up through
diode D2 . The output voltage v(out) is taken across the two
series-connected capacitors (C1 and C2 ).
The impedance matching stage, as shown in Fig. 8, is essential in providing maximum power transfer from the antenna to
the rectifier circuit. Since a rectifier is a nonlinear load with
complex impedance that varies with frequency hence, designing the matching network is required. As reported by [74], one
design approach is to model the rectifier circuit using experimental characterization at the minimum power level required
by the application. This can be achieved by measuring the input
impedance of the rectifier circuit without the matching network
at that power level. The results of the rectifier’s input impedance
from the experimental characterization helped in the design of
the matching network for 50 Ω. A simple matching circuit comprising of only one inductor (12 nH) was used between the
antenna and the rectifier. This inductor also served the purpose
of a low-pass filter, allowing RF energy at 1.2 GHz, but rejecting
the unwanted higher order harmonics. Also, the use of this filter
was necessary to stop the radiation of harmonics generated by
the nonlinear diodes, required for the rectification.
Fig. 9 depicts the efficiency η of the full-wave series multiplier
circuit, which was measured using the fabricated prototype. The

experimental setup for measuring the η included two horn antennas (HRN-0118, TDK), each used to transmit and receive the
continuous sinusoidal signal, generated by the Agilent N5181A
(Analog Signal Generator). η was measured as a function of the
input RF power from −10 to 15 dBm and calculated using the
following formula:
η=

PDC
Harvested Power (DC)
=
Input RF Power to the Rectifier
PRF

(2)

For most rectifier circuits, η changes with the RF input power,
impedance matching, operating frequency, and diode properties. In this study, the operating frequency was kept constant at
1.2 GHz, and also two identical diodes were chosen, while the
power was altered to get the efficiency characteristics.
V. PACING AND CHARGING CIRCUIT
A. Pacing Circuit
The asynchronous, nondemand pacing signal was generated using an 8-bit PIC microcontroller, PIC12LF1840 [75],
as shown in Fig. 8. The turn-ON voltage for the microcontroller
was 1.8 V, but it was programmed to remain in the sleep mode
for the first second. The heart rate of a sedated ovine model has
been reported to be 100 bpm [76], so the pacing signal was,
hence, generated at a higher rate to observe the changes in the
cardiac rhythm. In order to test and overdrive the heart, the selected rates were chosen higher than 100 bpm but not too high to
drive the ventricular fibrillation. Measurements of the three sets
of successive, but different paced rhythms, generated during this
study have been shown in Fig. 10, and summarized as follows:
1) Rhythm I—110 bpm: 18 pulses were first generated, as
the PIC paced for 1 ms each time, while went to sleep for
544 ms in each cycle. This resulted in (1/ 0.545)× 60 =
110.1 (≈110) bpm.
2) Rhythm II—120 bpm: Next, 20 pulses were generated,
where the PIC paced for 1 ms, but remained in sleep
mode for 496 ms in each cycle. This combination hence
resulted in (1/ 0.496)× 60 = 120.7 (≈120) bpm.
3) Rhythm III—130 bpm: Finally, 22 pulses were generated, where the PIC paced for 1 ms but slept for 456 ms
in each cycle. This resulted in (1/ 0.456)×60 = 131.3
(≈130) bpm.

Fig. 10. Measured pacing profile showing, (a) a complete pacing cycle including 18, 20, and 22 pulses, (b) two (out of 20) pulses with the time (496 ms)
between them, generating 120 bpm, and (c) profile of a single pulse, its voltage
level (1.7 V) and width (1 ms).

B. Charging Circuit and the Load
Next, the output DC voltage of the rectenna was supplied
to a bulk capacitor Cc , which was placed across the output
of the rectifier circuit and in parallel to the load (which also
contains the microprocessor), as shown in Fig. 8. This capacitor
charges up when the voltage from the rectifier rises above that of
the capacitor and provides the required current from the stored
charge, when the rectifier voltage falls. For a FWR, the ripple
voltage is estimated using, Vripple = Iload / (2f C). This equation
provides sufficient accuracy for our load, which draws only
30 μA [75]. Although, the capacitor discharge behavior for a
purely resistive load is exponential, the inaccuracy introduced
by the linear approximation is very small for low values of the
ripples. The total load of our system is not only the pacing
circuit, but it is the combination of the pacing circuit and the
impedance of the heart tissue. A good approximation of the
impedance of the heart tissue has hence to be determined.
An initial experiment on the heart of an ovine model was
performed to approximate the impedance of the heart tissue. A
100 Ω resistor was connected in series with the heart tissue, using two test probe pins (8 mm apart) inserted at the left ventricle.
Next, a digital signal (amplitude = 1 volt, frequency = 5 KHz)
was supplied to the series connected resistor and the heart tissue and voltages measured. A complete profile of voltage and
current was recorded and finally, a fast Fourier transformation
(FFT) was performed on the recorded signals using Ohm’s law
(f f t(Vheart )/f f t(I100Ω )) to compute the impedance. The f f t

impedance plot showed the spectral contents with 0th harmonic
(real impedance) and other higher order harmonics (imaginary
impedance). The computed values were found to be, R = 665 Ω
and C = 59.3 nF, which was the impedance (approx.) of the
heart tissue during the pacing.
VI. VALIDATION AND FABRICATION OF THE BATTERY-LESS
AND WIRELESS PROTOTYPE IMPLANTABLE ELECTRODE
A. Validation of the Rectenna in HFSS
The implantable antenna designed and discussed in Section
III was integrated with the rectifier circuit, discussed in Section
IV. To accommodate the rectifier and matching circuit on the
same substrate, the overall antenna dimensions were increased
by extending the antenna in the -y axis (direction) and cutting the microstrip feed short. To validate the design, all the
additional components, [i.e., the matching inductor (Lm ), the
diodes (D1 , D2 ), and the capacitors (C1 , C2 )] were simulated
as lumped components in HFSS to minimize the error in measurements. This process incurred a mismatch and also shifted
the resonance frequency to a higher band. It is to be noted that
the size of the radiating patch was not changed and was kept the
same as previously mentioned in Fig. 5. The CSRR parameters
in the ground plane were finally modified to reachieve a good
impedance match at 1.2 GHz. The final layout configuration,
together with the rectifier and matching components has been
illustrated in Fig. 11.
As depicted in Fig. 11(a), two vias (0.2 mm in radius) were
made in pads A and B, to connect the capacitors C1 and C2 ,
respectively to the ground. The rectified output DC voltage was
received between the pads C and D, which eventually was supplied to the pacing circuit (layer 2) beneath the antenna, as
discussed in the Section VI-C.

(substrate) would hence strongly influence the performance of
the antenna and had hence been analyzed prior to its selection.
Various substrates (i.e., TMM4, TMM6, TMM10i, and TMM13i
with different dielectric properties, εr = 4.5, 6.02, 9.8, and 10.2),
respectively were used to study the dielectric loading and results
were compared and analyzed. As shown in Fig. 12, the use of
TMM13i showed good results and was, hence, finally selected
as a substrate for the pacing circuit.
The resonant frequency of the implantable antenna shifted
to a higher band, when it was loaded with a substrate of low
permittivity values but remained unchanged, when loaded with
TMM13i, having εr = 10.2. It was observed that the smaller the
permittivity of the substrate, the higher the shift in the resonance
frequency incurred. As a result, Rogers TMM13i was used for
the pacing circuit fabrication.

C. Prototype Fabrication Approach

As discussed earlier in this section, the pacing circuit had to
be glued directly beneath the antenna, making it a two-layer
design. The dielectric properties of the pacing circuit board

A step-by-step assembly process of the prototype fabrication
approach is shown in Fig. 13(a). As seen in Fig. 13, the rectenna
and the matching circuit were fabricated on layer 1, which sat

atop layer 2, containing the pacing circuit and the charging capacitor Cc . As depicted in the Fig. 13(a)–(c), the rectified DC
voltage was supplied to the bottom of layer 2, to the charging capacitor, and to supply power to the pacing circuit. Layers 1 and 2
were eventually bonded together using super glue (Loctite). Finally, the back probe pins were soldered in place to the output of
the pacing circuit and tips sharpened for easy implantation. The
assembled electrode, as shown in Fig. 13(c), was then secured in
the 3-D printed enclosure, insulated using a conformal coating,
and allowed to dry at room temperature. Various parts of the
prototype electrode and a complete manufactured electrode is
shown in Fig. 14.
The rectenna as well as the pacing circuit was fabricated using the LPKF milling maching (Protomat S63) on TMM10i and
TMM13i, respectively. The 3-D printed enclosure, which houses
the antenna and the pacing circuit was designed in Solidworks
and printed in house. Details of all the components of the manufactured prototype wireless electrode are shown in Table II.
D. In Vitro Measurements and Results
The final version of the insulated implanted antenna (only,
i.e., without the rectifier circuit) was tested in a porcine tissue. All measurements were taken using a calibrated Agilent
E5071C ENA Network Analyzer, in an anechoic chamber. The

measured return loss was compared with the simulations and
found in good agreement, as shown in Fig. 15(a). HFSS simulations showed a return loss of −26 dB at 1.2 GHz, while the
measured return loss was −17 dB at 1.25 GHz, which showed
agreement within 1.04%. Also, simulated and measured normalized radiation patterns in xz (H)- and yz (E)-planes have been
presented in Fig. 15(b) and (c), which showed good agreement.
Furthermore, the simulated actual maximum gain and simulated
realized gain of the proposed antenna was 0.58 and 0.53 dBi, but
the measured realized gain was −1.5 dBi. The slight frequency
shift was attributed in part to the fabrication imperfection associated with the resolution of the milling machine and to the
difference in electrical properties of the tissue.
VII. MEASUREMENT AND In Vivo SURGERIES
To explore how using the ovine subject would affect the performance of the prototype wireless electrode in the human body,
collaboration was developed with the Animal Nutrition & Physiology Center (ANPC), North Dakota State University. The in
vivo measurements were performed in two models, 8 and 4
year old adult of dorset breed. The models weighed 129 and
143 lbs, respectively. Dorset models are often used as research
subjects as their cardiac activity and especially the coronory
anatomy of their hearts are similar to the anatomy of the human
heart. They hence have been a preferred choice for research in
the HF treatment [77]. All the surgical procedures and in vivo
measurements were carried out in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol (No. A15028).
For long-term in vivo studies, the implantable systems need
be enclosed in a medical-grade biocompatible material but a
toulene and xylene free conformal coating was used to insulate
the implantable electrode in this short-term acute animal study.

Fig. 16. Layout of the in vivo experiment setup and RF energy transmission
method with exterior system. Details of the equipment used in the exterior
system are: 1 - Horn antenna = TDK-HRN-0118, 2 - Power amplifier = MiniCircuits (ZHL-30W-252-S+), and 3 - Analog signal source = Agilent-N5181A.

A complete blood count and metabolic panel was conducted
and examined before the animal was declared fit and suitable
to be used for the study. During the surgery, a combination of
IV Ketamine (5 mg/kg) and Valium (0.25 mg/kg) were used
for the anesthetic induction. In each experiment, the sheep
was intubated, with an endotracheal tube and maintained under
the anesthesia with Isoflurane (0–5%) under positive ventilation. The sheep was continuously monitored to assure surgical
plane of anesthesia by heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory
rate, O2 saturation, and capnometry (exhaled CO2 levels) at
35–45 mmHg as well as jaw tone, ocular, and palpebral reflexes.
Following adequate general anesthesia, the ovine subject was
positioned in the right lateral decubitus (recumbency) position
and an antero-lateral left thoracotomy was performed. To gain
access to the left thorax, the extremities were positioned and held
in place using rope. The left chest was shaved with a no. 40 clipper blade and three alternating scrubs using betadine followed
by an alcohol rinse were used to prep the surgical site. After site
preparation, surgical drapes and lighting were setup and incandescent lights were used to maintain the body temperature.
For in vivo studies, our experimental and surgical setup,
shown in Fig. 16, consists of the ovine test subject, horn antenna, power amplifier, signal generator, and a voltmeter. The
implantation of our wireless electrode began with the incision
made on the front and left side of the chest of the selected model.
The incision was carried down to the ribs using a muscle splitting technique and the seventh interspace was entered into the
pleural space. Next, the pericardium was incised vertically and
the heart was delivered into the pleural space, taking care not
to compromise venous return. Cautery was disconnected at this
time to avoid damage to the electrode once it was implanted.
The heart was examined and a clear area was located to the
left of the LAD (left anterior descending coronary artery), on the
epicardial surface of the left ventricle. This flat area above the
apex was selected to insert the electrode pins directly into the
myocardium. Two previously placed nonconductive pledgeted
prolene 5–0 sutures were placed through small plastic loops, located on the sides of the electrode’s enclosure for stabilization.
Instrumentation wires from the electrode were gently brought

through the medial aspect of the thoracotomy to monitor the rectified voltage harvested by the implanted electrode, as shown in
Fig. 17. Once the electrode was implanted and secured, a rib approximator was used to complete the cardiothoracic procedure
and the chest was sealed with a vicryl (Ethicon, Inc.) suture.
VIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The results from the in vivo studies validated the ability of the
wireless electrode, implanted deep inside the body of the model
to receive the RF energy and harvest it to provide enough power
for the microprocessor to provide pacing. As shown in the layout
(see Fig. 16), the horn antenna was placed approximately 25 cm
above the thorax and supplied the RF energy to the implanted
pacemaker. The distance of 25 cm was the maximum allowed
to power and interrogate the implant under the safe level of RF
exposure, as summarized in [78]. In our in vivo studies, pacing
at three different rates, 110, 120, and 130 bpm were achieved
and demonstrated. These results were measured live and saved
using a six lead ECG module connected to the ovine model
during the course of the experiment. Some results are shown
in Fig. 18. IEEE limits for the maximum permissible exposure
(MPE) in the controlled environment [78] were followed and
the safe power density at the operating frequency of 1.2 GHz
was computed as, 1200 MHz/1500 = 0.8 mW/cm2 .
In our experimental setup, the power density S, incident on
the surface of the thorax was computed using the following
formula [79]:
S =

Gt Pt
4πR2

(3)

Gt (= 6.5 dBi) was the gain of the horn antenna at 1.2 GHz,
while Pt (= 10 dBm) was the approximate power transmitted
from the horn, which also included the gain of the power amplifier. R was the distance between the horn and the thorax,
which was measured to be 25 cm (approx). The power density
using these values was computed to be 0.0082 mW/cm2 , which
was well under the required safe level, and, hence met the MPE
specifications.

Energy transmission using a horn antenna, held on the top of
a subject might not seem practical, but the aim of this study was
to prove the concept of the wireless energy transfer in vivo and
the feasibility of wireless cardiac pacing. It is envisioned that
the clinical use of our system will require: (a) a wearable battery
operated transmitter system with a miniaturized conformal antenna, and (b) a miniaturized cylindrical-shaped biocompatible
electrode that can be fully inserted into the myocardium. Furthermore, the operation frequency of 1.2 GHz was used because
a set of preliminary experiments indicated that this frequency
produced good propagation through the tissue and also, this frequency matched efficient performance of the available Schottky
diodes, which resulted in a more efficient rectifier circuit.
IX. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper considers the problem of leads and batteries required for the conventional cardiac pacemakers and presents
the design and in vivo test of a batteryless and fully wireless
implantable asynchronous cardiac pacemaker. The prototype
implanted electrode has been successfully tested on the left ventricle of an ovine model. It is shown that a small implanted pacemaker can be wirelessly powered using an external RF source
and can provide leadless pacing. Pacing at three different rates
(110, 120, 130 bpm) has been achieved and demonstrated in
this study. This proposed RF powered wireless cardiac system
employs a unique technique, which completely eliminates the
use of the leads and batteries in cardiac pacing. This method
provides a new frontier of research in wireless cardiac pacing,
which may be extended to other areas in the wireless biomedical
sensors. Once clinically proven, this technology has the potential to allow multiple electrodes to be implanted in the heart,
without the need for any leads or batteries.
Future study will include further miniaturization, and also
the design and test of the electrode for Industrial, Scientific, and
Medical bands. Moreover, we will investigate the efficiency of
