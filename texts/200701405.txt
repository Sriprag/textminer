Abstract
The original Lotka’s Law refers to single scientist distribution, i.e. the frequency of authors Ai with i publications per author is
a function of i: Ai = f(i). However, with increasing collaboration in science and in technology the study of the frequency of pairs or
triples of co-authors is highly relevant. Starting with pair distribution well-ordered collaboration structures of co-author pairs will be
presented, i.e. the frequency of co-author pairs Nij between authors with i publications per author and authors with j publications per
author is a function of i and j: Nij = f(i, j) using the normal count procedure for counting i or j. We have assumed that the distribution of
co-author pairs’ frequencies can be considered to be reflection of a social Gestalt and therefore can be described by the corresponding
mathematical function based on well-known general characteristics of structures in interpersonal relations in social networks. We
have shown that this model of social Gestalts can better explain the distribution of co-author pairs than by a simple bivariate function
in analogy to Lotka’s Law. This model is based on both the Gestalt theory and the old Chinese Yin/Yang theory.

1. Introduction
1.1. First remarks
Since several decades, collaboration is increasing in science and in technology. Usually, the bibliometric method for
the study of collaboration is the investigation of co-authorships (de B. Beaver, 2001; de Solla Price, 1963; Glänzel, 2002;
Glänzel & de Lange, 1997; Glänzel & Schubert, 2004; Luukkonen, Persson, & Silvertse, 1992; Miquel & Okubo, 1994;
Newman, 2001; Okubo, Miquel, Frigoletto, & Doré, 1992; Tijssen & Moed, 1989; Zitt, Bassecoulard, & Okubo, 2000).
The original Lotka’s Law (Lotka, 1926) refers to single scientist distribution, i.e. the frequency of authors Ai with i
publications per author is a function of i:
Ai = f (i)

(1)

However, with increasing collaboration in science and in technology the study of the frequency of pairs or triples of
co-authors is highly relevant. Starting with pair distribution the frequency of co-author pairs Nij between authors with
i publications per author and authors with j publications per author is a function of i and j:
Nij = f (i, j)

Whereas regarding Lotka’s Law single scientists P distribution (both in single authored and in multi-authored
bibliographies) is of interest, in the future pairs P, Q distribution, triples P, Q, R distribution, etc., should be considered.
Starting with pair distribution, the following questions arise in the present paper:
- Is there any regularity for the distribution of co-author pairs’ frequencies?
- If yes, can the distribution of co-author pairs be described by an extension of Lotka’s Law or can this distribution be
better described by a model of social Gestalts?
Regarding the last question, two theoretical distributions will be calculated and these distributions will be further
specified and discussed in the next sections.
However, in Section 1 we only intend to visualize the two theoretical distributions in comparison with an empirical
distribution.
1.2. Is there any regularity for the distribution of co-author pairs’ frequencies?
For visualization, Lotka’s distribution and co-authorship distribution of pairs of collaborators obtained from the
journal Science are presented in Fig. 1. The articles from 1980 to 1998 of the journal Science were studied with 47,117
authors and the total sum of Nij = 418,458 co-author pairs (method for counting Nij , cf. below).
Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the number of authors Ai with i publications per author (upper row) contrasted with
the distribution of the number of co-author pairs Nij between authors with i publications per author and authors with j
publications per author (lower row). For clarity’s sake and optimum visualization the presentation of data are restricted
to authors with at most 10 articles i (i = 1, 2, . . ., 10) or j (j = 1, 2, . . ., 10) respectively.
The upper row reflects the Lotka’s Law. In this row, the distribution of the number of authors Ai with i publications per
author is given on the left, and on the right the corresponding double logarithmic presentation. Ai (or log Ai respectively)
is plotted at the Y-axis and i (or log i respectively) is plotted at the X-axis.
In the lower row, the distribution of the number of co-author pairs Nij is given on the left, and the corresponding
triple logarithmic presentation on the right. The number of pairs Nij (or log Nij respectively) is plotted at the Z-axis, i
(or log i respectively) is plotted at the X-axis and j (or log j respectively) is plotted at the Y-axis.
Fig. 1 has shown we can say yes to the first question that there is any regularity existing for the distribution of
co-author pairs’ frequencies.

However, before considering the second question regarding the description of the distribution of co-author pairs’
frequencies [Nij = f(i, j)] information about the method of counting these co-author pairs is necessary.
Method for counting Ni and Nij (in extended form, cf. Appendix A): Given is an artificial bibliography including
eight papers (names of authors: A, B, . . .).

The number of publications i (or j respectively) per author P (or Q respectively) is determined by resorting to the
“normal count procedure”. Each time the name of an author appears, it is counted (e.g. A three times: once in the first
paper, and once each in the 4th and 8th papers).
Pairs P, Q are marked in the cells of the matrix under the condition of both the first authors P count (i) and the
second authors Q count (j), i.e. the authors are ordered according to i or j respectively in both the row and the column
(cf. Table 1).
Under the condition, the place of the authors in the by-line is not taken into consideration the symmetrical matrix
is resulting. For example, the pair G, A is marked two times: once under the condition G count (i) and A count (j) and
once under the condition A count (i) and G count (j).
In the symmetrical matrix, one can determine for each author P the number of his collaborators NP . NP is equal to
the Degree Centrality in Social Network Analysis (SNA).
The matrix of Nij (Table 2, derived from the symmetrical matrix) is the representation of the number of pairs Nij
with authors who have i publications per author, with authors who have j publications per author included in the
bibliography.
For example, the pairs E, D and F, D in Table 1 are counted both as N12 = 2 and N21 = 2 in the matrix of Nij .

1.3. Can the distribution of co-author pair’s frequencies be better described by a model of social Gestalts than by
the extension of Lotka’s Law?
As mentioned above in Section 1 we only intend to visualize both the theoretical pattern derived from the extension
of Lotka’s Law and the theoretical pattern of social Gestalt in comparison with the empirical distribution obtained from
the journal Science.
Fig. 2 shows the comparison of the empirical distribution of log Nij with the two different distributions of theoretical
values. The figures on the right are rotated by 90◦ .
The empirical distribution of the pairs’ frequencies in Science (Fig. 2, second row) is rather equal to the theoretical
distribution of social Gestalts (third row) but different from the other, i.e. from the pattern by the extension of Lotka’s
Law (first row).

This is the first proof for the assumption the distribution of the co-author pairs’ frequencies Nij can be considered
to be a social Gestalt. It is the key phrase of this paper stating a key result and it constitutes the principal method and
the main point of the paper.
Both the extension of Lotka’s Law and the meaning of Gestalt will be explained in the next sections followed by
the mathematical function for the description of social Gestalts. This general theoretical function is valid for different
kinds of social Gestalts. We will give the proof that the distribution of co-author pairs’ frequencies is one example of
them. Four journals are studied.
For thorough explanation of the theoretical and methodological background of the studies in this paper, in most of
the sections or paragraphs reference is given to the corresponding information in the annex.
2. Theoretical bivariate distribution derived from the extension of Lotka’s Law
Qin (1995) showed in her example, that the number of collaborators Ni is distributed in the same way as the total
number of publications of all authors with i publications per author (Ti ):
Ti = iAi

(3)

This means, that the marginal sums Ni (or Nj respectively) should be distributed according to an inverse power
function in line with Lotka’s Law, however, with a different parameter:


constant
constant
or Nj =
Ni =
respectively
(4)
ia
ja
Because of the symmetry of the matrix, both the distributions of the marginal sums of the matrix are equal
(row = column).
Assuming the condition, that the productivity of the authors has no social influence whatsoever, which author
collaborates with which other author, the distribution of the number of pairs could be determined within the matrix
solely on the basis of the marginal sums:
Ni Nj
Nij = 
i Ni

(5)

Under the condition the formula (4) is valid there could be a relationship in (5) with Lotka’s Law and the distribution
of the number of pairs could be formulated as follows:
constant
Nij =
(6)
(ij)a
and
log Nij = constant + a(log i + log j)

(7)

This theoretical distribution (7) is shown in the first row of Fig. 2. While the double logarithmic presentation of
Lotka’s Law is a straight line, the triple logarithmic extension resembles a plane surface (extension of Lotka’s Law).
3. Gestalt theory/psychology
3.1. General remarks
In the wake of a tangible change of paradigm in science occuring by the end of the 20th century, a number of holistic
theories have emerged (e.g. Bohm, 1980; Laszlo, 1997; Prigogine & Stengers, 1984; Sheldrake, 1988; Stapp, 1993,
etc., just to mention only a few of them) which are operating on the idea of holographic interacting entities in the world,
with several of them also implying a ﬁeld concept.
For example:
- magnetic field in physics,
- morphogenetic field of living organisms in evolutionary biology,
- psychological fields in psychology or sociology (Gestalts), etc.

H. Kretschmer, T. Kretschmer / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 308–337

313

According to Pribram (1997, p. 12) field concepts are being used as long as remote-field effects have to be
explained.
The ﬁeld concept says a force, which emanates from a ﬁeld generates a balanced evenness among all the individual
components in their totality.
In psychology the specialty “Gestalt” psychology had originated at the end of the 19th century with due consideration
of psychological processes, with holistic organizational patterns playing a role that comprised man and the environment.
These holistic entities are often designated as psychological fields. Their tendency towards a stable state of order is
called conciseness (or “Prägnanz”) tendency, it is a “tendency towards a good Gestalt”. The stable final state is, if
possible, built up in a simple, well-ordered, harmonic and uniform manner in line with definite rules. Several authors
take the view that these ﬁelds can be mathematically described.
In the next paragraphs of this section:
- a rather new model of social Gestalts or behavioural fields is presented;
- as well as the illustration of the main idea with help of an example;
- beyond the main idea two further aspects of social Gestalts are explained as basis for the studies of co-author pairs’
frequencies (varying shapes of social Gestalts and overlapping of social Gestalts).
3.2. Theoretical model of social “Gestalts” or behavioural ﬁelds
3.2.1. Overview
The rather new theoretical model of social “Gestalts” or behavioural ﬁelds (Kretschmer, 1999a, 2002) is intended
to suggest that
* social interactions between a large number of individual persons;
* could be mirrored in the form of well-ordered three-dimensional Gestalts (fields) in dependence upon
* the characteristics of these individual persons (general characteristics in interpersonal relations in social networks:
cf. Appendix E).
Examples (types) of social interactions are collaboration, friendships, marriages, etc., while examples (types) of
characteristics of these individual persons are age, labor productivity, education, professional status, etc.
Because of the general validity of this model in social networks:
- social Gestalts can emerge independently on the types of characteristics of persons and interaction (illustration, cf.
Appendix B);
- social Gestalts can emerge independently on the used statistical methods of interaction measurement (illustration,
cf. Appendix C) or personality characteristics.
Thus, we intend to investigate whether the distribution of co-author pairs’ frequencies can be considered to be a
social Gestalt because co-authorships are the reflections of interactions and the scientific productivity can be considered as characteristic of persons. A large number of individual persons are studied with the help of bibliometric
data.
Under the condition we can give the corresponding proof for the social Gestalt then distributions of co-author
pairs’ frequencies can be described by the mathematical function derived for the social Gestalts in social networks
(Kretschmer, 2002 and Appendix F).
Whereas the principal points of the mathematical function will be explained in the next section in the present section,
we illustrate the main idea of the theoretical model.
3.2.2. Illustration of the main idea of the theoretical model of social Gestalts in correspondence with Gestalt
theory
- A force that emanates from the well-ordered pattern of the whole (social or behavioural Gestalt) acts on the individual
components (individual persons) of this whole.

Fig. 3. Social Gestalt in the Timetables of Science (Hellemans & Bunch 1998) and in the Timetables of History (Grun, 1975)—X, Y: age (1: 21–30,
2: 31–40, 3: 41–50, 4: 51–60, 5: 61–70) and Z = HXY : communication/collaboration.

- Even if this force fails to determine completely an individual component in terms of the predictability of this individual
component:
* this force, nevertheless, generates a statistically balanced evenness among all the individual components in their
totality in the sense of a well-ordered pattern (according Gestalt theory: “Tendency towards a good social Gestalt”);
* suggesting that this Gestalt will become predictable within a very high margin of probability.
An example, most suitable for illustration of the main idea is shown in Fig. 3 although the shape of this special
social Gestalt is very different from the shape of the distribution of co-author pairs’ frequencies (Fig. 3 is a copy of a
part of Fig. 1 on p. 450 in Kretschmer, Liang, & Kundra, 2001). Explanation about varying shapes of social Gestalts
will be delivered in one of the next paragraphs of this section.
The idea of this example in Fig. 3 is connected especially with Liang Liming (Kretschmer et al., 2001). Whereas the
ages of the scientists and artists which have been accomplished in collaboration/communication have to be plotted on the
first (X) and second (Y) dimension the homophylic indices have to be plotted on the third (HXY ) dimension of the figure.
The homophylic index was calculated as a ratio between the observed to the statistically expected values on the condition
that the joint collaboration/communication was independent of the age (Homophylic index HXY , cf. Appendix D).
There is a wide range of reasons for addressing individual cases or components, i.e. how is it explainable that
especially the two scientists Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner, almost of identical age, had jointly succeeded in discovering
protactinium and uranium, or why the 31-year-old Pascal and the 53-year-old de Fermat had jointly provided the
foundations for the probability calculus. Every collaboration has its own history, even books had been written about
many of them, for instance about the 25-year-old Watson and the 37-year-old Crick who jointly succeeded in determining
the exact build-up of DNA. That means – as mentioned above – the force that emanates from the well-ordered pattern
of the whole (social Gestalt) fails to determine completely an individual component part in terms of the predictability
of this individual component.
However, in spite of the popular acclaim and the specific aspects relating to individual events the force of the wellordered Gestalt for the whole has demonstrably generated a statistically balanced evenness for the individual events,
indicating that a mathematically describable Gestalt can be envisioned (cf. Fig. 3).
In correspondence, we can expect the tendency towards a “Good Gestalt” is increasing with increasing number of
individual components. That means large sample sizes should be preferred for studies. Furthermore, for the proof of
social Gestalts an additional phenomenon of Gestalts should be taken into consideration originally related to morphogenetic fields or morphogenetic Gestalts: Overlapping or mixing of social Gestalts in analogy to overlapping of faces.

H. Kretschmer, T. Kretschmer / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 308–337

315

3.2.3. Overlapping of individual social Gestalts in analogy to overlapping of faces
In former studies (Kretschmer, 1999b) could be shown that the “Tendency towards a good gestalt” will enhance with
the rising number of mixed social Gestalts (cf. Fig. 4, this figure is a copy of a part of Fig. 3 on p. 511 in Kretschmer,
1999a).
This phenomenon is in correspondence with superimpositions or overlappings of facial contours which have been
made in a number of cases. Fischer, reported in 1997 that Sir Francis Galton, the English natural scientist and
anthropologist had tried already in 1878 to identify the typical countenance of a law-breaker.
In each of these experiments it was surprisingly revealed – independently of who had performed them – that the result
of the superimposedly mixed or average faces was more attractive than the individual ones and that these mixed faces
became the more attractive, the greater was the number of overlappings. The “more attractive” faces were considered
more well-ordered and harmonic and generally more proportional.
This is in correspondence with Gestalt theory, i.e. with the “tendency towards a good Gestalt”. Although the force
that emanates from the well-ordered Gestalt of a face fails to determine completely an individual face in terms of the
predictability of this individual face this force, nevertheless, generates a statistically balanced evenness among all the
individual faces in their totality. Thus, in empirical studies with increasing number of individual social Gestalts the
mixed pattern is more even than the individuals.
That tendency is independent of the kind of Gestalts, morphogenetic (faces) or psychological or social or others.
Therefore, it is tested in one of the next sections whether the empirical distribution of the co-author pairs’ frequencies of the mixed four distributions is of higher similarity to the corresponding well-ordered Gestalt than the single
distributions per se.

Fig. 4. Social Gestalts in the co-authorship networks of medicine; X, Y: productivity of scientists and Z: relative frequency of co-authorships. The
mixed or average pattern in the middle is more even than the individual patterns around (this figure is a copy of a part of Fig. 3 on p. 511 in
Kretschmer, 1999a).

316

H. Kretschmer, T. Kretschmer / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 308–337

However, what does it mean that the shapes of the social Gestalts in Fig. 3 and in the middle of Fig. 4 are looking
different from each other?
3.2.4. Shapes of social Gestalts
Based on the influence of the changes of men and environment these social Gestalts can change the shape
resulting in a diversity of social Gestalts. Explanation will be given in the next section. These many Gestalts are
classified into prototypes in the sense of well-ordered patterns or “Good Gestalts” (Fig. 5). The Gestalt in Fig. 3
is similar to the prototype in the middle of Fig. 5 and the mixed Gestalt in Fig. 4 is similar to the right prototype.
An example for changing the Gestalt of co-authorship networks from one of the prototypes to another one – based
on the influence of the changing research conditions – could be shown by Kretschmer et al. (2001) when studying the
co-authorship network of Indian medicine in the course of about 30 years, Fig. 6. Whereas the left pattern in the third
row of Fig. 6 is similar to the left prototype in the second row of Fig. 5: the right pattern in the third row of Fig. 6 is
similar to the prototype in the middle of Fig. 5, i.e. there is a change of the shape of Gestalts from one of the prototypes
to another one.
Additionally – and independent from considering the change of the shapes – turning the distribution of co-author
pairs (Fig. 1, lower row on the left) around 90◦ we can find a shape of Gestalt similar to the left prototype in the second
row of Fig. 5.
It is interesting to study in future whether we can find any change of the Gestalts of the distribution of co-author
pairs’ frequencies during several decades.
Additionally, the shape can depend on the used statistical methods of interaction measurement (illustration, cf.
Appendix C), on the measurement of personality characteristics or on the methods of presentation as follows: a social
Gestalt (field) is existing in the reality independent on our scientific methods we are using for visualization of this
Gestalt. The results of different kinds of methods are different kinds of reflections of the real Gestalt. For example,
different kinds of mirrors can reflect our man body in different shapes, even rather distorted.

rows) is rotate by 90◦ .

4. Mathematical function for the description of social Gestalts (derivation in detail: cf. Appendices E and F)
4.1. Remarks
The development of the mathematical function is based on both the old Chinese Yin/Yang theory and well-known general characteristics of structures in interpersonal relations in social networks (Kretschmer, 1999a, 2002 and Appendix
E). These general characteristics of social structures are already partly identifiable in groups of higher vertebrates.
One of these general characteristics of structures is well-known as proverb: “Birds of a feather flock together”. It
means in the example of co-authorship networks there are a higher number of co-author pairs Nij than expected with
similar productivity of the co-authors (i ∼ j).

318

H. Kretschmer, T. Kretschmer / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 308–337

We have mentioned earlier in (2):
Nij = f (i, j)
Nij is plotted at the Z-axis, i at the X-axis and j at the Y-axis.
In the general case, we can say regarding social Gestalts:
Z = F (X, Y )

(8)

Z is value of social interactions, and X and Y are values of different persons of a special personality characteristic.
However, there is also another general characteristic of structures in interpersonal relations: “Opposites attract”.
Both opposing proverbs above give rise to reflect on the notion of complementarity (e.g. also particle/wave by Niels
Bohr).
The modern notion of complementarity had existed already in a clear-cut manner in old Chinese thought, in the
Yin/Yang Theory.
Yin and Yang have to be seen as polar forces, as complementary tendencies interacting dynamically with each other,
so that the entire system is kept flexible and open to change.
For example, in social networks Yin can be considered as dissimilarity (A) and Yang as similarity (ACOMPLEMENT )
of persons in social networks.
4.2. Theoretical two-dimensional patterns
For demonstration how the two polar forces are interacting as complementary tendencies dynamically with each
other, so that the entire system is kept flexible and open to change let us have a view at the next figure (Fig. 7). The
patterns of this figure are produced by a systematic variation of the two parameters (α and β) of the following function
(9) (explanation for selecting this kind of function can be found in Appendix F).
This function is the product of both the power function of the dissimilarity and the power function of the complement
(similarity):
Z∗ = f (X, Y ) = constant (A + 1)α (ACOMPLEMENT + 1)β
Dissimilarity :
Similarity :

A = |X − Y |
ACOMPLEMENT = |X − Y |max + |X − Y |min − |X − Y |

(9)
(10)
(11)

the function (9).

H. Kretschmer, T. Kretschmer / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 308–337

319

In every box of Fig. 7 the difference |X − Y| is always the abscissa and Z* the ordinate axis. In the middle of the
abscissa is X − Y = 0. The relationships of the two parameters to each other determine the expressions of Yin and Yang
in each of the patterns.
Fig. 7 shows only eight patterns as typical examples. However, according to Chinese philosophy, Yin and Yang are
the opposite poles of a single whole. There is not an isolated exclusive Yin, or only a Yang. All transitions occur with
a direct and uninterrupted sequence. The natural order is secured by the dynamic equilibrium between Yin and Yang.
That means, theoretically an infinite number of patterns should have been produced in Fig. 7 for presentation of all of
the possible patterns.
For explanation, we intend to characterise four types of similar patterns only:
-

the Yang pattern (upper pattern),
the Yin-in-Yang pattern (left pattern),
the Yin pattern (pattern below), and
the Yang-in-Yin pattern (right pattern).

While in the upper pattern Yang is more likely to be in the foreground (birds of the feather flock together), the
pattern below reveals that Yin is more likely to be accentuated (Opposites attract).
Starting from the left side of the upper pattern in the direction of the pattern below from pattern to pattern Yang has
retracted itself in favour of Yin.
Vice versa, starting from the right side of the pattern below in the direction of the upper pattern from pattern to
pattern Yin has retracted itself in favour of Yang.
4.3. Empirical two-dimensional patterns
Thirty-two empirical patterns could be found matching rather all of these theoretical patterns in Fig. 7 (Kretschmer,
1999a, Fig. 3, p. 511). Patterns of co-authorship networks in institutions are similar to the patterns of the lower half in
Fig. 7 (“Opposites attract”) and patterns of co-authorship networks in “Invisible Colleges” are similar to the patterns
of the upper half in Fig. 7 (“Birds of a feather flock together”).
4.4. Theoretical three-dimensional patterns
Because of the existing general structures in social networks, we have extended our visualization up to two different
Yin/Yang pairs.
In the first pair, Yin was considered as dissimilarity (A) and Yang as similarity (ACOMPLEMENT ).
But in the second pair, Yin can be considered as low mixed value (B) and Yang as high mixed value (BCOMPLEMENT )
of a special personality characteristic.
In analogy to the first Yin/Yang pair, we define:
B =X+Y

(12)

BCOMPLEMENT = (X + Y )max + (X + Y )min − (X + Y )

(13)

Z∗∗ = (B + 1)γ (BCOMPLEMENT + 1)δ

(14)

and

We have to mention there is a difference of the patterns resulting from Z* in Fig. 7 and the patterns resulting from
Z** .
Because of the absolute values A = |X − Y|, symmetrical patterns are shown in Fig. 7 but non-symmetrical patterns
emerge according to the function Z** . These non-symmetrical patterns are looking like the patterns in Fig. 7 under the
condition the left parts of each of these patterns are deleted.
One of the well-known general characteristics of structures in interpersonal relations in social networks is called
“edge effect” (U-curve) and the meaning is explained in Appendix E. While the U-curve is equal to a Yin-in-Yang

pattern the reversed U-curve is equal to a Yang-in-Yin pattern. We have explained an example of the edge effect, related
to the main diagonal of the matrix ZXY in Appendix F.3.
It is conclusively consistent with all above considerations to seek a simple mathematical function (conciseness
principle) for the description of a social Gestalt (Kretschmer, 2002). Thus, we have combined function Z* and function
Z** :
Z = f (X, Y ) = constant Z∗ Z∗∗

The diversity of behavioural Gestalts is expressed by the variation of the four parameters of this function, with
the diversity being dependent upon the conditions influencing these Gestalts (e.g. men and environment or statistical
methods of interaction measurement, etc.). Prototypes of these social Gestalts are already presented in Fig. 5.
The expressions of Yin or Yang in both of the Yin/Yang pairs of each of the prototypes are presented in Table 3.
4.5. Empirical three-dimensional patterns
The social Gestalts in co-authorship networks, which are widely spread over the entire world, are obviously real
objects that owe their shape to the balancing interaction of forces, namely to the dynamic equilibriums interacting
between Yin and Yang in the sense of ancient Chinese philosophy. Thus, several empirical social Gestalts matching
the five prototypes were taken out and presented in Kretschmer (2002).
5. Hypotheses
We have shown the derivation of a function with four parameters and one constant for describing social or behavioural
Gestalts in general (16).
For definition of hypotheses regarding the example of co-author pairs’ frequencies Nij , we have to specify the
variables for the study of this kind of social Gestalts.
There is a conjecture by de Solla Price (1963), physicist and science historian, that the logarithm of the number of
publications is of a higher degree of importance than the number of publications per se.
Thus, using the logarithm of the number of publications (log i or log j respectively) as personal characteristic
“productivity”, we define:
X = log i

(17)

Y = log j

(18)

A = | log i − log j|

(19)

B = log i + log j

(20)

Amin = |X − Y |min = | log 1 − log 1| = 0

(21)

Amax = |X − Y |max = |(log i)max − log 1| = | log 1 − (log j)max | = (log i)max = (log j)max

(22)

Bmin = (X + Y )min = log 1 + log 1 = 0

(23)

Thus:

H. Kretschmer, T. Kretschmer / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 308–337

Bmax = (X + Y )max = (log i)max + (log j)max = 2(log i)max = 2(log j)max

321

(24)

Let us lay down a specific value for the maximum possible number of publications i (or j respectively) of an author
as standard for such studies, which does not vary depending upon the given sample. It is assumed that the maximum
possible number of publications of an author is equal to 1000, i.e.
Amax = log 1000 = 3

(25)

Bmax = 2Amax = 6

(26)

Following:
ACOMPLEMENT = 3 − | log i − log j|

(27)

BCOMPLEMENT = 6 − (log i + log j)

(28)

The theoretical mathematical function for describing the social Gestalts of the distribution of co-author pairs’
frequencies is resulting:
Nij = constant (| log i − log j| + 1)α (4 − | log i − log j|)β (log i + log j + 1)γ (7 − log i − log j)δ

(29)

Based on this function, three hypotheses are tested in this paper:
1. The distribution of the frequencies of co-author pairs Nij can be considered to be the reflection of a social Gestalt
with X = log i, Y = log j, and Z = Nij representing a prototype with the expression of Yang in the first Yin/Yang pair
and the expression of Yin in the second. The first proof of this assumption was already given by visualization in
Section 1. The second proof of this assumption will follow by regression analysis.
2. In relation to the phenomenon of overlapping of facial contours, we expect the “Tendency towards a good gestalt”
will enhance with mixing of the four distributions obtained from four different journals.
3. The distribution of co-author pairs’ frequencies Nij can be better described by a model of social Gestalts than by an
extension of Lotka’s Law.
6. Data
Articles of the following journals are studied from 1980–1998:
-

of the journal Science with 47,117 authors and the total sum of Nij = 418,458 co-author pairs;
of the journal Nature with 52,838 authors and the total sum of Nij = 581,698 co-author pairs;
of the journal Proc Natl Acad Sci USA with 79,877 authors and the total sum of Nij = 704,032 co-author pairs;
of the journal Phys Rev B Condensed Matter with 46,232 authors and the total sum of Nij = 544,006 co-author pairs.

7. Methods and results
7.1. Remarks
The methods for counting Ni and Nij are already presented in Section 1 as well as in Appendix A in extended form.
The first proof for the assumption that the distribution of co-author pairs’ frequencies can be considered to be a
social Gestalt is given by visualization in Fig. 2 of Section 1. In this connection, the first proof is also given for the
assumption the distribution of co-author pair’s frequencies can be better described by a model of social Gestalts than
by a simple bivariate function in analogy to Lotka’s Law (extension of Lotka’s law).
7.2. Second proof for the assumption that the distribution of co-author pairs’ frequencies can be considered to be
a social Gestalt
This second proof has to be given by regression analysis.

Fig. 2 has shown the distribution of the frequency of co-author pairs Nij . For clarity’s sake and optimum visualization
the presentation was restricted to authors with at most ten articles i (i = 1, 2, . . ., 10) or j (j = 1, 2, . . ., 10), respectively.
We want to continue this procedure also in using regression analysis in the following three steps.
The empirical distributions of Nij are considered
- under the condition (Cut 10) the data were cut off after i = 10;
- under the condition (Cut 15) of cut off after i = 15 (in the average about 99% of the authors are included);
- under the condition (Cut 31) of cut off after i = 31 (only a very few of the highest productive authors are not included).
Under the condition of logarithmic presentation after regression analysis, the correlations R between theoretical
and empirical values of log Nij and the F-ratios could be found for the four journals (Table 4).
In all of the four journals, both the correlations and the F-ratios are decreasing from Cut 10 in the direction to Cut
31. We assume this decrease is caused by decreasing frequencies of pairs Nij with increasing i and j. As mentioned
above there are two options for testing this assumption:
- In correspondence with the main idea of the theoretical model of social Gestalts (cf. Section 3.2.2), we can expect
the tendency towards a “Good Gestalt” is increasing with increasing number of individual components. That means
larger sample sizes with higher co-author pairs’ frequencies should be preferred for studies.
- Furthermore, for the proof of social Gestalts an additional phenomenon of Gestalts should be taken into consideration
originally related to morphogenetic fields or morphogenetic Gestalts (cf. Section 3.2.3). That means the empirical
distribution of the co-author pairs’ frequencies of the mixed four distributions should be of higher similarity to the
corresponding well-ordered Gestalt than the single distributions.
We are using the second option in our empirical test because of difficulties to find many journals with higher
co-author pairs’ frequencies than the studied four journals.
7.3. Overlapping or mixing of four distributions of co-author pairs’ frequencies obtained from four different
journals
In analogy to the method of overlapping faces, the four matrices of co-author pairs’ frequencies Nij (cf. Table 2 in
Section 1) are the basis for the method of mixing the distributions.
The mix Mij has to be calculated for each of the Nijk with k (k = 1, 2, . . ., 4) for the journals (k = 1 for Science, k = 2
for Nature, k = 3 for Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, k = 4 for Phys Rev B Condensed:

Results of the mixed co-author pairs’ frequencies Mij are resulting:

- for Cut 15, n = 120: R = 0.999, F = 13,431.0;
- for Cut 31, n = 496: R = 0.994, F = 9555.3.

323

All of these results show for the mixed distribution, both higher correlation coefficients between empirical and
theoretical values and higher F-ratios than for the single distributions separately.
The distribution of the mixed co-author pairs’ frequencies Mij obtained from the four single distributions (Cut 31)
shows the high evenness of the mixed pattern in Fig. 8 (“Tendency towards a good Gestalt”). In both Fig. 8a and b

(Fig. 8b is rotated by 90◦ ), the triple logarithmic presentation of the empirical pattern (first row, left) can be compared
with Gestalt (first row, right) and the “extension of Lotka’s Law” (second row). In analogy to Fig. 2, this is a proof for
the assumption that a model of social Gestalts can better describe the distribution of co-author pair’s frequencies than
by extension of Lotka’s Law.
7.4. Second proof for the assumption that the distribution of co-author pair’s frequencies can be better described
by a model of social Gestalts than by an extension of Lotka’s Law
The first proof was given by visualizations in Figs. 2 and 8. Fostering the proof for the assumption that a model of
social gestalts can better describe the distribution of co-author pair’s frequencies than by extension of Lotka’s Law we
are using another method additionally.
We consider the distribution of the ratios between the empirical Mij values of the mixed bibliographies to the
theoretical values Mij [In analogy to (6): Mij = constant/(ij)a ], cf. Fig. 9.
Under the condition, the distribution of the co-author pairs can be approximated by the extension of Lotka’s Law
we should expect the ratios between the empirical values to the theoretical values are rather similar to 1.
However in opposite, a social Gestalt emerged that can be described by the model. The above-mentioned social
regularity: “Birds of a feather flock together” is visible (left and right pattern) as well as one of the other regularities,
i.e. the reversed U-curve (middle pattern).
“Birds of a feather flock together” means, the frequencies of co-author pairs with the same frequency of papers are
higher than expected by the theoretical values (extension of Lotka’s Law) and is decreasing with increasing differences
between the productivities of authors. The relative frequencies of co-author pairs (ratio) with the same number of
papers (i = j) can be found in the main diagonal. The main diagonal is starting in front of the left and the right
patterns.
In correspondence with this result, we could find in each of the studied cases above (Cut 10, Cut 15, Cut 31 of all of
the four journals and of the mixed distribution), that the correlations R between the empirical values and the theoretical
values of Gestalts are higher than between the empirical values and the theoretical values of the extension of Lotka’s
Law.

8. Discussion and proposal for future investigations
The original Lotka’s Law refers to the distribution of author frequencies. However, with increasing collaboration
in science and in technology the study of the frequency of pairs or triples of co-authors is highly relevant. Kretschmer
and Kretschmer have shown that there are regularities existing for the well-ordered distribution of co-author pairs’
frequencies (Fig. 1). As far as Kretschmers’ know, there is not any other presentation of this kind of pattern available
in the former literature except the corresponding contributions of these authors in conference proceedings or in the
grey literature (Kretschmer, 2001; Kretschmer & Kretschmer, 2004, 2006a, 2006b, 2007a, 2007b).
Recently Kretschmer (1999a, 2002) has created a theoretical model for social Gestalts valid for social networks
in general. This model is based on both the Gestalt (field) theory and the old Chinese Yin/Yang theory. Yin and

H. Kretschmer, T. Kretschmer / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 308–337

325

Yang are the opposite poles of a single whole. They are complementary tendencies interacting dynamically with each
other, so that the whole system is open to change. Gestalts in social networks owe their shape and change of their
shape to the balancing interaction of these forces. All transitions occur with an uninterrupted sequence producing an
infinite number of shapes. The model includes two different Yin/Yang pairs. These pairs are in correspondence with
well-known general characteristics of structures in interpersonal relations in social networks. Typical shapes of special
expressions of Yin/Yang in the first pair combined with expressions of Yin/Yang in the second are selected and shown
in Fig. 5 (prototypes). The theoretical shapes can be produced by the mathematical function for the description of
social Gestalts.
Empirical findings have shown social Gestalts are existing matching the different theoretical prototypes.
We have assumed that the distribution of co-author pairs’ frequencies can be considered to be an example of social
Gestalts and therefore can be described by the corresponding mathematical function.
The first hypothesis says the distribution of the observed frequencies of co-author pairs can be considered to
be the reflection of a social Gestalt representing a prototype with the expression of Yang in the first Yin/Yang
pair and the expression of Yin in the second. We have verified this hypothesis both by visualization and by
regression analysis. However, we assume this expression of Yin in the second pair is strongly influenced by
the Lotka’s distribution, i.e. it is influenced by the decreasing frequency of authors Ai (or Aj respectively) with
increasing i (or j) publications per author. Although this influence exists, it fails to determine completely the
distribution of the frequencies of co-author pairs as shown in the empirical studies of the four journals (cf.
Figs. 2 and 8). This is one of the verifications of the third hypothesis. In correspondence, the distribution of
the ratios between empirical to theoretical values (extension of Lotka’s Law) can be considered as social Gestalt
(Fig. 9).
Regarding the second hypothesis, the overlapping of the four distributions of co-author pairs’ frequencies obtained
from four different journals has shown a very high evenness of the mixed pattern in Fig. 8, i.e. the “tendency towards a
good Gestalt” is enhanced in relation to the separate single distributions. Thus, using mixed distributions, verifications
of both the first and the second hypotheses are becoming easier. These studies have to be continued with other journals
in future.
Using observed frequencies but a classification of the data i and j is done (cf. Appendix A), changing shapes during
a longer time period can be made easier visible than without any classification. An example for changing the shape of
the Gestalt was shown with help of the co-authorship network of Indian medicine in the course of about 30 years (cf.
Fig. 6). It is interesting to study in future whether we can find any other changes of the Gestalts of the distribution of
co-author pairs’ frequencies during several decades.
Changing the shape of pattern with the expression of Yang in the first Yin/Yang pair and the expression of Yin in
the second can also be caused by using another method of interaction measurement (for example, relative frequencies
instead of observed).
The famous Lotka’s Law discovered in 1926 keeps on fascinating scientists from all fields. Lotka’s Law based on
single scientists P counting is valid for:
- single authored bibliographies, and
- under the condition of normal count procedure, also for multi-authored bibliographies. Both the theoretical and the
empirical distributions are well-ordered as known from the single authored bibliographies.
There are several other methods also possible for counting single scientists, pairs, triples, etc.
For example, weighted (or fractional) counting, in which each co-author of m co-authors per paper receives 1/mth
credit.
While normal count frequency distributions are well-ordered, fractional frequency distributions of, for example,
authors with a certain (fractional) number of papers are very irregular (Egghe & Ravichandra Rao, 2002; Ravichandra
Rao, Sahoo, & Egghe, 2003; Rousseau, 1992). Therefore, in future investigations are of interest whether social Gestalts
also emerge based on fractional frequency distributions.
We have selected in this paper a special basic research question of collaboration studies, in comparison with Lotka’s
Law and we assume that possibly this result is valid in many journals.
Beyond these well-ordered distributions of co-author pairs’ frequencies, long lists of other phenomena are existing
regarding collaboration in science because co-authorship depends on different aspects, for example on field, gender,

326

H. Kretschmer, T. Kretschmer / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 308–337

time, age, social, economic, political conditions, etc. Maybe in future studies we can find changing shapes of Gestalts
depending on these various aspects.

Appendix A. Methods for counting Ni and Nij (extended version)
Different versions of counting pairs P, Q are possible. Two of them will be presented below.

The number of publications i per author P is determined by resorting to the “normal count procedure”. Each time
the name of an author appears, it is counted (e.g. A three times: once in the first paper, and once each in the 4th and
8th papers).
First version:
Pairs P, Q are counted analog to single authors P in Lotka’s Law. The number of publications nc per pair P, Q is
determined (D, E one times; D, A one times; D, F one times; A, F one times; G, H one times; H, A one times; G, A
one times; H, G two times).
Second version:
Pairs P, Q are counted under the condition of both the first authors P count (i) and the second authors Q count (j),
i.e. the authors are ordered according to i or j respectively (cf. Table 5).
In the present paper the symmetrical form of matrix 1 will be studied, see Table 6.
In the symmetrical matrix, one can determine for each author P the number of his collaborators NP as well as the
total sum of his relationships through co-authorships CP .
The number of collaborators NP is the number of pairs assigned to the author P in the corresponding row of the
matrix. The number of relationships through co-authorships can differ between the pairs.
For example, the author P = H has two collaborators (NH = 2), namely Q1 = A and Q2 = G. While the author H has
one relationship with the collaborator A through co-authorships, there are three relationships with the collaborator G.

The sum of the relationships through co-authorships for the author P = H is, thus, four (CH = 4).
Two different matrices can be derived from the symmetrical matrix:
- Table 7 is the representation of the number of pairs Nij with authors who have i publications per author, with authors
who have j publications per author included in the bibliography.
Ai is 
the number of authors with i publications per author.
Ni = j Nij is the number of collaborators of all authors with i publications per author.
Ri = k = Ni /Ai is the average number of collaborators per author.
A former investigation on the topic collaboration and Lotka proposed the average number of collaborators per
author k to predict the productivity strata (Qin, 1995).
An experiment was introduced in Lotka’s Law with the new variable (k).
- Table 8 is the representation of the number of co-authorship relations Cij between authors with i publications per
author, and authors with j publications per author. The matrix Cij was the pre-requisite for earlier studies (Kretschmer,
1999a, 2002 in more detail). Because of the possible fluctuation at that time, however, a classification of the data i
and j was done corresponding to the logarithm resulting in a matrix CXY . The structure of this matrix CXY , as also of

the corresponding relative values, has been described. The results of this study have been taken as a pre-condition
for the present work.
Appendix B. Independence on the types of characteristics of persons and interaction
The well-ordered behavioural Gestalts emerge relatively independent of the type of personality characteristics and
of the type of interactions. An example is shown in Fig. 10. The upper pattern is taken from Fig. 3. Age is used as
personality characteristic and collaboration/communication as interaction. In the pattern below, education (X, Y) is
used as personality characteristic and friendship (HXY ) as interaction. Source, from which the Gestalt in this study was
developed: Table 1 (Marsden, 1981, p. 4). The values from the table were symmetrized (2450 data).
In the distribution of co-author pairs’ frequencies Nij (Figs. 2 and 8) co-authorships are the reflection of interactions
and the characteristic of persons is the scientific productivity.
Appendix C. Independence on the used statistical methods of interaction measurement
In one of the former papers (Kretschmer, 2002) well-ordered mathematically described Gestalts of co-authorship
networks could be shown relatively independent of the used statistical methods of the interaction measurement, cf.
Fig. 11.
Methods of calculating observed frequencies CXY (or Cij respectively) can be found in Appendix A, of the homophylic
index HXY (or Hij respectively) in Appendix D.
The methods of calculating relative frequencies (FXY ) can be found in Kretschmer (1999a).
For information: turning the Gestalt of the observed frequencies CXY (cf. Fig. 11, first row, left) around 90◦ we
receive rather the pattern of the distribution of number of co-authorship pairs Nij , given on the left of the lower row in
Fig. 1.
Appendix D. Homophylic index
To determine, whether the distribution of data within a matrix shows additional characteristic features, which have
arisen independent of the distribution of the marginal sums Ni and Nj , the homophylic index Hij can be used.
In some sociological studies of interpersonal relations in social networks of men (Wolf, 1996), this special homophylic index is used. That index provides information on the factor, by which the observed frequency in a cell of a
matrix deviates from the occupancy of this cell that would otherwise be expected in case of statistical independence
from characteristics. In order to calculate this index, we have to covert the matrix of observed frequencies Nij into a
new matrix using geometric mean. The special homophylic index Hij is defined as:
Hij =

Nij G
Gi Gj

(31)

where G is geometric mean of all matrix data, Gi is geometric mean of the data in row i, Gj is geometric mean of the
data in column j, Nij is the observed value and Gi Gj /G is the expected.
The homophylic index Hij is the ratio of the observed and the expected values.
Appendix E. General characteristics of structures in interpersonal relations in social networks (partly
presented in Kretschmer, 2002)
As for the structure of social groups, Metzger (1982, quoted by Metzger, 1986, p. 196) suggested that already in the
prehistoric times of higher vertebrates – birds and mammals – principally two succinctly distinguishable conciseness
forms of group structures had apparently existed that are also identifiable in man: step structure and ring structure.
The step structure reveals individual members arranged in a hierarchical sequence (pecking order of the chicken run),
whereas the “ring”-members, with their common concern in the center, are distributed “over equal heights”.
In his deliberations about the formation of a group Metzger (1986, p. 222) also touched upon the proverb “Birds
of a feather flock together” and gave it a grain of truth; but at the same time he suggested that similarity could only

be viewed as one factor among many, irrespective of whether it may turn out to be an indispensable, or just sufficient
requirement for group formation.
This point of view suggested by Metzger was adopted and, in this study, extended to additional knowledge from
the literature on the characteristics of structures in social systems. The results of studies, as contained above, indicate
that Metzger’s definition of “Gestalt”, which implies the balancing interaction of forces (tensions, field forces, etc.),

Fig. 11. Three Gestalts from international medicine and physics. Gestalts of observed frequencies (CXY ), Gestalts of the homophylic index (HXY )
and Gestalts of the relative frequencies (FXY ).

can be fully applied to social systems, even with retaining the validity of the conciseness (prägnanz) principle in a still
more precise form than it would have been thought possible by Metzger himself: hence, there are structures existing
in social systems that are strictly mathematically describable.
Without assuming the existence of a field-force equilibrium it would be difficult to explain how such mathematically
precise gestalts could exist, which are thought to have been established by the free cooperation (self-organization) of
scientists distributed over the entire world; cf. please, all three-dimensional figures of Gestalts in the co-authorship
networks of this study.
When discussing the structural characteristics of interpersonal relations in social networks reference shall be made
to one of Wolf’s works (1996) rather than to the many studies conducted and contained in the literature. As a result, a
definite structure can be identified that underlies to a great number of social processes of a distributive character, such
as the spreading of diseases, the propagation of information, the change of views or the distribution of innovations. A
generalization of this structure reveals three pivotal aspects:
- Over-coincidental similarity among persons in contact with each other (“Birds of a feather flock together”).
- Decrease of interpersonal relations with declining similarity.
- Emergence of the “edge effect” (cf. below);
The author illustrates these three aspects on the basis of an empirical example (Wolf, 1996, p. 35). Independently
of whether or not sociodemographic features, socio-structural characteristics or general approaches are taken into
account, it has repeatedly been shown that persons with social contacts reveal greater characteristic similarities than
it could have expected from persons with accidental associations. Relations may qualify as friendships, marriages,
professional contacts or other types of relationship.
Wolf, in one of his empirical examples, studied similarity underlying relations of friendship due to common education. It is unequivocally obvious that those persons, preferably, became friends who had achieved the same level of
education. These data of the same level of education can also be used to observe the edge effect. This term designates
the more pronounced similarity of friendly couples that is observable at the edges of status features (referring also to

H. Kretschmer, T. Kretschmer / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 308–337

331

persons at the lowest and also highest levels of education). Using the data file of Wolf it is possible to identify fourtimes-higher relations between high-school leavers and university graduates than it would be expected at a fortuitous
choice of friends. The tendency to choose status-homogeneous friends is less clearly perceptible with persons having
medium-level school degrees. Resultant at the same level of education a U-curve of data arised.
Two hypotheses are primarily suggested that should explain the edge effect. On the one hand it is maintained that the
persons of the lowest and the highest group would be visibly exposed due to their social position and thus developed
a stronger sense of affiliation than people having a medium-level social status. In addition, those people at a medium
status display a stronger orientation towards career so that they are reluctant to have frequent contacts with people of
the same level. On the other hand, it is suggested that the choices of people who are either at the very bottom or at the
top are blocked in one direction.
Quite similar results were obtained in other studies, i.e. the distribution of persons within age groups. The persons
belonging to the youngest and those to the oldest groups display a much stronger inclination to remain among their
groups than this is the case for the medium-age groups.
The well-known proverb “Birds of a feather flock together” can be conveniently integrated into this theory, together
with the empirical results published. Far less evidence is found, however, for the opposite saying “Opposites attract”,
although several efforts have also been put into proving its correctness, just think of Winch, Ktsanes, and Ktsanes (1954),
in which the complementarity of personality features was considered the decisive factor for partnership relations.
The descriptions available in literature on the crucial specifics of social structures refer to important and special
aspects of individual phenomena. In Wolf’s empirical example and in those of many other authors it became obvious
that only one of the two proverbs was used (Birds of a feather flock together), leaving out the other with its opposite
meaning, also the U-curve in one of its positions (edge effect) and not vice versa. But apart from the U-curve, the
assumptions are linear, for instance Wolf’s assumption (1996) on the “decrease of contacts with declining similarity”
(It is an extension of the proverb “Birds of a feather . . .”), or monotonously falling like the “Unidimensional Social
Distance Model” of Marsden. Marsden operates on the premise (1981): “. . . that the likelihood of social intercourse
between persons in groups is an inverse function of the distance between those groups along a single dimension” (p.
21). (Distance: distance in similarity.)
By contrast, this study will make an attempt to suggest that both opposing proverbs should only be perceived as the
conspicuously visible state of a holistic process caused by conditions to which the system under study was subjected
at the time of investigation. In addition, the same applies to both opposing views of U-curves, i.e. with edge effect on
the one side, and the reverse case, on the other side.
Appendix F. Development of a mathematical function to describe gestalts in social networks (partly
presented in Kretschmer, 2002)
F.1. Matrix of interpersonal relations
If one started from the assumption that all individual manifestations of social structure, as invariably mentioned in
the literature, have come to interact within a system of the equilibrium of forces, a hypothesis might be established on
the emerging forms of the adequate three-dimensional gestalts. These forms should be as simple, ordered, harmonic
and uniform as possible according to the conciseness (prägnanz) tendency and should be structured in line with definite
rules.
Their uniformity could be expressed by the visible retention of the balancing interaction of the different and also
opposing individual phenomena in social structures, as known from literature, and could become visible in only one
function. Thus, the diversity of patterns or Gestalts is then expressed by the variation of the parameters of this function,
with the diversity being dependent upon the conditions causing these patterns (e.g. the environment). These many
Gestalts can be classified into types in line with their similarity.
Both opposing proverbs and the U-curves in their contrasting situations give rise to reflect on the notion of complementarity. Capra (1996) wrote that the term complementarity (e.g. particle/wave) introduced by Niels Bohr has
become a firm integral part of the conceptual framework within which physicists attentively weigh the problems of
nature and that Bohr had repeatedly indicated that this idea could also be beneficial outside of physics. In conformity
with above Capra also suggested that the modern notion of complementarity had existed already in a clear-cut manner
in old Chinese thought, in the Yin/Yang teaching. Yin and Yang have to be seen as polar forces, as complementary

332

H. Kretschmer, T. Kretschmer / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 308–337

tendencies interacting dynamically with each other, so that the entire system is kept flexible and open to change. Capra
(1996) said: “It is important and difficult to understand for the people in the western world that these oppositions do
not belong to different categories but are opposing poles of only one whole. There is no separate Yin and no separate
Yang. All natural phenomena are manifestations of a continuous interplay between both poles, all transitions proceed
in a direct and uninterrupted sequence. The natural order manifests itself in a dynamic equilibrium between Yin and
Yang” (p. 32) (translated from German to English by the author).
It is conclusively consistent with all above considerations to seek a simple mathematical function (conciseness
principle) for the description of “Gestalt” which can encompass the complementary tendencies (Yin and Yang) in their
dynamic interplay and, accordingly, also the change of “Gestalt”.
The basic requirement for establishing this function is, however, the classification of persons according to a variable
of personality characteristics, for example age or education, etc.
Following the interpersonal relations between these persons (variable Z), for example friendship or co-authorship,
etc., will be recorded from the point of view of every individual person with value X of the variable of personality
characteristics to all the other authors with value Y of this variable.
If the relations are recorded from the point of view of every individual person (with X) to all the other persons (with
Y), then a symmetrical matrix of ZXY is obtained.
For example there are three friends classified according to education (elementary school: X, Y = 1; junior high school:
X, Y = 2; grammar school: X, Y = 3; university: X, Y = 4):
- person A with X (or Y respectively) = 1;
- person B with X (or Y respectively) = 4;
- person C with X (or Y respectively) = 3.
From the viewpoint of A with X = 1 there is one relation recorded to B with Y = 4, i.e. Z14 and one relation to C with
Y = 3, i.e. Z13 .
From the viewpoint of B with X = 4 there is one relation recorded to A with Y = 1, i.e. Z41 and one relation to C with
Y = 3, i.e. Z43 .
From the viewpoint of C with X = 3 there is one relation recorded to A with Y = 1, i.e. Z31 and one relation to B with
Y = 4, i.e. Z34 . (Symmetrical matrix of friendship relations ZXY , see Table 9.)
In general according to this principle matrices of interpersonal relations between persons classified according to a
variable of personality characteristics can be obtained.
The mathematical function Z = f(X, Y) to describe three-dimensional Gestalts in such social networks should depend
on the above named three pivotal aspects of the structure of social networks.
Three coordinated steps of approximation to the description of “Gestalt” will be discussed. Both the first and the
second steps are only related to similarity or dissimilarity but the third one concerns the three aspects of structures in
interpersonal relations in social networks in total.

F.2. Similarity and dissimilarity
Dissimilarity or contrary similarity between two groups of persons can be measured by the difference between X
and Y.
The difference is chosen because of the above-mentioned symmetry in its absolute form:
|X − Y |

H. Kretschmer, T. Kretschmer / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 308–337

333

There is both a minimum of the difference:
|X − Y |min
and a maximum of the difference:
|X − Y |max
The similarity is highest at the minimum and lowest at the maximum and vice versa the dissimilarity is highest at
the maximum and lowest at the minimum.
Moreover there is a complementary variation of similarity and dissimilarity. With increasing dissimilarity the
similarity is decreasing and vice versa.
Under the condition dissimilarity A is defined as difference
Dissimilarity :

A = |X − Y |

(10)

similarity has to be defined as complement ACOMPLEMENT .
Therefore, with increasing distance DA of the dissimilarity A from the minimum
DA = A − |X − Y |min = |X − Y | − |X − Y |min

(32)

similarity has to decrease according to the same distance from the maximum:
ACOMPLEMENT = |X − Y |max − DA
Similarity :

(33)

ACOMPLEMENT = |X − Y |max + |X − Y |min − |X − Y |

(11)

Resultant if the dissimilarity is moving to the maximum the similarity is moving to the minimum and vice versa.
Both the first and the second steps of approximation are two-dimensional representations of patterns only.
First step of approximation: The initial ideas on the mathematical function Z = f(X, Y) were developed in pursuit of
quantitative science research. It has for decades been shown here that the overwhelming majority of distributions of
bibliometric data can be represented as power function, i.e. as a Zipf-distribution instead of a Gaussian distribution, as
centrally used in psychology and in natural sciences.
For reasons of simplicity a power function was chosen as the starting point for considerations.
As a first step of approximation we can say the interpersonal relations are at least dependent on a power function of
the dissimilarity between persons.
Since in case of “equals” the value 0 cannot be raised to a negative power, the term |X − Y| is added by 1 resulting
the power function:
Z = constant (|X − Y | + 1)α


(34)

α

Z = constant (A + 1)

(35)

If the parameter α should be positive, then the idea of the proverb “Opposites attract” would be fulfilled in connection
with the assumption of “Increase of interpersonal relations with increasing dissimilarity” (cf. example in Table 10 and
Fig. 12, right).

Fig. 12. Power function of similarity or dissimilarity (35); on the left, the parameter α is negative: “Birds of a feather flock together” and decrease
of interpersonal relations with increasing dissimilarity. On the right, the parameter α is positive: “Opposite attract” and increase of interpersonal
relations with increasing dissimilarity.

The proverb “Birds of a feather flock together” and extended by the assumption of Wolf’s “Decrease of personal
relations with declining similarity” or Marsden’s “Unidimensional Social Distance Model” would all be complied with
by the power function in which the parameter α is negative (cf. example in Table 11 and Fig. 12, left).
A power function with only one parameter (unequal to zero) is either only a monotonically declining or only a
monotonically rising function, when referred to both proverbs: either “Yin” or “Yang”. According to Chinese philosophy
Yin and Yang are the opposite poles of a single whole. There is not an isolated exclusive Yin, or only a Yang. All
transitions occur with a direct and uninterrupted sequence. The natural order is secured by the dynamic equilibrium
between Yin and Yang.
In order to fulfil the inherent requirement that both proverbs with their extensions can be included in the representation, the second step of approximation will follow.
Second step of approximation: Like mentioned above with increasing dissimilarity similarity is decreasing and vice
versa. Dissimilarity A and similarity ACOMPLEMENT are two opposed varying factors and have to be inserted into the
equation with one parameter each. It depends upon the parameters to what extent Yin has retracted itself in favour of
Yang, or vice versa.
As a second step of approximation we can say the interpersonal relations are at least dependent on both a power
function of the dissimilarity between persons and another power function of the complement:
Z∗ = constant (A + 1)α (ACOMPLEMENT + 1)β

(9)

It depends upon the two parameters to what extent Yin has retracted itself in favour of Yang, or vice versa.
In an attempt to convey, in theory, a graphic idea on this function a systematic parameter variation was made and
the results are already shown in Fig. 7 above (explanation cf. Section 4.2).

H. Kretschmer, T. Kretschmer / Journal of Informetrics 1 (2007) 308–337

335

As mentioned above the mathematical function Z = f(X, Y) to describe Gestalts in social networks should depend on
three pivotal aspects of the structure of social networks. Two of the three aspects are already included.
However, if you still want to incorporate the third pivotal aspect called “edge effect” both forms of the U-curve
rather than only the two proverbs it is necessary to extend the formula according to the same principle (simplicity,
conciseness, Yin/Yang) to the sum of X and Y, i.e. the formula that so far included only the difference between X
and Y.
On the other hand, we can say we have extended our visualization up to two different Yin/Yang pairs. In the first
pair, Yin was considered as dissimilarity (A) with A = X − Y and Yang as similarity (ACOMPLEMENT ).
But in the second pair, Yin can be considered as low mixed value (B) with B = X + Y and Yang as high mixed value
(BCOMPLEMENT ) of a special personality characteristic.
The third step of approximation will follow.
F.3. Edge effect
Third step of approximation: Interpersonal relations Z at the main diagonal (X = Y) are more striking at the edges
than in the middle although the differences between X and Y did not vary:
A = |X − Y | = 0 = constant

(36)

The values of ZXY : Z11 or Z55 at the edges are higher than the values of Z22 , Z33 or Z44 in the middle. Whereas the
differences between X and Y are constant the sums are varying.
In analogy, you find this phenomenon parallel to the main diagonal.
Therefore, when we put A = |X − Y| and the opposite B = X + Y the following formula is obtained under the condition
that BCOMPLEMENT will be calculated according to the same principle as ACOMPLEMENT :
Z = constant (A + 1)α (ACOMPLEMENT + 1)β (B + 1)γ (BCOMPLEMENT + 1)δ

(16)

As a third step of approximation we can say the Gestalt of interpersonal relations can be described by the product
of the four power functions
- first of dissimilarity and second of its complement and
- third of the sum of the values of personality characteristics and fourth of its complement.
Accordingly, we have obtained a function with four parameters and one constant.
This function can encompass the complementary tendencies (Yin and Yang) in their dynamic interplay in two
Yin/Yang pairs (A/ACOMPLEMENT and B/BCOMPLEMENT ).
How do the three-dimensional gestalts look like that are described in this form? In Fig. 5 above, five prototypes of
Gestalts are shown. Proceeding in an example from Xmin = 1 and Xmax = 5, or from Ymin = 1 and Ymax = 5 respectively,
you can obtain the patterns by way of variation of parameters, as shown in Fig. 5. Such Gestalts can also be generated
with other values for minimum and maximum values of X and Y.
In the central Gestalt of Fig. 5 the proverb “Birds of a feather flock together” together with the extended version
“Decrease of interpersonal relations with declining similarity” become conspicuously visible, but also the U-curve
with the edge effect. However, in the lower Gestalt this tendency is less apparent, whereas “Opposites attract”
with the extended version “Increase of interpersonal relations with declining similarity” have become more strongly
perceptible.
The reversed U-curve is especially conspicuous in the upper Gestalt. In the left and the right ones the U-curve has
converted into a one-sided tilt. A large number of many patterns could be drawn with the same simple function.
