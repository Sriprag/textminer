Optimization of Active Muscle Force–Length Models
Using Least Squares Curve Fitting
Goran Abdulrahman Mohammed∗ and Ming Hou

Abstract—The objective of this paper is to propose an asymmetric Gaussian function as an alternative to the existing active
force-length models, and to optimize this model along with several other existing models by using the least squares curve fitting
method. The minimal set of coefficients is identified for each of
these models to facilitate the least squares curve fitting. Sarcomere
simulated data and one set of rabbits extensor digitorum II experimental data are used to illustrate optimal curve fitting of the selected force–length functions. The results shows that all the curves
fit reasonably well with the simulated and experimental data, while
the Gordon–Huxley–Julian model and asymmetric Gaussian function are better than other functions in terms of statistical test scores
root mean squared error and R-squared. However, the differences
in RMSE scores are insignificant (0.3–6%) for simulated data and
(0.2–5%) for experimental data. The proposed asymmetric Gaussian model and the method of parametrization of this and the other
force–length models mentioned above can be used in the studies on
active force–length relationships of skeletal muscles that generate
forces to cause movements of human and animal bodies.
Index Terms—Asymmetric Gaussian, curve fitting, least squares
optimization, muscle force–length relationship.

I. INTRODUCTION
NALYTICAL models of muscles are important for comprehension and development of strategies for motor control and for clinical restoration of motion to paralyzed limbs
through functional electrical stimulation [1]. The function of
skeletal muscles is to contract, and in doing so, to apply a force
against its environment [2]. The relationship between muscle
lengths and generated forces can be described by numerous existing models. These models are ranged in formulations like
cross-bridge to phenomenological models of muscle-force output, as a function of activation and muscle force–length–velocity
relationship [3].
Gordon et al. [4] used frog muscle fibers to investigate the
correlation between force and length in sarcomeres. Edman and
Reggiani [5] stimulated isolated frog fibers to explore the sarcomere force–length relationship, and fitted polynomial function to represent the experimental data. Siebert et al. [6] used
nonlinear regression to determine the parameters of two different models of cat muscles, and found the one from the two which

best fits the experimental data. Also, Rassier [7] carried out a
sequence of experiments on isolated sarcomeres and half sarcomeres of rabbit psoas muscles to investigate the mechanisms
of residual force enhancement associated with the force–length
relationship, with a fitted fourth-order polynomial function representing the force-length relationship of sarcomeres. Bahler
et al. [2] tested rat muscles to explore the dynamic properties
of force–length–velocity relationship of the muscle. Moreover,
Winters et al. [8] used muscles of rabbits to determine the isometric relationship between muscle active force and length by
using Hill’s two-element model consisting of an active contractile element and a passive elastic element connected in parallel.
To determine the active force–length relationship of muscle
fibers, in experiments the active force is obtained by subtracting
the predetermined passive force from the measured total force.
Nevertheless, in order to study the effects of muscle forces on
movements, it is necessary to consider the force–length relationship of whole muscle-tendon complexes, for example, use
of Hills three-element model. Rode et al. [9] showed that different connection schemes of the two elastic elements to the active
element can have significant effects on the active cat soleus
force–length relationship.
In the literature, there are quite a few mathematical models
for active muscle force–length relationship, such as the Gordon–
Huxley–Julian (GHJ) diagram [4] which is a widely used piecewise linear model, for example, in [6] and [10], cubic splines
interpolation of the critical points of the GHJ function [11], [12],
sinusoidal wave [13], Bézier splines [14], fourth-order polynomial function [5], [7], and Gaussian function [13]–[15]. Besides,
the Gaussian function is used in OpenSim, a software system
for modeling and simulations of musculoskeletal structures, as
a part of Thelen’s muscle model [16].
Although none of these muscle models, including the one to
be introduced in this paper, has been derived from first principles
of biomechanics and biochemistry, the GHJ model stands out as
it was put forward by Gordon et al. [4] on the basis of the sliding
filament theory, namely the cross-bridge hypothesis, whereby
the muscle force is considered to be produced through actin and
myosin filaments sliding past each other. Interestingly, among
others, Herzog et al. [17] showed that using only the lengths of
the actin and myosin filaments in the GHJ model yields good
estimations of measured sarcomere force–length relationship of
cat skeletal muscles. It is no surprise that the GHJ model has
gained wide acceptance over decades.
From an analytic point of view, a piecewise linear function,
such as the GHJ model includes four linear segments to represent the ascending limb, plateau, and descending limb of
the active force–length relationship. The cubic splines model

normally requires five or more knots to form the active muscle
force–length curve with functional continuity up to the second
order derivatives. Bézier splines produce a curve that does not
exceed the control points, which are representative of the data of
muscle force–length, and multiple Bézier curves are normally
needed to fit a large amount of data. Polynomials are in a simple
form and can fit the data reasonably well with a low order, while
a fitted polynomial could have difficulties in covering the wholelength range. The Gaussian model is a simple smooth function
and widely used. However, the main drawback of the standard
Gaussian function is that it cannot reflect the well-known asymmetry of the active skeletal muscle force–length relationship on
both sides of optimal muscle length.
To fit a particular model with experimental data, the models normally needs to be parametrized. For example, piecewise
linear functions, cubic splines, and Bézier splines have control
points which need to be represented by a minimal set of parameters, while the standard Gaussian and polynomial functions
are already naturally parametrized. After parametrization, these
different mathematical models can be optimized by using the
least squares optimization to fit the observed data. In this way,
these models can be compared.
The objectives of this paper are the proposal of an asymmetric Gaussian function, which is superior to the symmetric Gaussian function in terms of ability of fitting observed force–length
data, parametrization, and optimization of the most wisely used
force–length functions by using the least squares method. Simulated data and a set of rabbits extensor digitorum II (EDII) data
are used to illustrate the proposed Gaussian model along with
the optimization of various active force–length models.
II. METHODS
It is well-known that curve fitting is the most important application of the least squares method. Let f (l, p) be a known
function of l parametrized in p, consisting of a minimal number
of coefficients. The function is uniquely determined once the
parameter set p is known. Curve fitting is to find the optimal
parameter set p by minimizing the sum of squared differences
between measured values f¯i of f , and the values determined
from the model f (¯li , p) for measured values ¯li of l. That is,
given n measurement pairs (¯li , f¯i ), finding out p to minimize
[18]:
s(p) =

n


(f¯i − f (¯li , p))2 .

i=1

Several models of the active muscle force–length relationship
in the form of f (l, p) are to be optimized with respect to the least
squares criterion.
A. GHJ Diagram
The isometric active force–length diagram of frog sarcomeres
as elucidated by Gordon et al. [4] can be described by
f (l) = ai (l − li ) + fi ,

li ≤ l ≤ li+1

(2)

for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, where f and l are the force and length of the
sarcomere, ai represents the slope of the linear function, and

(li , fi ) are the knots, as shown in Fig. 1. The five knots with ten
coordinate coefficients determining the GHJ model can be specified with seven free positive parameters (d1 , . . . , d5 , fa , fb ) as,
for i = 1, 2, 3, 4,
f1 = f5 = 0 ,
l1 = d 1 ,

f2 = fa ,

f3 = f4 = fa + fb

li+1 = li + di+1 ,

ai =

B. Polynomial
It is to fit just one fourth-order polynomial [5], [7], namely
f (l) = b4 l4 + b3 l3 + b2 l2 + b1 l + b0

(3)

over the entire length range with the observed data. This is
a smooth and very simple function, and no parametrization is
needed.
C. Cubic Splines
The cubic spline model consists of piecewise third-order polynomials [11], [12]. Each of the polynomials passes two adjacent
knots with continuous first- and second-order derivatives, and
is in the form of (3), but with b4 = 0 over li ≤ l ≤ li+1 , for
i = 1, . . . , 4, where li s are those defined in (2). Since the natural cubic spline is used [19], all the sixteen (4 × 4) parameters
of the cubic spline model are uniquely determined by the five
knots specified in the GHJ model, and the requirements on the
C 2 -continuity of splines. This means that the cubic spline model
is also parametrized by the seven coefficients of the GHJ model.
D. Bézier Curve
A Bézier curve is a parametric curve considerably used in
2-D computer graphics to generate a smooth curve defined by
a set of control points, and it is C 2 -continuous. A set of quintic
Bézier curves have been used to represent active force–length
relationship [14], but not in the curve fitting context.
The five knots that specify the GHJ model are used in this
paper with four extra points added into the middle of the five
knots, in order to have a total of nine control points. These nine

632

specify initial values for (la , lb , lm , fm , r), and then through the
inverse mapping, initial values of (c0 , . . . , c4 ) can be obtained
for least squares optimization.

E. Asymmetric Gaussian

To illustrate the curve fitting of the force–length models described so far, simulated data were generated by using the original GHJ model for the whole range of length. Real experimental data of sarcomere force–length relationships would be ideal,
nevertheless the data reported in the literature are usually sparse
and do not cover the whole-length range.
Since the GHJ diagram was determined from the experimental data on multiple muscle fibers over length segments, it is
better understood as a representative model of multiple sarcomeres. This leads to a particular way of generating simulated
data. In this study, the original GHJ model is used to generate
ten other GHJ F-L functions through parameter variations, by
adding a sequence of noise to each of the seven parameters defining the GHJ model. Each of the ten individual GHJ functions
was used to generate 20 simulated data by adding a sequence
of noise to a prespecified sequence of lengths, and another to
the corresponding forces calculated from the GHJ mode. The
sequences of noise are normally distributed with standard deviation σ = 0.13 and mean μ = 0. In this way, 200 simulated
data were generated in total. Furthermore, a second set of simulated data has been generated using the asymmetric Gaussian
function defined in (5), and by repeating the same procedure
described above.
The GHJ model was originally presented as tension–length
relationship. To be consistent with the force measurements of
the experimental data discussed later, tension (km/cm2 ) is converted to force (N) by multiplying the tension by the gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s2 ), and the myofibril cross section
area (8.659×10−7 cm2 ) calculated from the frog myofibril mean
diameter (1.05 μm) in [20].
G. Experimental Data

To accommodate the asymmetric nature of the active force–
length relationship on both sides of the optimal length, an asymmetric Gaussian function is proposed. Parametrized by five coefficients c0 , . . ., c4 with c0 , c1 , and c2 being positive, and c3
and c4 positive or negative, this function is given by
−

f (l) = −c0 + c1 e



l −c 2
c3 +c4 l

2

.

(5)

Coefficient −c0 shifts the function down, −c0 + c1 is the maximum isometric force, c2 is the optimal length, and (c3 + c4 l)2 is
associated with the width of the function variable on both sides
of the optimal length.
Fig. 2 is a plot of function (5), and defines a new set of coefficients (la , lb , lm , fm , r) parametrizing the function. Compared
with the parameter set (c0 , . . . , c4 ), the new parameters have
clear physical meanings. Apparently, lm and fm are, respectively, the optimal length and force, la and la + lb are, respectively, the minimal and maximal lengths, and r is the slope of
the curve at la . The mapping relations between these two sets
of parameters are given in Appendix. It is usually convenient to

The experimental data of the force–length relationship of
rabbits EDII muscles [8] are used in the curve fitting of the
force–length models discussed in this paper. This set of data
were collected from the experiments on the rabbits EDII muscles
from 14 animal subjects.
H. Goodness of Fit
Goodness of fit measures how well the fitted mathematical
model agrees with the observed data. Two usual criteria the
root mean square error (RMSE) and R-square (R2 ) are used for
evaluation of fitness of the various force–length models with
simulated and real data.
I. Software Tool
Matlab 2013b is used in the software coding for the curves
fitted using least squares method. Also, the results have been
checked directly by using the curve fitting toolbox cftool in
MATLAB.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The results for all five fitted functions (GHJ, asymmetric
Gaussian, cubic splines, Bézier curve and polynomial) with the
simulated data of sarcomeres force–length are shown in Fig. 3.
As summarized in Table I, with the smallest RMSE and the
biggest R2 scores, the GHJ function best fits the simulated data
generated from the original GHJ model. The difference between
the RMSEs of the fitted GHJ and asymmetric Gaussian models
is only (0.37%), while the difference between the RMSEs of the
fitted GHJ and other models is around (3–6%). However, it is
not to say that there is a major difference among fitted functions.
In general, any one of these fitted functions could be regarded
as a good characterization of the sarcomeres force–length relationship with respect to the simulated data. The values of the
scaled optimal force fm (N) and optimal sarcomere length lm
(μm), and the number of parameters used in a specific function
are also included in Table I.
To see effects of different simulated data sets on outcomes of
curve fitting, the second set of simulated data generated from
the asymmetric Gaussian model is used. Table II summarizes
the outcomes of the fitting of the same previous five functions.
It is noticeable that the asymmetric Gaussian function with the
smallest RMSE and biggest R2 best fits the new simulated data
compared with other fitted functions. This suggests that the least
squares method is a reliable tool to pick up the best function
fitting with simulated and experimental data.
The statistical test results of the fitted curves with EDII muscle experimental data [8] are shown in Fig. 4. As summarized in

Table III, the GHJ function has the RMSE roughly similar to that
of the asymmetric Gaussian function, and their RMSE values are
slightly different from those of the cubic spline and Bézier function, whereas the polynomial function has the biggest RMSE
value among the fitted curves. Again, the difference between
the RMSEs of the fitted GHJ and asymmetric Gaussian models
is very small (0.2%), while the difference between the RMSEs of the fitted GHJ and other models is noticeable (2–5%).
Furthermore, the polynomial function diverts away from its descending limb end shown in Fig. 4, which is consistent with the
phenomena found in [7]. In general, the five fitted functions as
shown in Fig. 4 have approximately the same goodness of fit
and there is no significant difference between them in fitting
with respect to observed data, except for the polynomial function. The values of the optimal force fm (N) and optimal muscle

634

length lm (mm), and the number of parameters used in a specific
function are also included in Table III.
Other aspects of comparing these fitted functions include examination of the degrees of their smoothness, complexity of
computer coding and the number of parameters used. First, the
GHJ function is C 0 continuous, cubic spline and Bézier are C 2 continuous whilst the asymmetric Gaussian and the polynomial
functions are smooth functions with C ∞ -continuity. Second,
the asymmetric Gaussian and polynomimal are a single function compared with the multiple segmental functions of GHJ,
cubic splines and Bézier curves. The polynomial is the simplest
function without need of parametrization. Third, the asymmetric Gaussian and polynomial functions have five free parameters
whereas the other three functions need seven parameters. Additionally, the optimal isometric force fm and optimal length lm
can be automatically found from the fitted curves and or from
the optimal parameters. Note that the GHJ model has been normalized by the optimal force and length and hence parametrized
with five parameters and fitted using non-linear regression [6].
Experimental data are naturally not normalized. Although normalization of the data by fm and lm would reduce the number
of free coefficients parametrizing a force–length function as often done in the published reports, it is not recommended for
curve fitting because true fm and lm are never precisely known.
Normalization of a particular set of data based on approximate
values of fm and lm before curve fitting will normally reduce
fitness of the fitted functions with respect to the whole set of
data. Nevertheless, if needed, it is straightforward to normalize
a fitted function y = f (l, p) simply as ȳ = f (lm ¯l, p)/fm , where
ȳ and ¯l are respectively the normalized force and length.
The asymmetric Gaussian function appears to be new as it
has not been found in the literature across scientific disciplines.
In probability theory and statistics, the skew normal distribution
[21] is an asymmetric function, built as a product of the normal
distribution function and its cumulative distribution function.
The skew normal function is hence complicated than the asymmetric Gaussian function, and more importantly the former has
too few parameters to fit muscle force–length data. Another
modified Gaussian function in probability theory and statistics
is the split normal distribution [22] which combines two normal
distributions with different standard deviations on both sides of
the center of the distribution. Although the split normal function
could fit well muscle force–length data, it is a two-segmental
function and no longer smooth at the junction of the two half
normal functions.
Finally, it has been seen that the 4th-order polynomial shows
divergence towards the further end of the length range. Because
of that an increase of the polynomial order would not be considered appropriate. However, by introducing an extra parameter in
the asymmetric Gaussian function, the modified Gaussian model
is able to outperform the GHJ model. For example, fitting of the
modified asymmetric Gaussian function
−

f (l) = −c0 + c1 e



l −c 2
c 3 + c 4 l+ α (l)

2

with α(l) = c5 l2 or α(l) = c5 /l, is able to reduce the RMSE
from 2.692 to 2.654 which is less than all others RMSE of fitted

curves using EDII experiment data. A similar effect was also observed when fitting this modified asymmetrical Gaussian with
the simulated force–length data, where the RMSE is reduced
from 0.271×10−7 to 0.264×10−7 . However, the suggested formats have an extra parameter and do not appear as simple as the
originally proposed asymmetric Gaussian function.
IV. CONCLUSION
The asymmetric Gaussian proposed in this paper is a simple
and smooth function for active muscle force–length relationships. This function appears to be novel and may also have
potential in other applications.
By using the least squares method, the asymmetric Gaussian
model along with the well-known GHJ diagram and other models such as cubic splines, Bézier curve and polynomial have been
optimized and compared with respect to fitting of simulated data
and one set of experimental data. The results show that the GHJ
diagram and asymmetric Gaussian best fit the simulated and experimental data in comparison with other models studied in this
paper. The differences between these models in terms of RMSE
are, however, insignificant (0.2–5%) for experimental EDII data
and (0.3–7%) for simulated data.
Only five coefficients parametrize the asymmetric Gaussian,
while the other models (except for the fourth-order polynomial)
considered in this paper require seven coefficients. By including an extra parameter, but at the expense of having slightly
increased complex, the asymmetric Gaussian model can clearly
outperform all the other models considered in this study.
