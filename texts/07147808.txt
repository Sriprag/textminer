Magnetic Stimulation Using Coaxial Circular Coils
Mai Lu∗ , Member, IEEE, and Shoogo Ueno, Fellow, IEEE

Abstract—Objective: To investigate the possibility for
stimulating deeper brain regions while decreasing the electrical
field in superficial cortical regions by employing coaxial circular
coils. Methods: The Halo coil, Halo-circular assembly coil (HCA
coil) and Halo coil working with two circular coils (HTC coil) were
applied over a 36-tissue anatomically based head model. Threedimensional distributions of magnetic flux density, induced electric
field in head tissues were obtained by 3-D impedance method.
Results: For the case of HCA coil with current flowing in the same
direction in each of two coils, the field penetration depth by the conventional circular coil can be effectively increased at the expense of
reduced focality. For the case of the HTC coil with currents flowing
in opposite direction in the neighboring coils, overthreshold electric
fields can be produced in deep brain regions, while the subthreshold fields were produced in superficial cortical areas. Conclusion:
The HTC coil with varied coil parameters and different injected
currents provides a flexible way for deep brain stimulation with
better ratio of deep region field relative to field at the shallow areas.
Significance: The HTC coil is promising for deep transcranial magnetic stimulation, which may offer a new tool with potential for both
research and clinical applications for psychiatric and neurological
disorders associated with dysfunctions of deep brain regions.
Index Terms—Coaxial circular coils, deep brain stimulation,
impedance method, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

I. INTRODUCTION
RANSCRANIAL magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a
technique for noninvasive stimulation of the human brain.
Stimulation is produced by generating a brief, transient high
intensity magnetic field by passing a brief, transient electric current through a magnetic coil placed upon the scalp. The induced
electrical currents in the underlying cortical tissue produce a
localized axonal depolarization. As a noninvasive method to
stimulate brain, TMS has attracted considerable interests as an
important tool for studying the functional organization of the
human brain as well as a therapeutic tool to treat psychiatric
disease [1]–[3].
The first TMS stimulator used a circular coil due to its
simple geometry and ease of construction [4]. The significant
improvement of TMS focality has been realized by the introduction of the figure-of-eight coil (Fo8), which produces a relatively

focal electric field under the center of the coil [5], [6]. In the
past two decades, the search for even more focal TMS coils
continues, novel coil designs such as cloverleaf [7], slinky [8],
eccentric coils [9] as well as the multichannel coils [10]–[12],
and coils with shield plate [13], [14], etc., have been developed.
In parallel with the attempts to improve the stimulation
focality, there have been efforts to increase the stimulation depth.
The traditional TMS with round or Fo8 coil has obtained efficacy in the treatment of depression with a common target in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which was assumed to
be at the depth 2–2.5 cm from the surface of the head [15]. However, converging evidence suggests depression is not a disease of
a single brain region. Rather, it is generally viewed as a system
level disorder affecting integrated pathways [16]. Many studies
indicate that reward circuit is the focus in the study of depression [17]–[19]. The main component of the reward circuit is the
mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway consisting of the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmentum area, both interconnected
with the DLPFC. Other brain regions are also associated with
reward circuit, such as amygdala, medial prefrontal, cingulate,
and orbitofrontal cortices. Moreover, neuronal fibers connecting these brain subregions may have an important role in reward
and motivation. There is a reason to assume that direct activation
of these deeper prefrontal and limbic regions may increase the
antidepressant effect.
To stimulate deeper neuronal regions such as rewardrelated pathways directly, much higher stimulation intensities
are needed, as the electric field decreases rapidly as a function
of tissue depth. However, even if stimulation intensities could be
highly increased at the source, the use of standard TMS coils at
such high stimulation intensities does not allow safe stimulation
and can lead to undesirable side effects. These limitations have
led to the development of novel coil designs suitable for deep
transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS).
In the past decade, there are several coil configurations
such as double-cone, H-, crown, Halo coils potentially suitable
for dTMS have been developed [20]. The double cone coil has a
somewhat similar shape as the Fo8 coil except that the two rings
create a fixed angle between them and their diameter is larger
than that of Fo8 coil [21]. This coil, which is able to create a
greater electrical field intensity, is considered to be the useful
tool for stimulation of deeper brain regions compared with other
coils, and was reported to have the ability to stimulate the leg
motor area, which is 3–4 cm in depth. Another coil design for
dTMS is called H-coil [22], [23]. The H-coil with complicated
winding was composed of a base portion running tangential
to the scalp and return portions removed from the head. The
H-coils have been designed to stimulate the brain tissues at a

depth of 5–7 cm [24], [25]. In addition to the double-cone and
H-coils, large circular coils wound around the head have been
proposed for dTMS, including the crown coil with axial solenoid
structure [26], [27] and the Halo coil with flat circular structures
[28], [29].
In this study, we presented novel coil design with multiple
coaxial circular coils. Three circular coils with different coil
parameters were placed around the head at different axial planes.
The purpose of the coil design is to stimulate effectively deeper
brain regions while decreasing the electrical field intensity in the
superficial cortical regions through the field cancellation theory.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In
Section II, the coil design, the realistic head model used in this
study and the numerical method is discussed. The computational
results of the magnetic flux density (B-field) and the induced
electric field (E-field) in the head model for varied coil configurations is presented in Section III. This paper is concluded in
Section IV.
II. METHODS
A. Coil Design and Realistic Head Model
The multiple coaxial circular coil is shown in Fig. 1(a).
It consists of three circular coils. The top round coil and the
bottom Halo coil were set at fixed position, the middle coil
can be moved freely along the z-axis. The coil design can be
considered as the Halo coil working with two circular coils, and
it was defined as HTC coil. For comparison, the Halo coil, and
the Halo-circular assembly coil (HCA coil) were presented in
Fig. 1(b) and (c).
The realistic head model as shown in Fig. 2 was
generated from a man model developed by Virtual Family
project, which consists of four anatomical resolution models,

based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of two adults
and two children [30]. The man model has been segmented
into 77 tissues of which 36 tissues were involved in the present
head model considered for the simulation. The head model is
composed of 10 million cubic voxels with resolution of 1 mm.
Some important brain subregions such as hippocampus, midbrain, pons, pineal body, thalamus, etc., have been included in
the model.
The electrical properties for realistic head model are
modeled using the 4-Cole–Cole model [34], which was based on
Cole–Cole dispersion equation [31]. In this model, the complex
permittivity c of biological tissue subject to an electric field
with angular frequency ω is modeled by relaxation theory and
can be expressed as follows:

n, α is the distribution parameter for measuring the broadening of the dispersion, and Δn is the drop in permittivity in
the frequency range in which the time period 2π/ω is either
much smaller or larger compared to the relaxation time. The
physical constant ε0 is the permittivity of free space. These parameters are obtained by fitting to experimental measurements
[32], [33]. With appropriate parameter values for each tissue, the
aforementioned equation can be used to predict the frequency
dependence of the dielectric properties. Having calculated εc ,
the conductivity σ of each tissue is calculated as
σ(ω) = −Im[εc (ω)]ωε0 .

testing numerical convergence.

In the present realistic head model, since the number of tissue
type is more than that in original Gabriel list [34], various tissues
in realistic head model have been simulated with conductivities
and permittivities of similar tissues (i.e., hippocampus and thalamus have the dielectric properties of brain gray matter (GM)
from the Gabriel list). The tissue conductivities thus obtained
and used in the present calculation are shown in Table I.
B. Impedance Method
The time variation of the applied magnetic field causes
induced currents in the head through Faraday’s induction mechanism. These currents can be calculated using the impedance
method [35]–[37]. In this method, the head model is described
using a uniform 3-D Cartesian grid and is composed of small
cubic voxels with a dataset of dimensions (nx, ny, nz). The size
of each voxel is 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm. Assuming that, in
each voxel, the electric conductivities are isotropic and constant in all directions. The model is represented as a 3-D network of impedances. The magnetic fields are calculated using
Biot–Savart’s law, the induced currents are calculated using the
impedance method, and the induced electric fields are calculated
using Ohm’s law. The impedance method has been found to be
highly efficient as a numerical procedure for calculations of induced current densities and/or electric field in tissue-classified
anatomically based models during exposure to low-frequency
electromagnetic field. In our recent studies, we have successfully employed the impedance method in the modeling of TMS,
dosimetry of TMS and safety assessment of gradient magnetic
field in MRI [11], [14], [38], [39].
In order to check the numerical convergence of our 3-D
impedance codes, we presented a simple example by calculating the electric field in five-sphere model by applying a circular
coil as shown in Fig. 3. Coil parameters are given in Table
II. The five-sphere model consisted of five concentric shells—
representing the white matter (WM) (R1 = 70 mm), gray matter
(GM) (R2 = 77 mm ), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (R3 = 80 mm),
skull (R4 = 87 mm), and scalp (R5 = 92 mm). There are nearly
7.8 million cubic voxels with resolution of 1 mm in computational space.
Dependence of electric fields in a specific voxel (90, 90,
180) in the head model on the number of iterations is shown in
Fig. 4. It is observed that the results were well converged after
more than 10 000 iterations. Thus, all numerical results in the
following Section III were obtained for 10 000 iterations.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. HCA Coil
The design of an HCA coil and the distributions of B-field
and E-field in spherical head model have been analyzed by
numerical simulation and experimental measurements in [29].
In this paper, we discussed the field characteristics of the Halo
and HCA coils working with a realistic head model as shown
in Fig. 1(b) and 1(c). The conventional single circular coil was
located 3 mm above the vertex of the head and the Halo coil was
positioned 97 mm below the vertex of the head. The distributions
of both B-field and E-field were studied for three cases: 1) the
circular coil operated alone, 2) the Halo coil operated alone,
and 3) the HCA coil with the currents in each of the coil flow
in the same direction. The pulse currents with same working
frequency of 2381 Hz was fed into each of the coils. The reason
for using sinusoidal waveform is that the most widely used TMS
stimulators nowadays produce a biphasic current, whereas the
sinusoidal waveform is a good approximation for a biphasic
pulse. The cycle of 2381 Hz is about 420 μs, which is within
the pulse width (60–1000 μs) of typical TMS stimulator. The
current pulse is terminated after a single sinusoidal cycle [40].
The coil parameters and the injected currents for both coils are
shown in Table II.

contour outlines of scalp and GM were also included in each of
the figures. It was observed that the maximum value of B-field
is presented in the coil surface and decay quickly with distance
from the coils. The field penetration depth in the brain were significantly increased for the HCA coil [see Fig. 5(c)] compared

to that by only applying either a circular coil [see Fig. 5(a)] or
Halo coil [see Fig. 5(b)].

the range 0–100 V/m and all values above 100 V/m are shown in

E-field exceeding 100 V/m are mainly presented in the cortical
surface about 2 cm from the surface of the head. For Halo coil

skull orbit, and (b) partial enlarged drawing of tissues in small black box.

[see Fig. 6(b)], the E-field in deep brain tissues is around 60 V/m,
larger than the fields of 20 V/m in superficial cortical regions.
For the HCA coil [see Fig. 6(c)], the brain tissues with E-field
with 80 V/m were presented in both superficial cortical regions
and in deep brain regions, suggesting that the penetration depth
of circular coil has been effectively increased with the help of
Halo coil.
It was observed relatively high electric fields were induced in the area of the skull orbit in Fig. 6. To understand this,
we investigated the tissues at the cross section of head model
at coronal plane y = 80 mm slice as shown in Fig. 7(a). It
was found bone marrow is present inside the skull orbit. From
Table I, we know the conductivity of bone marrow is 2.44 ×
10−3 S/m, which is much smaller than that of skull (2.03 × 10−2
S/m). However, the calculated current density in bone marrow
is the same order of magnitude as that in skull orbit, which
resulted in high electric fields in bone marrow. An example of
detailed comparison of current density and electric field in bone
marrow and skull orbit is shown in Fig. 7(b), which is the partial
enlarged drawing of small black box in Fig. 7(a).
Fig. 8 shows the 3-D distribution of E-field on the surfaces
of GM and WM. The magnitude of E-field larger than 100 V/m
was represented by yellow color, and the GM and WM surfaces
were represented by red color. It was observed the induced

E-field on the GM and WM surfaces by circular coil [see
Fig. 8(a) and (b)] are much larger than those by Halo coil [see
Fig. 8(c) and (d)]. The HCA coil induces a wide E-field distribution at both the periphery and the top of the GM and WM
surfaces [see Fig. 8(e) and (f)].
Brain volume with E-field beyond 100 V/m as a function
of the distance from the vertex of the head is plotted in Fig. 9. It
was observed a significantly improved depth penetration, and a
much slower rate of decay of E-field as a function of the distance
from the cortical surface, when using the HCA coil relative to
the circular coil. It also indicates that the cortical stimulation is

much higher when stimulating deep brain regions by using the
HCA coil.

B. HTC Coil
In this part, we presented the induced field in realistic head
model by applying an HTC coil as shown in Fig. 1(a). The
pulse currents with same working frequency of 2381 Hz was
fed into each of the coils. The currents in neighboring coils was
set in opposite directions. Detailed coil parameters and injected
currents are presented in Table III. It is noted that the current in
Halo coil is two times larger than that in circular coil at the top
position.
Fig. 10 shows the distribution of B-field with the contour
outline of scalp and GM at coronal slice of y = 80 mm for the
Halo coil [see Fig. 10(a)], HCA coil [see Fig. 10(b)] and HTC
coil [see Fig. 10(c)]. We have observed that both Halo coil and
HCA coil produce regions of uniform B-field in brain tissues.
However, for the HTC coil, the magnitude of B-field in deep
brain regions is larger than that in superficial cortical regions. It
implies the HTC coil has the ability to directly stimulate deeper
brain structures without inducing wider electrical field spread
in superficial cortical regions. A quantitative comparison of Bfield at 40 and 90 mm below the vertex of the head for the HTC
coil is shown in Fig. 11.
Dependence of brain tissue volume with E-field (>100 V/m)
on the depth from the vertex of the head for Halo coil, HCA coil,
and HTC coil is shown in Fig. 12. It was observed that HTC coil
enables effective stimulation of deep brain regions with smaller
tissue volume compared to that achieved by either Halo coil or
HCA coil.
The field intensity of electric field in brain tissues at coronal
slice of y = 80 mm (as shown in Fig. 13) at different depth from
the slice apex along the test line for Halo coil, HCA coil, and
HTC coil are shown in Fig. 14. It was observed although the
curves looks similar at each depth, the magnitudes of electrical
field are different. The electric fields of both HCA coil and Halo
coil at each depth is much larger than that of HTC coil. In order
to reach the stimulation threshold of neurons, a total field of
100 V/m is needed [41], therefore, both Halo and HCA coils
will stimulate both deep brain region (at a depth of 68 mm) and
superficial cortical tissue (at a depth of 28 mm) simultaneously
[see Fig. 14(a) and (b)]. While the HTC coil only produces
excitation in deep brain regions (e.g., at a depth of 68 mm) with
subthreshold electric field in shallow cortical regions (e.g., at a
depth of 28 mm) [see Fig. 14(c)].

A quantitatively comparison of the maximum values of the
induced electric field in deep brain regions to that in superficial

regions to shallow brain areas is 2.07 for HTC coil, which is
better compared to that of 1.46 for Halo coil or 1.31 for HCA
coil.

IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the performance of coaxial circular coil designs
for dTMS have been numerically assessed. Three-dimensional
distributions of the magnetic flux density, electric field in realistic head model by using the Halo, HCA, and HTC coils
were obtained by the impedance method. For large Halo coil, it
provides the overall subthreshold field in the brain. For HCA coil
with current flowing in the same direction in each of two coils,
it enables the stimulation of the brain at greater depth than is
currently achievable with the conventional round coil. However,
higher and wider spread electrical fields were inevitably induced
in superficial cortical regions. For the HTC coil with specifically
defined coil parameters and coil currents, it produces the overthreshold electric fields in deep brain regions and subthreshold
fields in superficial cortical areas. The ratio of the induced elec-

tric field in deep brain regions to shallow brain tissue is better
for the HTC coil compared to Halo and HCA coils. The HTC
coil may offer a new tool for dTMS, which may be beneficial
in the study of reward and motivation mechanisms as well as in
the treatment of several neurological and psychiatric disorders.
Future work will consider to incorporate the anisotropy of the
WM in realistic head models to allow a more precise evaluation
of the induced electric field in brain tissues. We also intend to
investigate the dependence of induced field on the coil parameters, their relative positions and various pulse current protocols
to reduce the electric field in perimeter of the cortical surface to
improve the stimulation focality in specific deep brain regions
that are correlated to specific neural disorders.
