Securing While Sampling in Wireless Body Area
Networks With Application to Electrocardiography
Ruslan Dautov and Gill R. Tsouri

Abstract—Stringent resource constraints and broadcast transmission in wireless body area network raise serious security concerns when employed in biomedical applications. Protecting data
transmission where any minor alteration is potentially harmful is of
significant importance in healthcare. Traditional security methods
based on public or private key infrastructure require considerable
memory and computational resources, and present an implementation obstacle in compact sensor nodes. This paper proposes a
lightweight encryption framework augmenting compressed sensing with wireless physical layer security. Augmenting compressed
sensing to secure information is based on the use of the measurement matrix as an encryption key, and allows for incorporating
security in addition to compression at the time of sampling an analog signal. The proposed approach eliminates the need for a separate encryption algorithm, as well as the predeployment of a key
thereby conserving sensor node’s limited resources. The proposed
framework is evaluated using analysis, simulation, and experimentation applied to a wireless electrocardiogram setup consisting of
a sensor node, an access point, and an eavesdropper performing
a proximity attack. Results show that legitimate communication
is reliable and secure given that the eavesdropper is located at a
reasonable distance from the sensor node and the access point.
Index Terms—Compressed sensing (CS), electrocardiography,
wireless body area networks (WBAN), wireless physical layer
security (WPLS).

I. INTRODUCTION
IRELESS Body Area Network (WBAN) is a group of
sensors with wireless communication capabilities that
are placed on a human body for physiological monitoring and
diagnosis of health conditions. Sensor nodes in WBANs are required to be compact, unobtrusive, and energy efficient in order
to achieve a practical and wearable system that lasts for sufficient time. These requirements impose stringent limitations
on resources such as memory size, computation, and transmission capabilities. WBANs are expected to proliferate in the near
future, following a recent allocation of a dedicated industrial scientific and medical (ISM) frequency band of 2360–2400 MHz.
Wireless transmission makes WBANs prone to interception
and eavesdropping. This security problem significantly affects
the deployment of WBANs in biomedical applications where
privacy is required by the Security and Privacy rules of the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [1]. Health

care providers must ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an individual’s health records.
Securing information in a resource-constrained environment
is not trivial. Traditionally, the problem is approached by using
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [2] along with Diffie–
Hellman key establishing algorithm [3]. Even though this approach provides excellent security and is more energy efficient
than widely accepted public key infrastructure algorithms, it was
designed for systems with abundant resources. In other words,
the computational overhead introduced by AES has a noticeable
impact reflected in shortened network lifetime and a need for
substantial memory and computational power.
In this paper, we propose a lightweight encryption framework
for augmenting compressed sensing (CS) [4]–[6] with Wireless
Physical Layer Security (WPLS). The framework allows incorporating security in addition to compression while sampling an
analog signal using CS. Since there is no need for a separate
encryption algorithm, the proposed method imposes marginal
overhead and offers all benefits of CS.
The ability of CS to ensure security received some attention
in the past [7]–[9]. It is based on using the measurement matrix
as a symmetric key for encryption and decryption. However, the
problem of key distribution in these works is not addressed and
remains unsettled. To avoid the need for resource hungry key
distribution (Diffie–Hellman for example), we employ WPLS
along with Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). WPLS is
an active area of research [10]–[14]. In principle, it aims to
extract a common secret between legitimate communicating
parties through public discussion over the wireless channel by
exploiting intrinsic randomness of the channel. Among the variety of WPLS algorithms, we focus on low complexity algorithms
where secret bits are retrieved from Received Signal Strength
Indicator (RSSI) values. RSSIs are available to use in all commercial transceivers from packets going back and forth between
communicating parties. See also works [10] and [11] for more
examples on WPLS-related algorithms, [12] for the limitation of
key extraction under a proximity attack and [13] for the intrinsic
ability of wireless fading channels to secure information.
A simple WBAN shown in Fig. 1 is considered. It consists
of a single sensor node, an access point that resides either on
or off the body, and an eavesdropper listening to their conversation. Secret bits are extracted from RSSI values of incoming
packets. These bits are used as seeds to feed a LFSR to generate
an m-sequence. The output m-sequences are later reorganized
to form a CS sensing matrix by transmitter and receiver without coordination. A preliminary investigation of the proposed
method was provided in [14]. The work considered transmission of synthetic binary data over a Rician fading channel in the
presence of eavesdropper performing a proximity attack. By

means of simulation and estimated mutual information (MI),
it was revealed that generated sensing matrices ensure highquality reconstruction and therefore suitable for CS. It was also
shown that the adversary is unable to recover the original signal
while being physically close to one of the legitimate participants.
In this contribution, we propose a secure CS framework
applied to the growing field of wireless biomedical applications. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of the proposed
framework on real-world ElectroCardioGram (ECG) recordings
provided by the MIT Arrhythmia Database [15] using simulations and an experimental setup. To provide more extensive
analysis of reconstruction quality, we assess widely used similarity metrics of root mean square error (RMSE), relative error
(RE), and similarity coefficient (SC). In addition, we analyze
relative time complexity and security strength against basic attacks. Note that the method of estimation of MI provided in
[14] is different than the method used in this contribution due
to limited source data. To compensate for possible data undersampling, we employ a James–Stein estimator of MI [16]. In
[14], we assume a passive eavesdropper capable of carrying out
a proximity attack to reduce spatial selectivity of the Rician
fading channel.
II. COMPRESSED SENSING
CS emerged from the pioneering works of Candes et al.
[4]–[6] as a new signal-processing paradigm. It allows for perfect or optimal reconstruction of the analog signal from fewer
samples than it is suggested by the Nyquist theorem. This means
that compression can be achieved while sensing the analog
signal. Reduced number of acquired samples is beneficial for
WBAN. It mitigates the requirements imposed on sensor storage
and processing capabilities.
The signal is said to exhibit sparsity if its “information rate”
is much lower than its bandwidth. Sparsity simply reflects the
inherent ability of the signal to be compressed. Most physiological signals captured by WBANs have been proved to have a
domain with efficient representation. Thus, wavelets are shown
to be particularly useful in ECG applications [17]. Without loss
of generality, we employ CS in discrete-time domain where the
field has already reached its maturity.
Considering canonical CS, the signal of interest x can be
represented in some domain Ψcomprised of orthogonal set
N
of N × 1 vectors {ψi }N
i=1 : x =
i=1 si ψi = ΨS. Here, S is a
N × 1 vector of coefficients. Thus, the signal x is called k-sparse
if its representation above has exactly k(k << N ) nonzero

coefficients si . Exact sparsity allows for perfect signal recovery
but is rarely achievable for natural signals. More realistic scenario is when the signal x is compressible with only k large and
N − k small coefficients. CS can cope with this situation and
provide optimal signal reconstruction with small and bounded
error.
The sampling procedure of real, finite-length, sparse N × 1
signal x in canonical CS is given by
y = Φx

(1)

where Φ is an M × N (M < N ) matrix called the measurement
or sensing matrix and y is a sensed signal of size M × 1. CS is
capable of finding a solution for problem (1) when the sensing
matrix Φ satisfies the restricted isometry property
(1 − δk ) x22 ≤ Φx22 ≤ (1 + δk ) x22

(2)

for all k-sparse vectors x and some constant 0 < δk < 1.
Knowledge of the compressed measurements y and the sensing modality Φ gives the original signal x in sparsifying domain
Ψ after solving the optimization problem
min = Ŝ1 subject to y = ΦΨŜ

Ŝ

that finds vector Ŝ with the lowest L1 norm. Compared to sampling (1), the reconstruction problem (3) is computationally intensive. However, this fits perfectly into a typical WBAN setup
based on star topology where simple sensors communicate with
a more powerful access point.
III. PROPOSED ENCRYPTION FRAMEWORK
A block-diagram of the proposed encryption framework is
presented in Fig. 2. It defines four principal components namely
Secret Bits Distillation, LFSR, Sensing Matrix Generation, and
CS Encryption. Following is a detailed description of each block
and its role in the encryption/decryption process.
A. Secret Bits Distillation
The block objective is to extract a shared secret between a
sensor node and an access point. For this purpose, we exploit the
random nature and uniqueness of the wireless channel between
two legitimate communicating parties. There are many WPLS
algorithms that can be employed here. Thus, in simulation we
use a low complexity algorithm that follows [12] and performs
the reciprocal single bit quantization of RSSI values. In the
experiment, due to correlation of RSSIs in time, the algorithm

137

from [18] is employed. Detailed description of both is given in
Section IV. The output is a binary sequence of length m.
B. Linear Feedback Shift Register
The LFSR is a shift register whose input is a linear function of
register’s previous state. The m-stage LFSR takes a binary sequence of length m, called a seed, shifts it into adjacent positions
producing a single output bit, and fills the empty position on the
other end according to linear feedback. The most commonly
used feedback function is exclusive-or (XOR) of some bits in
the register. Due to finite number of possible states, the LFSR
output sequence is also finite and after some point replicates
itself. The carefully chosen linear feedback based on primitive polynomial allows generating a so-called maximal length
sequence or m-sequence. m-sequence has the longest possible
repeating cycle of 2m − 1 and features statistical properties that
resemble a truly random binary sequence. This fact is crucial
for our purposes since we use LFSR for spreading the distilled
secret across a longer bit sequence. A set of m-sequences is used
to generate a sensing matrix Φ.
C. Sensing Matrix Generation
To balance the number of zeros and ones, the input msequence is augmented with additional zero. Then, the elements
of a new sequence {0,1} are mapped to {−1,1} and reorganized
to form a matrix. The process is repeated L times for different
, . . . , ΦL .
m-sequences and results in a set of matrices Φ1 , Φ2
Arithmetic sum of Φi gives the sensing matrix as Φ = Li=1 Φi .
It follows that each entry of the sensing matrix converges to random variable with Gaussian distribution as L increases by the
central limit theorem. Note that larger values of parameter L
require more bits to be extracted from the channel, and thus, L
defines the amount of randomness in the system. In our preliminary work
 [14], we also defined a generation of a sensing matrix
Φ = Li=1 Φi with Bernoulli distribution. However, entrywise
matrix multiplication preserves the linearity property of LFSR
resulting in reduction of key space to as much as a length of a
seed. Therefore, Bernoulli matrices were excluded from further
consideration.
D. CS Encryption/Decryption
This block is the only part of the framework that differs for
transmitter and receiver. Transmitter follows (1) and performs
secure compressed sampling of the original signal x with matrix Φ. The sensed version y is now safe for transmitting to a
receiver over an insecure broadcast channel. On the other end,
the receiver solves a convex optimization problem (3) in order
to recover the desired signal x.
IV. EVALUATION FRAMEWORK AND METRICS
The evaluation framework consists of three parts which reflect different properties of the proposed encryption method.
The first part describes the methodology of analyzing the quality of reconstruction. The second and third parts address time
complexity and security aspects, respectively.

Fig. 3.

Block diagram of the performance evaluation framework.

A. Quality of Reconstruction
1) System Description: To evaluate the quality of reconstruction of the proposed framework, we perform simulation
along with experimental study. Both employ a wireless ECG
scenario depicted in Fig. 3 where a sensor node communicates
with an access point via wireless channel. The analysis also includes an adversary party Eve who intercepts legitimate packets
and tries to decipher the information. Other than eavesdropping,
we assume Eve is a passive adversary.
The communication is initialized by exchanging ordinary
packets resulting in RSSI values between the sensor node and
the access point. After sufficient number of packets, the sensor
and the AP generate a CS measurement matrix ΦAS according
to the proposed method. The sensor node applies secure CS (1)
to an ECG signal denoted as xS and transmits the result yS to the
access point. Having the matrix ΦAS and measurements yS , the
access point solves the optimization problem (3) and recovers
the original ECG as x̂SA . Using the proposed method, Eve aims
to extract the sensing matrix ΦE similar to ΦAS by performing
a proximity attack on the access point. For convenience and
generality, we normalize distance d between the AP and Eve by
communication wavelength λ and use the normalized distance
d/λ. The matrix ΦE along with the intercepted signal yS allows
Eve to run the same optimization problem and reconstruct the
original signal as x̂SE .
As was done in other ECG reconstruction work [19], we
evaluate the quality of reconstruction using SC, RE, RMSE. In
addition, we estimate MI which reflects security strength of the
system and is therefore discussed in Section IV-C.
2) Simulation Setup: In simulation, the wireless channel is
modeled as a distance-based Rician fading channel implemented
based on the model reported in [20] following the setup in [18].
The Rician fading occurs when one of the multipath components
is stronger than the others which was shown to be an applicable
assumption in many practical applications including WBANs. It
uses a single parameter called K-factor to determine the strength
of the dominant multipath component relative to the rest of the
multipath components. We assume no noise in the model, and
thus, ΦAS is always equal for legitimate participants. It is also
assumed that simulated RSSI values are not correlated in time.
The WPLS algorithm in simulation setup is derived from [12]
and works as follows. Consecutive RSSI estimates are grouped
into a sequence of length m. After the mth estimate is obtained,
the average of the sequence is subtracted from each element, and

138

the signs of the elements are then taken to form a binary output
seeding the LFSR. The process is repeated until the desired
number of sequences L is generated.
We conduct a set of simulation experiments applied to
MIT Arrhythmia database [15] using different combinations of
K-factors (K = 0, 1, 3, 10) and normalized distances (d/λ =
0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 1). The database is obtained from 47 subjects
and contains 48 half-hour excerpts that were digitized at 360
samples per second per channel with 11-bit resolution over a
10-mV range. The secure CS measurement matrix is generated
once for each record. Thus, MI and other metrics (RE, RMSE,
SC) are also evaluated per ECG recording. The size of the matrix is 128 × 256 which defines a compression ratio of 50%. It
also determines the LFSR seed length m = 15. The polynomial
of our choice is x15 + x14 + 1. Daubechies db10 lv4 transform
is used as a sparsifying basis Ψ [21]. The choice of the number
of steps L in Sensing Matrix Generation block is a tradeoff between system security strength and latency. In the simulation, L
is chosen to be 10. This gives 150 random bits extracted from
the channel which is sufficient to prevent a brute force attack.
Reconstruction problem (3) is solved by the CVX package [22].
3) Experimental Setup: The experiment is of similar design
as described in [18] and includes extracting secret bits from
the wireless channel. This corresponds to a single Secret Bits
Distillation block in Fig. 2. Extracted bits are taken offline for
generation of CS sensing matrices which are then applied to the
same MIT database as in simulation. For consistency, all applicable parameters from simulation retain their values for the
experiment. The experimental study complements our simulation and provides real-world validation of our approach.
In the experiment, we use a TeloSB platform that includes a
Chipcon CC2420 RF Transceiver and a TI MSP430 microcontroller. The transceiver is IEEE 802.15.4 compliant and operates
at a data rate of 250 kbps in the 2.4–2.835-GHz ISM band. A
packet transfer protocol is designed to have 4 octet carrying
address, RSSI, and sequence Number. The TeloSB supports
the open source operating system TinyOS version 2.1.1. Along
with IEEE 802.15.4, TinyOS implements the WPLS protocol
extending the total message length to 38 octets. The resulted
transmission time per packet is 1.2 ms.
The test is performed while a test subject walks randomly
around a typical residential environment which includes a
20 ×13.5 living room, 15 ×10 and 18 ×12 bedrooms, a
kitchen, and a bathroom. The test subject is a 29-year-old man
weighing 92.5 kg and standing 1.86 m tall. The experiment considers key extraction in close proximity of a sensor node, an AP,
and Eve. The sensor node is placed on the sternum of the test
subject. The AP and Eve are placed 8 in to the right and to the
left of the sensor node, respectively. The test lasts for 10 000
message exchanges.
As opposed to simulation, consecutive RSSI estimates in the
experiment are correlated. To eliminate this problem, we employ a simple distillation algorithm presented in [18]. For clarity
and convenience, we now briefly describe the algorithm. For
every received packet, RSSI value is extracted, and the difference between the current and the previous values is calculated.
The absolute sum of Q differences |S| is then compared to a

predefined threshold β. When the absolute sum exceeds the
threshold, i.e., |S| > β, a secret bit is generated by taking the
sign of S. After multiple sets of Q differences, legitimate communicating parties exchange the indices of those sets who passed
the threshold. This facilitates the agreement process and allows
excluding the bits generated by only one of the parties. Note that
it is very unlikely for Eve to generate the same bit sequence due
to different RSSI estimates. Following the encryption block diagram in Fig. 2, the generated binary sequence is used to generate
a CS sensing matrix that is applied to ECG database in the same
manner as was done in simulation. The values of Q and β are
set to achieve a reliable key extraction with appropriate statistical properties. From [18], it follows that values of Q = 8 and
β = 10 are suitable for our purposes since the corresponding
binary sequence is of sufficient length and passes all applicable
NIST randomness tests [23].
B. Complexity and Computing Cost
We analyze the complexity of the proposed encryption framework relative to the reference framework. The proposed method
is essentially the one given in Fig. 2. In the heart of the reference
method is the AES block that encrypts data after compression
with CS takes place. For consistency, proposed and reference
frameworks use the same WPLS algorithm for extracting the
encryption/decryption key. In practice, decryption is done on a
more powerful device compared to a sensor node, and therefore,
only encryption process is analyzed.
In the analysis, we use the following notations. SCS —number
of samples being processed in a single step of CS, SAES —
number of bits being processed in a single step of AES, TCS
and TAES —processing time of a single step for CS and AES,
respectively, TW PLS —time required to generate a random bit
sequence of approximately 128 bits, TLFSR —time required to
generate a m-sequence using LFSR, TSM G —time required to
generate a sensing matrix having L m-sequences, α—CS compression ratio, q—number of bits per sample.
Thus, time Tprop to encrypt NB blocks of SCS samples
each using the proposed model consists of extraction of a random sequence of bits (TW PLS ), generation of L m-sequences
(L × TLFSR ), formation of a sensing matrix (TSM G ), and CS
execution for each block (NB × TCS )
Tprop = TW PLS + L × TLFSR + TSM G + NB × TCS .

(4)

Time Tref to encrypt same NB blocks using the reference
model consists of key generation (TW PLS ), execution of
CS for all NB blocks (NB × TCS ), and execution of AES

SCS × q × α

C. Security Strength
MI quantifies how much information x̂SE carries about xS ,
i.e., whether the framework is secure in presence of an eavesdropper in close vicinity. More specifically, we use a James–
Stein (JS) shrinkage estimator of MI presented in [16]. The
estimator exhibits high computational efficiency and is reliable
in case of undersampled data. JS cell frequencies are estimated
L
as Θ̂k = λtk + (1 − λ)Θ̂M
k , where λ ∈ [0, 1] is the shrinkage
intensity, tk is the shrinkage target distribution which is set to
L
is the corresponding maximum likelihood
uniform, and Θ̂M
k
frequencies. MI is found for both simulation and experimental
setups the same way it was done for quality of reconstruction.
For estimation of MI, the reconstructed and original signals are
quantized to 8 bits and scaled to have identical finite set of possible values. In addition to evaluating MI between Eve and the
sensor node, we also evaluate MI between the AP and the sensor
node to make sure reconstruction is successful.
In the remainder of this section, we present security strength
of the proposed framework when basic cryptographic attacks are
applied. Since the order in which the seeds are extracted is irrelevant for sensing matrix generation, the complexity of the basic
brute force attack is diminished by the number of permutations
of L and is given by 2m ×L /L!. For L = 10 and m = 15, this
results in enormous computational efforts (2m ×L /L! > 2128 ).
However, Eve can substantially reduce the complexity by exploiting proximity to a legitimate receiver. For example, if Eve is
close to the AP then their wireless channels are highly correlated
meaning that the random sequence she extracts is very similar
to the one used in legitimate communication. In other words,
distance from the AP helps the attacker deduce how many bits
need to be flipped in order to get the correct key. If Eve knows
that the corresponding distance results in approximately h different bits, then the complexity
	of this attack is described as the

number of combinations m h×L .
Initially, we find a minimum Hamming distance that makes
combinatorial search impractical just as in the case of AES,

i.e., of the same complexity as 2128 . In the next step, we perform simulation experiments to investigate the behavior of the
Hamming distance between Eve’s and AP’s distilled binary
sequences for different combinations of normalized distances
(d/λ = 0.01, 0.02, . . . , 2) and K-factors (K = 0, 1, 3, 10). At
each step, the average Hamming distance over 1000 realizations is calculated. All other applicable parameters reported in
Section IV-A2) remain the same. Results help to reveal how
far Eve needs to be in order to achieve the minimum required
Hamming distance that was found previously.
Another security aspect that needs careful consideration is
how sensitive a measurement matrix is to small variations in
an underlying binary sequence and how it affects the quality of
reconstruction. If two similar sequences result in similar measurement matrices, then it is not necessary for Eve to get the
exact key. This allows Eve to simplify the exhaustive search.
To measure the similarity between sensing matrices, we use
a relative perturbation metric  = Φ − Φ 2 /Φ2 , where Φ
and Φ are measurement matrices generated from original seed
and similar to it, respectively. Thorough theoretical analysis of
effect of relative perturbation on the reconstruction process was
provided in [24]. In our simulation, for every combination of a
Hamming distance from a set [1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15] and a number of steps in sensing matrix generation L in the range [1–50]
the average  over 100 random is computed. All applicable simulation parameters are identical to Section IV-A2).
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Quality of Reconstruction
Simulation results are reported in Table I. Each entry in the
table is an average value over 48 records. Corresponding results
for an adversary are given in parentheses next to values for legitimate participants (AP and sensor node). Similarity metrics
of SC, RE, RMSE confirm that for all tested scenarios the signal
reconstructed by Eve on average cannot be used for practical

purposes. Reconstruction examples for Eve and the AP are presented in Fig. 6(b) and (d), respectively. It is obvious that the
signal recovered by Eve does not resemble the original pulse. At
the same time, the legitimate party meets or exceeds commonly
used benchmark values. Thus, SC has an average value of 0.996
whereas the acceptable values is known to be greater than 0.9
[19]. Besides, SC exhibits extremely low variation which attests
to the consistency of the results. The same applies to RE and
RMSE. Their average values and variance also conform with
Fig. 6 and exhibit almost perfect reconstruction at the AP and
completely unacceptable for Eve. The overall trend of the table
is as follows: As distance increases, Eve’s ability to reconstruct
the data is diminishing. Her mean values become farther and
farther away from the correct values while variance is getting
smaller.
The experimental setup places Eve 8 in away from the sensor node. Along with communication frequency of 2.4 GHz, this
gives an approximate values of d/λ = 1.6. Experimental results
are reported in Table II. As in Table I, corresponding values for
Eve are given in parentheses. It is seen that the experimental
results are almost identical to simulation and provide near perfect average values with low variance of all metrics for AP. Eve
experiences extremely poor average and low variance without
adequate reconstruction.
Similar experiment was done in the residential environment
with the subject sitting down for L in the range of [1 − 20].
Results showed that the proposed matrices behave similarly to
pseudorandom Gaussian matrices for all tested L and give the
same trend as reported in Table II.

Relative time complexity showed in (6) implies that ρ < 1
meaning that the complexity of the proposed encryption framework is always lower. For example, using typical parameter values (SCS = 256 samples, α = 0.5, q = 11 bits, SAES =
128 bits) results in relative complexity ρ = TCS /(TCS + 11 ×
TAES ) which gives a time advantage of not needing to process 11 AES blocks. On a 64-bit core i7 machine with 8 Gb of
RAM running Windows 7, MATLAB implementation of AES
from [25] results in TAES ≈ 2 ms, whereas TCS ≈ 0.02 ms.
This yields ρ ≈ 0.9 × 10−3 . Although MATLAB would not be
implemented on a sensor node, this number gives an idea of the
difference in computing costs.
C. Security Strength
Estimated MI is given in Tables I and II for simulation and
experimental results, respectively. In both cases, we observe
the same trend as for other similarity metrics. MI between the
original signal and the signal reconstructed by the AP is always
high and has a value of 2.86 bits on average. At the same time,
Eve’s reconstruction is poor. When d/λ is low ≈ 0.1 the wireless
channel does not provide sufficient spatial selectivity, and there
are cases when Eve is able to extract the measurement matrix
equal to the one extracted by the AP or the sensor node. This
fact is reflected in higher average values and higher variance of
MI. The low variance of Eve’s as well as AP’s MI implies that
Eve’s reconstruction is consistently erroneous while the AP’s is
stable and accurate.
	

Analyzing the number of combinations m h×L , we conclude
that the minimum Hamming distance hm in required to prevent
combinatorial search is 45 bits assuming L = 10 and m = 15.
Variation of the Hamming distance with normalized distance
and multiple K-factors is presented in Fig. 4. Ripple behavior
is due to correlation properties of the Rician channel and is
expected. If Eve is located farther than d/λ = 0.16 away from
the AP, then the system is secure since the Hamming distance
is always above hm in . Rician factor has only marginal effect on
security strength in the considered scenario.
Sensitivity of a sensing matrix in terms of relative perturbation is presented in Fig. 5. As the number of steps used in sensing

matrix generation increases, the relative perturbation decreases.
This result is expected since for high L smaller subset of its
random bits gets affected. For fixed L > 1, relative perturbation becomes stronger according to the number of flipped bits.
Fig. 6(a–c) shows that even in the worst-case scenario for Haming distance h = 1, Eve cannot obtain proper reconstruction
achievable for  < 0.05 [24].
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed a framework for securing wireless links in biomedical applications involving WBANs. The
framework relies on using a CS measurement matrix as a symmetric key for encryption and decryption. The matrix is securely
generated for both sensor node and an access point using low
complexity WPLS algorithm. The encryption becomes an integral part of the sampling process eliminating the need for
a separate encryption algorithm and substantially minimizing
computational and memory requirements critical for WBANs.
The framework was evaluated in the presence of an eavesdropper
performing a proximity attack and applied to 48 ECG records
of MIT Arrhythmia database. Both simulations and experiment
methodologies that reflect a wireless ECG monitoring scenario
were employed for testing. Simulation assumed Rician fading
channel and provided control on a normalized distance and Rician K-factor. Experiment extracted bits from the wireless channel and included a sensor-node, an access point, and Eve on the
test subject’s body where Eve was located 8 in away from the
sensor node.
Various similarity metrics SC, RE, RMSE verified that while
an AP achieves accurate reconstruction with near optimal average values and low variance, Eve’s reconstruction is extremely
poor and useless for any practical purposes. Using the MI
and relative perturbation metrics, we showed that the proposed
framework generates strong keys and is resistant against an
eavesdropper located at a reasonable distance. Further security analysis concluded that distance larger than d/λ = 0.16
from legitimate participants is safe. This allows for practical
consideration and gives a distance of 2 cm assuming 2.4-GHz
communication frequency. Through relative time complexity
analysis, it was shown that the proposed encryption framework is much faster than its state-of-the-art competitor based
on AES.
