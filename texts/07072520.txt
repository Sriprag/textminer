Reflectance Photoplethysmography as Noninvasive
Monitoring of Tissue Blood Perfusion
Tomas Ysehak Abay∗ , Student Member, IEEE, and Panayiotis A. Kyriacou, Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—In the last decades, photoplethysmography (PPG) has
been used as a noninvasive technique for monitoring arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (PO), whereas near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been employed for monitoring tissue blood
perfusion. While NIRS offers more parameters to evaluate oxygen delivery and consumption in deep tissues, PO only assesses
the state of oxygen delivery. For a broader assessment of blood
perfusion, this paper explores the utilization of dual-wavelength
PPG by using the pulsatile (ac) and continuous (dc) PPG for the
estimation of arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) by conventional
PO. Additionally, the Beer–Lambert law is applied to the dc components only for the estimation of changes in deoxyhemoglobin
(HHb), oxyhemoglobin (HbO2 ), and total hemoglobin (tHb) as in
NIRS. The system was evaluated on the forearm of 21 healthy
volunteers during induction of venous occlusion (VO) and total
occlusion (TO). A reflectance PPG probe and NIRS sensor were
applied above the brachioradialis, PO sensors were applied on
the fingers, and all the signals were acquired simultaneously. While
NIRS and forearm SpO2 indicated VO, SpO2 from the finger did
not exhibit any significant drop from baseline. During TO, all the
indexes indicated the change in blood perfusion. HHb, HbO2 , and
tHb changes estimated by PPG presented high correlation with the
same parameters obtained by NIRS during VO (r2 = 0.960, r2 =
0.821, and r2 = 0.974, respectively) and during TO (r2 = 0.988, r2
= 0.940, and r2 = 0.938, respectively). The system demonstrated
the ability to extract valuable information from PPG signals for a
broader assessment of tissue blood perfusion.
Index Terms—Beer–Lambert law, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), optical sensors, photoplethysmography (PPG),
physiological monitoring, pulse oximetry (PO).

I. INTRODUCTION
ONINVASIVE optical technologies have contributed significantly in the continuous and noninvasive monitoring
of tissue blood perfusion. Several modalities, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), pulse oximetry (PO), laser Doppler
flowmetry, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and reflectance
spectrophotometry, have been used in research and clinical settings for the quantitative and qualitative assessment of different
tissue perfusion parameters [1]–[7].
PO is a noninvasive optical technique, which utilizes light at
two different wavelengths for the estimation of arterial oxygen
saturation. Light is applied to tissue and the light attenuations
at red (R) and infrared (IR) wavelengths are filtered, processed,

and separated in pulsatile (ac) and continuous (dc) PPG [8]–
[10]. The ac component reflects the changes in pulsatile arterial
blood volume and it is synchronous with the cardiac cycle. The
dc component depends on the nature of the tissue interrogated
and represents the relatively constant absorption of skin, venous
blood, nonpulsatile arterial blood, and total blood volume in the
light path [9]–[13]. Whereas ac components have a clinical importance for their synchrony with the cardiac cycle, dc components provide equally valuable information, such as hyperemic
or hypoaemic states, temperature changes, sympathetic outflow,
venous volume fluctuations, and other regulatory mechanisms
[13]. AC and dc components, at the two different wavelengths,
compose a physiological signal also known as PPG [9]. The
ratio between ac and dc components [i.e., ratio of ratios, see (1)]
is directly correlated to arterial blood oxygen saturation (SpO2 )
by empirical curves, permitting the continuous and noninvasive
monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation by PO [8]–[10], [12].
PO has found many applications in clinical and research settings. The most adopted use is the estimation of SpO2 . The
technique provides continuous and noninvasive indication of
SpO2 , presenting a valuable alternative to intermittent arterial
blood sampling. PO is nowadays used in clinical settings for
quick identification of possible hypoxic states, such as respiratory failures, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases [8], [12]. PO is regularly used in emergency medicine,
surgery, and neonatal care [8], [9], and it is mandatory during
anesthesia [14].
The PPG trace, however, is not only used for the estimation
of SpO2 by PO. Several studies have been undertaken to prove
the ability of the PPG waveform on providing additional information. The PPG has been used for heart rate analysis, pulse
transit time estimation, blood pressure estimation, respiration
rate, vascular tone assessment, arterial and venous assessment,
tissue viability, vasomotor function, thermoregulation, and as a
perfusion indicator [13]–[19].
Although PO is a powerful clinical tool, it presents some limitations that have to be considered carefully by researchers and
clinicians. Limitations such as anemia, skin pigmentation, nail
polish, low perfusion, light interference, and venous pulsations
might introduce errors [8]–[10], [20], [21]. Even though SpO2
and PPG waveform analysis provide a wide range of information, the majority of research in this field focuses in PO, which
is a technique that does not indicate the correct blood perfusion
status [12], [20]. Moreover, we did not find clear evidence in the
literature on whether PO (or the sole analysis of SpO2 and ac
PPG signals) could be considered as a reliable indicator of tissue
blood perfusion when perturbations such as venous occlusion
occur [12], [13], [22], [23].

NIRS is another optical technique, which estimates the
concentrations of oxyhemoglobin (HbO2 ), deoxyhemoglobin
(HHb), and total hemoglobin (tHb) in deep tissues [24], [25].
Light in the near-infrared spectrum (700–1000 nm) is utilized
in NIRS due to the relative transparency of human tissues in this
spectrum, permitting a deeper penetration of light [25]. In NIRS,
the Beer–Lambert law is used to derive the hemoglobin concentrations from the attenuation of light at two or more wavelengths
[24]. An index representing the tissue hemoglobin saturation is
then estimated from the ratio of HbO2 and tHb [24]. In the last
decades, NIRS has found a growing range of applications as a
tissue perfusion monitoring technique. The technique has been
applied to measure cerebral and muscle perfusion, oxygen consumption, and blood flow in tissues. It also found applications
in neonatal and foetal monitoring, somatic and splanchnic perfusion, peripheral vascular diseases, trauma medicine, sepsis,
and plastic surgery [24]–[30].
NIRS and PO differ in the assessment of tissue blood perfusion. Even though conventional PO is a valuable technique
adopted as a standard of care in many clinical environments,
it only permits the quantification of arterial oxygen saturation.
This restricts its use as an instrument for the assessment of
global oxygen delivery to tissues. Therefore, PPG so far has
been mainly utilized for the estimation of arterial oxygen saturation by PO, with limited attempts in exploring the capability
and potentials of the technique for a more complete assessment of tissue perfusion [31]. Alternatively, NIRS, by measuring
changes in hemoglobin concentrations, provides a more inclusive representation of tissue blood perfusion. The tissue oxygenation index (TOI) and hemoglobin concentration changes
provide an indication of other possible alterations of tissue perfusion, such as arterial blockage, venous congestion, or oxygen
delivery/consumption mismatches [28], [32].
This paper presents the implementation and application of a
PPG instrument that offers a more comprehensive assessment
of tissue blood perfusion by PPG. The system comprises a processing system and a reflectance PPG probe, and it uses ac and
dc components for the estimation of arterial oxygen saturation
(SpO2 ) by conventional PO. Furthermore, dc components are
processed separately, as in NIRS, to estimate changes of concentrations in HbO2 , HHb, and tHb using the Beer–Lambert
law. The proposed system has been evaluated in healthy volunteers during induced vascular occlusions on the forearm. A
commercial pulse oximeter and a NIRS system have been used
simultaneously as references throughout the measurements.
II. METHODS
Fig. 1 shows the block diagram of the system proposed in this
study and it comprises:
1) PPG processing system (ZenPPG);
2) reflectance PPG probe;
3) data acquisition (DAQ).
The optical components [light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and
photodiode] apply and detect light to and from the tissue. Red
and Infrared light separation is achieved in the PPG processing system by multiplexer/demultiplexer and controlled by the

microcontroller technology. Raw PPG signals are acquired by
DAQ system. Signals are further separated into ac and dc components and SpO2 is estimated from their ratio. DC components
are used to estimate changes in HHb, HbO2 , and tHb. Each part
of the system will be described in the following sections.
A. PPG Processing System—ZenPPG
As commercial pulse oximeters present limitations on displaying and offering raw PPG signals, we opted for the use of the
ZenPPG, a custom-made research PPG system. The ZenPPG is a
flexible, dual-channel, battery-operated PPG processing system
developed by the Biomedical Engineering Group at City University London [33], [34]. The instrument permits the acquisition
of raw, dual-wavelength (red and infrared), and dual-channel
PPG signals [33].
The ZenPPG is composed of a modular architecture of exchangeable modules: System bus, power supply, core board, current source, transimpedance amplifier, and probe module [33].
Customized PPG sensors can be connected to the system via
DB9 connectors on the probe board. The current-source board
is responsible for providing two separate currents to the LEDs.
Currents in one channel are fully digitally controlled, whereas
regulated by trimmers in the second channel [33]. The intermittent switching of light RED/IR is achieved by multiplexers,
whereas the separation of the detected light in the two distinctive
wavelengths is achieved by demultiplexers [33]. The multiplexing/demultiplexing process is controlled in the core board by
microcontroller technology (Atmel ATtiny 2313-20SU, Atmel
Corp., USA). The ON/OFF switching of RED/IR light sources
is carried at a frequency of 1 kHz. Once the light has been emitted to the tissues, the detected light from the photodiodes (i.e.,
current) is converted to voltages by transimpedance amplifiers,
before being demultiplexed [33]. ZenPPG also comprises a 64p-i-n NI connector (National Instruments Corporation, Austin,
TX, USA) for the acquisition of the signals via LabVIEW and
the digital control of the LEDs currents [33]. The system allows
the full control of light emission and the simultaneous acquisition of raw PPG signals (ac and dc) from the two independent channels. ZenPPG has been recently used in PPG studies

C. SpO2 , HHb, HbO2 , and tHb Estimation
As mentioned above, ac and dc PPG signals are used to estimate arterial oxygen saturation. The ratio of the components
(i.e. ratio of ratios, R), at the two wavelengths, is defined as
R=

ACRED /DCRED
ACIRED /DCIRED

(1)

where ACRED and ACIRED are, respectively, the peak-topeak amplitudes of the pulsating arterial signal at red and
infrared wavelengths and DCRED and DCIRED are the relatively constant values of light attenuation at the two respective
wavelengths.
The following standard empirical equation correlates the ratio
of ratios to arterial oxygen saturation, SpO2 :
SpO2 = 110 − 25(R).

carried by the Biomedical Engineering Group at City University
London [34]–[36].
B. Forearm Reflectance Probe
A reflectance PPG probe was developed and manufactured in
order to be connected to ZenPPG and to acquire raw PPG signals
from the forearm. Fig. 2(a) shows the mechanical drawing of the
reflectance PPG probe. It comprises of a printed circuit board
(PCB), two red LEDs (KP-2012SRC-PRV, Kingbright, Taiwan),
and two infrared LEDs (KP-2012 SF4C, Kingbright, Taiwan)
with peak emission wavelengths at 660 and 880 nm, respectively. These two wavelengths are opposite with respect to the
isobestic point and they have different hemoglobin absorption
coefficients, consenting the acquisition of R/IR signals for the
estimation of SpO2 [8]. The LEDs were driven to a corresponding radiant power between ∼1.5 and ∼3.6 mW/sr. A silicon photodiode with a large active area of 7.5 mm2 (TEMD5010X01,
Vishay Intertechnology Inc., USA) was selected for the acquisition of the backscattered light. The LEDs and photodiode were
placed at a center-to-center distance of 5 mm. This distance has
been considered in the literature as satisfactory for the acquisition of PPG signals with adequate signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)
[37]–[39].
In order to guarantee the mechanical stability and to protect the optical components from ambient light interference, the
PCB was enclosed in a black case. The case was designed on a
3-D CAD design software and it was manufactured in polylactic acid plastic by a 3-D printing technology. Black rubber was
used to shield the photodiode from light shunting and a layer
of clear epoxy medical adhesive (Dymax, 141-M) was used to
cover the LEDs and the photodiode. Fig. 2(b) shows the final
manufactured version of the reflectance PPG probe.
An identical PCB probe has been manufactured and enclosed
in a pulse oximeter clip for the acquisition of raw reflectance
PPG signals from the finger.

The formula has been extensively used in PO, and it correlates directly the ratio of ratios to arterial oxygen saturation [9].
Equations (1) and (2) were used in this study to estimate SpO2
from PPG signals.
DC components represent the amount of light reaching the
photodiode, thus, directly relating to the amount of blood volume interrogated by the light beam. Optical densities (OD), at
the two light wavelengths employed, were used in this study to
express changes in light attenuation due to variations in blood
volumes. ODs (or light attenuation changes) were calculated
from time changes of dc components as


(3)
ODλ1 = ΔAλ1 = ln
DCλ1


DC(0)λ2
(4)
ODλ2 = ΔAλ2 = ln
DCλ2
where ΔAλ1 and ΔAλ2 are, respectively, the changes in light
attenuation at the wavelengths λ1 and λ2 , ln is the natural logarithm, DC(0)λ1 and DC(0)λ2 are the dc values at the beginning
of the measurement for both wavelengths, and DCλ1 and DCλ2
are the dc values throughout the entire measurement.
The modified Beer–Lambert law is extensively used in NIRS
and it correlates the attenuation A of a monochromatic light
beam to the absolute values of chromophore concentration,
knowing the scattering contribution in the light path [24].
Equation (5) shows the generic form of the modified Beer–
Lambert law
I0

Aλ = ln

where Aλ is the light attenuation at the wavelength λ, I is the
light intensity detected, I0 is the light emitted, [C] is the concentration of the chromophore C, ελ is the extinction coefficient
of C at wavelength λ, d is the distance between light emitter and
photodetector, DPF is the differential pathlength factor, and G
is a scattering factor. Continuous wave instruments are unable
to determine the factor G [24], [25], thus limiting to the only
estimation of relative changes in hemoglobin concentrations.
As our system is a continuous wave instrument (i.e., PPG system), we opted for a differential approach, permitting only the

2190

calculation of relative changes in hemoglobin concentrations
from the start of the measurement. This approach permits to assume that scattering in the tissue is constant during the measurement, thus eliminating G from (5) [24], [25]. Equations (6) and
(7) show the system of linear equations for a dual-wavelength
differential approach used in our PPG system

HHb and HbO2 at the two wavelengths, Δ[HHb] and Δ[HbO2 ]
are the changes in concentration of the two hemoglobins, d is

DPF is the differential pathlength factor.
The system of linear equations composed by (6) and (7) yields
the solutions for the changes in hemoglobin concentrations

However, DPF values for the distance adopted in our PPG
system (i.e., 5 mm) are not available in the literature. As a full
estimation of the optical pathlength in the tissue was not feasible, we opted for representing the results as relative changes
of hemoglobins concentrations in mM·cm ([absolute concentration] × [optical pathlength]).

females, mean age ± SD: 31.18 ± 7.55) were recruited for the
investigation. Subjects with a history of cardiovascular disorders
were excluded from the study. The physiological measurements
were performed in the Biomedical Engineering Research Group
laboratories at a room temperature of 22 ± 1 °C. The volunteers
were seated in a comfortable chair and their left arm was rested
on a pillow to minimize vascular compression. The reflectance
PPG probe was positioned on the volar side of the left brachioradialis, while the NIRS probe was placed above the same muscle,
proximal to the PPG probe. The probes were kept in place on the
skin by double-sided clear medical tape. In order to avoid eventual optical impediment, the clear medical tape was previously
cut at the light emitters and photodiodes locations. Care was
taken in not compressing the probes on the skin surface during
placement of the sensors and during the entire protocol. The
custom-made finger PPG probe was connected to the second
digit of the left hand, while a commercial transmittance pulse
oximeter sensor (Radical 7, Masimo Corp., USA) was placed on
the third digit of the same hand. A cuff pressure was positioned
on the left upper arm in order to induce vascular occlusions. The
cuff was connected to a sphygmomanometer for the full control
of the occlusions pressure. ECG was monitored and acquired
throughout the measurements.
The volunteers’ blood pressure was measured prior to the
commencing of the measurements. After recording 5 min baseline measurements, the cuff was rapidly inflated to 60 mmHg
(inflation time < 4–5 s) in order to induce venous occlusion and
maintained at this pressure for 2 min. The occlusion pressure
was then quickly released for 2 min (deflation time < 1–2 s)
before reinflating the cuff for further 2 min. Total occlusion was
performed by inflating the cuff to 20 mmHg greater than the
volunteer’s systolic pressure. After 2 min of total occlusion, the
cuff pressure was finally released and DAQ was stopped as soon
as all the signals returned to baseline values.

D. NIRS System
A commercial NIRS system (NIRO 200NX, Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., Japan) was used as a reference for the estimation
of relative changes in concentration of HHb, HbO2 , and tHb.
This NIRS device uses LEDs for the emission of light at three
different wavelengths: 735, 810, and 850 nm [40]. Two silicon
photodiodes, at a small spacing between each other, detect the
backscattered light and spatially resolved spectroscopy is applied for the absolute estimation of hemoglobins concentrations
[41]. TOI is calculated as the ratio between HbO2 and tHb as
TOI =

HbO2
.
HbO2 + HHb

(11)

An emitter-photodetector spacing of 4 cm has been adopted
in this investigation, guaranteeing the deep penetration of the
light beam in tissues [24], [25].
E. Experimental Setup and Protocol
The system was evaluated on healthy volunteers by inducing
vascular occlusions on the forearm. Ethical approval was gained
from the Senate Research Ethics Committee at City University
London. Twenty-one (21) healthy volunteers (13 males and 8

F. Signal Acquisition, Processing, and Analysis
All the signals (raw PPGs, NIRS parameters, and pulse
oximeter signals) were digitized by two NI-PCIe6321 DAQ
cards and acquired on a LabVIEW virtual instrument (VI) (National Instruments, USA). The analogue signals were acquired
at a sampling frequency of 400 Hz. The VI was developed
to acquire, filter, and display the measurements in real time,
while raw signals were directly saved in a text file for further
postacquisition analysis. Algorithms were used for the real-time
estimation and display of SpO2 as in (1) and (2).
Offline analysis of the signals was performed on MATLABR2013a (The Mathworks Inc., USA). AC PPG signals
were extracted by applying a bandpass digital filter (cutoff frequencies: 0.5–4 Hz) to the raw PPG signals. DC components
were obtained with a low-pass digital filter (cutoff frequency:
0.1 Hz). SpO2 was calculated by applying (1) and (2) to a 3 s
rolling window. Hemoglobin concentration changes and TOI,
along with SpO2 and single-wavelength PPG from the commercial pulse oximeter, were directly acquired from the devices’
analogue outputs. Hemoglobin changes were estimated from dc
PPG components by applying (6)–(11).

All the parameters were expressed as their mean (±SD). Mean
SpO2 and TOI values were calculated during 1-min baseline segment, venous occlusion, and total occlusion. Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed to determine correlation between
changes in concentration of hemoglobins estimated from dc PPG
components and NIRS during vascular occlusions. Mean increment (or drops) in hemoglobin concentrations were calculated
as means of differences between hemoglobin values at the beginning and end of the occlusions. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test
was also used to determine any statistical significant difference
in the forearm SpO2 from baseline to venous occlusion.
III. RESULTS
A. SpO2 and TOI
Fig. 3 shows typical PPG traces acquired from the forearm
and fingers of one volunteer during baseline measurements. AC
PPGs from the forearm presented lower amplitudes compared
with the fingers.
SpO2 was calculated as in (1) and (2) from the PPG signals
from both forearm reflectance probe and from the finger. Table I
shows the mean SpO2 , TOI values, and SD for the forearm and
fingers during baseline, venous occlusion, and total occlusion.
SpO2 estimated from the forearm during baseline measurements presented a lower mean value (92.0 ± 3.1%) when

compared with SpO2 values acquired from the custom-made
finger probe and the commercial probe (98.3 ± 2.0% and
98.5 ± 0.8%, respectively). SpO2 from the fingers did not
exhibit any considerable mean desaturation from baseline during venous occlusion, while, in contrast, SpO2 from the forearm showed a statistically significant desaturation (Z = −2.72,
p = 0.006) with a mean drop of 3.1 ± 3.6%. TOI exhibited a
mean drop of 3.3 ± 4.4% throughout venous occlusion. During
total occlusion, all the SpO2 values have dropped as expected.
These values are erroneous and are not reliable readings originated from the absence of arterial pulsations and consequent
increase in R. The disruption of oxygen delivery during total
occlusion caused a decrease in HbO2 concentration and a consequent drop in TOI value. Fig. 4 shows the means and SD of
SpO2 values and TOI during venous occlusion.
B. Hemoglobin Concentrations
Figs. 5–7 show the mean changes of HHb, HbO2 , and tHb
during venous and total occlusions. The hemoglobin concentrations changes estimated from dc PPG components followed the
same trend with the signals produced by the NIRS system. HHb
exhibited increase in its concentration in both occlusions. These
were due to stagnation of venous blood caused by the blockage
of its return in both occlusions. HHb concentrations estimated
by NIRS and ZenPPG presented a significant correlation during
both venous occlusion (r2 = 0.960, p < 0.05) and total occlusion (r2 = 0.988, p < 0.05). At the end of both occlusions, the
concentrations of HHb returned to baseline value.
HbO2 presented two different behaviors during the vascular
occlusions. During venous occlusion, the oxygen delivery to

tissues was not compromised; hence, an initial increase was
observed, followed by a steady state. This increase is believed
to be due to the impaired washout of blood caused by venous
occlusion. During total occlusion, the oxygen delivery to tissues
was impeded causing a constant drop of HbO2 throughout the
occlusion. HbO2 estimated by NIRS and ZenPPG presented
a high correlation during venous occlusion (r2 = 0.821, p <
0.05) and total occlusion (r2 = 0.940, p < 0.05). At the release
of total occlusion, HbO2 manifested an overshot caused by the
postischemic hyperemic response of the tissue.

Total hemoglobin was estimated by summing HHb and HbO2
as in (10). Thus, its increase during venous occlusion is mainly
due to the rise of HHb concentration. Total hemoglobin can be
used as an estimate of total blood volume in tissues; hence, its
increase during total occlusion represented the gradual accumulation of blood volume due to venous blood stagnation and
steady arterial blood in-flow. During total occlusion, tHb showed
an initial increase, followed by a relatively constant trend.
Total hemoglobin estimated by NIRS and ZenPPG showed
high correlation during both venous occlusion (r2 = 0.974,
p < 0.05) and total occlusion (r2 = 0.938, p < 0.05). At the
release of venous occlusion, tHb returned to its baseline values.
An overshot of tHb was observed in all cases following the release of total occlusion, indicating the postischemic hyperemic
response.
Table II shows the mean increments and decrements of HHb,
HbO2 , and tHb estimated by NIRS and ZenPPG during both
occlusions. The values were calculated as the means of the
differences in amplitude at the beginning and end of the occlusion periods.

IV. DISCUSSION
Mean SpO2 and TOI values during baseline measurements
were in their physiological ranges and they were in good agreement with previous studies [23], [29], [42]. However, baseline
SpO2 , which was estimated by the reflectance probe on the forearm, presented lower values compared with SpO2 calculated
from the fingertips. This has not to be considered as a physiological difference in arterial blood saturation as both sensors estimated SpO2 from the same arterial branch. Nevertheless, these
lower values for the forearm are in agreement with the trends
showed in an earlier similar study by Mendelson and McGinn
in which a reflectance PPG sensor was developed for the estimation of SpO2 from the forearm and calf of healthy adults.
Regression analysis revealed lower SpO2 values estimated from
the forearm and the calf when compared with a transmission
finger probe [43]. These differences were attributed to the difficulty to extract high amplitude PPG from locations with a
low capillary density, such as the forearm and calf [43]. In order to facilitate the acquisition of PPG signals from the two
locations, Mendelson and McGinn incorporated a heating element into the reflectance sensor to increase the skin temperature
[43]. However, in this study, we decided not to use the same
approach as heating the skin might affect the blood perfusion,
thus conflicting with vascular occlusions adopted in this study.
We also observed from our experience that low values of SpO2
on the forearm might be due to higher R-values caused by a
higher absorption of red light in the forearm when compared
with fingers. Moreover, the presence of large superficial veins
on the forearm may affect the accuracy of the SpO2 values
calculated [44].
Except the forearm, all the estimated SpO2 values did not
significantly vary during venous occlusion. In contrast, and as it
was expected, they dropped during total occlusion. The absence
of any relevant drop during venous occlusion should be considered as a serious limitation of PO on monitoring tissue blood
perfusion. Shafique et al. observed that significant drops in ac
PPG amplitude were seen only for occlusion pressures exceeding the diastolic pressure (e.g., 75 mmHg). We think that this
inability of PO may introduce risks in situations when a more
complete perfusion monitoring is required. As PO relies on pulsating arterial blood for the estimation of SpO2 , the absence of
pulsations in total occlusion causes the pulse oximeter to fail in
the calculation of SpO2 [23]. Even though a desaturation during
venous occlusion was detected, the presence of arterial pulsations (i.e., ac PPG) and an unaffected SpO2 on the fingers might
still be misjudged as an adequate blood perfusion [13].
TOIs measured from the forearm exhibited the expected drops
in agreement with previous studies when NIRS was used in
conjunction with vascular occlusions [29], [30]. During both
occlusions, TOI showed desaturations providing a fair indication of changes in tissue blood perfusion. Throughout venous
occlusion, the continuous increase in HHb concentration and
relative steady state of HbO2 caused a constant fall in TOI in
all volunteers. The increase in HHb and the simultaneous decrease of HbO2 during total occlusion caused a more severe TOI
desaturation.

SpO2 and TOI are extensively used in clinical and research
settings [8]–[10], [12], [20]–[23], [28]–[30]. The SpO2 only
provides oxygen delivery information (i.e., arterial blood oxygen saturation) and it cannot be used as a sole indicator of tissue
blood perfusion. Its dependence on pulsatile arterial PPG components restricts its use in situations where changes in perfusion
are not directly reflected in arterial blood. On the other side, TOI
(also called in the literature as StO2 or rSO2 ) is not dependent on
arterial pulsations and its lower values, compared with SpO2 , are
more representative of mixed blood oxygen saturation (arteries,
capillaries, and veins) [25]. Moreover, the index is directly calculated from the ratio of HbO2 and tHb (HbO2 + HHb) and its
changes indicate perfusion variations directly affecting this ratio. Thus, we believe that the estimation of ΔHHb, ΔHbO2 ,
and ΔtHb, along with SpO2 , from PPG signals could improve the ability of the technique in following changes in blood
perfusion.
The changes in HHb, HbO2 , and tHb obtained from dc
PPG components were in agreement with the same parameters measured by NIRS as can be seen in Figs. 5–7. The three
hemoglobins measured by NIRS followed the same trends described previously in the literature when venous or total occlusion occur [29], [32], [45], [46]. The hemoglobins changes
allowed the distinction of venous occlusion where it was unnoticed by conventional PO. At the release of occlusion, all the
hemoglobins returned to their baseline. In particular, HbO2 and
tHb exhibited correctly the postischemic hyperemic response of
the tissue after the release of total occlusion. The initial increase
of tHb in total occlusion was due to the noninstantaneous inflation of the cuff over systolic pressure and the consequent initial
build-up of venous blood. These results suggest that hemoglobin
concentration changes can be extracted from PPG signals. Very
recently, Akl et al. reported results from an animal study in
which PPG signals were used for monitoring liver tissue. In
their work, a PPG probe was placed on the parenchymal tissue
of two swine and NIRS principles and multilinear regression
analysis were performed to track changes in perfusion and oxygenation [47]. The quantitative differences observed in our study
between the PPG-derived and NIRS-derived hemoglobins have
to be related to the different light penetration depths. While the
large LEDs-photodiode spacing in NIRS allows the deep penetration of light in tissues (approximately up to 2 cm) [25], [26],
the small separation distance in our reflectance PPG probe (i.e.,
5 mm) limits the penetration depth to only few millimeters in
the skin layers. The spacing employed in our reflectance PPG
probe has been chosen for the best acquisition of PPG signals
and as a tradeoff between the light intensities and photodetection
system. Another parameter affecting the light penetration depth
is the specific light wavelengths adopted to illuminate the tissues; the NIRS monitor adopted in this study employs LEDs at
nominal wavelengths of 735, 810, and 850 nm, in contrast with
the 660/880 nm pair used in our PPG reflectance probe. Thus,
the shallower light penetration of our reflectance, PPG probe
could be considered as the cause for lower SpO2 values estimated from the forearm. The PPG signal detected by our probe
is likely to originate from capillaries structures within the skin.
As capillaries contain a mixture of arterial and venous blood,

2194

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 9, SEPTEMBER 2015

the calculated SpO2 values have lower values compared with
fingers. Furthermore, the decrease of SpO2 from the forearm
during venous occlusion may be caused by the shifting of arterial/venous blood ratio in capillaries due to venous congestion.
However, superficial layers (skin) and deep tissue (brachioradialis) share the same major arteries and veins; hence, occlusions of these vessels produce changes in blood perfusion in
both compartments. Furthermore, monitoring skin circulation,
which serves as a blood reservoir and has a weaker autoregulation, can be used as an early indicator of changes in blood
perfusion in more internal organs [2], [48]. Although myoglobin
and hemoglobin in muscles cannot be distinguished when measured by NIRS [26], we decided to express the NIRS parameters
as “only hemoglobin” changes.
The rate of increase in HHb, or the decrease rate of HbO2 ,
measured by NIRS during venous or total occlusions have been
used as indicators of oxygen consumption [27], [28], [49].
Therefore, the values in Table II may be used as comparative
indicators of oxygen consumption. In particular, the part of tissue interrogated by our PPG probe (i.e., skin) appears to have a
lower consumption rate when compared with tissues measured
by NIRS (i.e., muscle). These differences in metabolic rate are
in agreement with physiology tables on oxygen consumption of
various human body tissues [50].
Future work will focus on the improvement of the PPG
reflectance probe, for instance, the placement of the LEDs,
in order to achieve a more homogeneous interrogation of
volume of tissue. In addition, the probe could be further
miniaturized.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we explored the capabilities of a PPG system in providing additional information, when compared with
conventional PPG, on changes in blood perfusion during vascular occlusions. The system estimated arterial blood oxygen
saturation as a conventional pulse oximeter and it applied the
Beer–Lambert law for the estimation of changes of concentration of HHb, HbO2 , and tHb. The evaluation of the system in
healthy volunteers demonstrated that hemoglobins concentration changes estimated from PPG could be a valuable additional
tool for the assessment of blood perfusion. The promising comparative results with the NIRS system showed that the PPG
boundaries might be effectively extended to NIRS.
