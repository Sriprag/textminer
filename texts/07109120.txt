Abstract—Widely used medical imaging systems in clinics currently rely on X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound,
computed tomography, and positron emission tomography. The
aforementioned technologies provide clinical data with a variety of
resolution, implementation cost, and use complexity, where some
of them rely on ionizing radiation. Microwave sensing and imaging
(MSI) is an alternative method based on nonionizing electromagnetic (EM) signals operating over the frequency range covering
hundreds of megahertz to tens of gigahertz. The advantages of using EM signals are low health risk, low cost implementation, low
operational cost, ease of use, and user friendliness. Advancements
made in microelectronics, material science, and embedded systems
make it possible for miniaturization and integration into portable,
handheld, mobile devices with networking capability. MSI has been
used for tumor detection, blood clot/stroke detection, heart imaging, bone imaging, cancer detection, and localization of in-body
RF sources. The fundamental notion of MSI is that it exploits the
tissue-dependent dielectric contrast to reconstruct signals and images using radar-based or tomographic imaging techniques. This
paper presents a comprehensive overview of the active MSI for
various medical applications, for which the motivation, challenges,
possible solutions, and future directions are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
EDICAL imaging is an important tool for visualizing the
interior of the body for clinical analysis and identifying
any abnormality usually in a noninvasive way. It can be used
to investigate human anatomy and physiology for both healthy
and diseased cases. Medical imaging has been widely used in
all phases of cancer management [1], identifying bone fracture,

and tumors, to name a few applications. Medical imaging systems currently used in medical care facilities usually rely on
X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), and positron emission tomography
(PET). These different methods provide clinical data with a variety of resolution, implementation cost, and use complexity,
where some of them rely on ionizing radiation. For example,
MRI provides good resolution, but is an expensive procedure.
Further, internal body movements such as heartbeat can produce measurement artifacts in an MRI image. CT has a good
spatial resolution, but is less informative when it comes to imaging soft tissues [2]. Further, it uses X-rays that can ionize the
tissues, and hence, poses a health risk. PET can provide good
information on the soft tissues, but suffers from poor spatial
resolution [2]. Moreover, there may also be a chance of a false
alarm when using these imaging techniques for detection of tumor. For example, X-rays are used in mammography for breast
tumor detection where a high false negative rate (4 − 34%) and
high false positive rate (70%) have been reported [3]. Moreover,
due to less variation between the contrast of a tumor tissue and
healthy tissue at X-ray frequencies, detection becomes challenging. Furthermore, the systems based on these imaging methods
are usually not portable.
Using nonionizing electromagnetic (EM) waves at microwave
frequencies for sensing and imaging for medical diagnosis is
emerging as a low cost and low health risk alternative to the
aforementioned imaging technologies. Microwave sensing and
imaging (MSI) offers a noninvasive way for the diagnosis of
functional and pathological tissue conditions [2], [4]. Sensing applications of microwave involve single point applications
wherein microwave signals transmitted by an antenna are received by the same or a different antenna after reflection or
scattering by tissues. In such a case, no 2-D or 3-D images are
formed. Examples of such cases can be heartbeat detection or
changes in the microwave signal caused because of the pathological accumulation of water in the brain called cerebral edema
[5]. In the imaging applications, a map or an image either in 2-D
or 3-D is formed, that shows different tissue electrical properties
or the location of a strong scatterer that is usually a tumor inside
the body. MSI systems are usually portable and low cost, and
hence, can offer the initial diagnosis of various life threatening
conditions like brain strokes while patients are still being on the
way to a hospital in an ambulance [6]. The hardware of an MSI
system generally consists of a microwave signal transmitter and
a receiver such as a vector network analyzer, an antenna array,

and a radio-frequency switch that switches between different
antennas [7]. As mentioned by a commercial MSI company
EMTensor [8], such a hardware for MSI can be produced at a
fraction of the price of other diagnostic equipment, resulting
in a low cost of the MSI system. Low cost of the MSI system
can facilitate the diagnosis of patients in developing economies,
where other costly imaging modalities are out of reach of large
masses.
Feasibility studies and proof-of-concept of MSI for various
medical applications have been reported in the literature. Some
of the early work reported for MSI were by Larsen and Jacobi
[9] for imaging of perfused canine kidney. One of the limitations mentioned in their work was the long acquisition time of
the used setup. Further, this early work used intensity modulation of a raster scanned display to convert measured scattering
parameters into an image. Over the years, different data acquisition setup with linear arrangements of antennas [10] or
more faster cylindrical arrangements [11] were proposed. Apart
from the development of various reconstruction algorithms, MSI
has moved from simple imaging of organs to application specific imaging for various pathological conditions. To this end,
applications as respiration and heart-beat detection [12], [13],
imaging brain for strokes [4] and cerebral edema [5], breast cancer [14], bone imaging [15], [16], heart imaging [17]–[21], and
joint tissues [23], have been investigated. The working principle of the MSI is based on the difference between the electrical
properties (relative permittivity and conductivity) of different
tissues. A malignant tissue has usually different electrical properties than the surrounding normal and healthy tissues, which
can be differentiated in the image. As for imaging techniques,
both quantitative and qualitative imaging algorithms have been
developed. Quantitative imaging algorithms give a map or the
image of the distribution of the various tissues with the values of
electrical properties in the body. They are usually based on the
inverse scattering problem. On the other hand, qualitative imaging algorithms use radar like techniques for image generation
to differentiate the malignant tissues from the normal tissues
as the malignant tissues are usually strong scatterer than the
normal tissues. Initial clinical trials have been reported for MSI
systems, especially for breast cancer [7], [24], [25] and brain
stroke detection [6]. However, there are still many challenges,
which have to be overcome and require further research for MSI
systems to be practically implemented in a clinical setting. Currently, MSI systems face challenges both at system level like
the requirement of a high dynamic range system to successfully
measure weak scattering fields and also at the modeling level
like the requirement of 3-D computationally efficient imaging
algorithms which can model the effect of antennas, and feeding
network for large biological bodies [26]. Challenges still remain
open at experimental level where there is a need to efficiently
couple the microwave power to the biological tissues, proper
frequency for good resolution as well as penetration depth, and
development of suitable contrast agents [26].
The main objective of this paper is to present an exhaustive
literature review of the MSI for various medical applications that
may provide a comprehensive study material for researchers in
the field regarding current trend and future directions in MSI. It

should be noted that this paper focus on the active MSI where
the tissues are illuminated with microwave energy, unlike the
passive microwave imaging approach as used in thermography
[27]. This paper further discusses the principle behind medical
MSI techniques by highlighting various medical applications,
challenges, and possible solutions. It is arranged in following
order. Section II discusses the electrical properties of the tissues,
both normal and malignant, which is used as a basis for MSI
systems. Section III presents different imaging methods used for
MSI. Section IV provides an overview along with the imaging
results of various medical MSI applications. Open issues, challenges, and future directions are discussed in Section V. Finally,
Section VI concludes this paper.
II. ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF THE TISSUE
Different types of tissues, including both normal and malignant tissues of the same kind, have distinct electrical properties
(relative permittivity and conductivity). This difference, primarily due to differences in the water content [32], results in the
variation in the scattered field by different tissues, which is the
basis of MSI. An early review of the electrical properties of the
human tissues is presented in [28]. A summary of measurements
for various healthy tissues is provided by Gabriel et al. in [29].
The measured electrical properties of various healthy and the
malignant tissues from 50 − 900 MHz is presented in [30]. For
some tissues, the difference between the normal and the malignant tissue might be low. Further, the presence of multiple
tissues with different properties result in a complex scattering
environment. To solve these challenges, either use of a high
dynamic system is required to capture the small difference in
the scattered field or the use of contrast agents is proposed to
enhance the electrical properties of the malignant tissues (discussed later in Section V). Another challenge is the frequency
dispersion of electrical properties of the tissues that results in
the distortion of the wideband pulses used in the radar-based
imaging methods. To model the frequency dispersive nature of
the tissues, one can either use the Debye model or the Cole–
Cole model [31]. The attenuation of the microwave signal also
increases with the frequency due to increase in the conductivity resulting in a lower penetration depth. Hence, choice of
frequency is critical for imaging.
Apart from the difference in the water content in healthy
and malignant tissues [32], a variety of other factors have been
explored that explains the difference in electrical properties between healthy tissues and malignant tissues. These are necrosis
and inflammation causing breakdown of cell membrane [33],
charging of the cell membrane [34], change in the dielectric
relaxation time [35], and difference in the sodium content [33].
Fig. 1 shows the percentage change in the electrical properties
of the different malignant tissues (colon, kidney, liver, lung, and
breast) with respect to the healthy tissue from 50 to 900 MHz
based on the measurement data presented in [30]. As can be
seen from Fig. 1(a), the relative permittivity can either increase,
as for breast, colon, and liver, or can even decrease, as for lung
and kidney, for the malignant type. The increase was highest in
the case of breast, whereas for the kidney, low difference was

antennas. Usually this complete setup is immersed in a homogeneous medium with permittivity εb , which acts as a matching
medium for coupling the microwave energy transmitted to the
body, reducing any reflection that may have occurred at the air–
body interface in its absence. The body, that has to be imaged,
lies within a bounded domain D and the antennas are located
on measurement domain S as shown in Fig. 2. The microwave
tomography problem is generally formulated in terms of electric
fields. Three electric fields are defined for the purpose: the incident field Einc on D, the total field Etotal in D, and the scattered
field Escatt on S. A time-harmonic dependence exp(jωt) with
j 2 = −1, and ω = 2πf , where f is frequency, is assumed. The
scattered field on S is defined by the following data equation:

where p ∈ S, r , and r are position vectors. kb is the wavenumber of the matching medium, G is the Green’s function that has
a different expression for transverse magnetic (TM), transverse
electric (TE), or 3-D full vectorial case [44].
χ(r) is the contrast function containing the permittivity ε(r)
of the body and is defined as

measured. For the conductivity [see Fig. 1(b)], breast tissues
have the biggest difference and kidney have the least difference.
To this end, various research about the electrical properties difference between healthy and malignant tissue have been done,
especially for breast tissues [36]–[38], liver [39], lymph nodes
[40], skin [41] and bone [42], and heart for myocardial ischemia
and infarction [43].
III. IMAGING METHODS
Microwave sensing applications such as heartbeat, respiration, and vital signs sensing do not generate an image in the
traditional sense, but a graph between different parameters and
may be equivalent to sensor-based methods such as electrocardiography (ECG). As for 2-D and 3-D imaging both quantitative
and qualitative imaging algorithms have been developed. This
section provides an overview of such methods that are summarized in Table I highlighting their positive and negative aspects.
A. Quantitative Imaging
Quantitative imaging methods, also called microwave tomography, generates the image based on the values of electrical
properties, both the relative permittivity and the conductivity,
of various tissues of the body. The generated image shows how
tissues with different electrical properties are distributed inside
the body. The body to be imaged is surrounded by a number
of transmit and receive antennas. Each transmitter antenna illuminates the body with the microwave signal at a time and
the scattered signal by the body is collected by all the receive

(3)
The objective of the inverse scattering problem is to determine
χ(r) in D by solving (1) and (3) for known Einc and measured
Escatt on S. This inverse problem is ill posed. Further, the
dependence of Escatt on χ(r) is nonlinear, and hence, solving
it without iteration is computationally expensive. It should be
noted that this dependence can be made linear if Born or Rytov
approximation [45] is valid, which usually is the case when the
contrast between different tissues is low. However, this condition
is usually not valid in practical biomedical bodies due to a large
difference between the dielectric properties of the tissues [45].
Hence, a wide variety of iterative reconstruction algorithms have
been proposed [44]–[54]. Usually, the domain D is discretized
into N cells, where the contrast is assumed to be constant within
the cells and the algorithm estimates the contrast of these N
cells. These algorithms can be grouped into either Newton-type
iterative algorithms [44], [46]–[52] or modified gradient (MGM)
[53], [54] and contrast source inversion (CSI) [55] depending
upon the cost function used. The cost function for Newton-type
algorithms is of least-squares form

the data and the domain equations for a particular transmit antenna t, and Escatt
meas,t is the measured scattered field for that
transmit antenna. The cost function is minimized iteratively by
updating the contrast as χn +1 = χn + νn Δχn , νn being the
appropriate step length and Δχn being the correction at the nth
iteration. As the cost function is nonlinear in χ and is ill posed,
it is regularized before performing the minimization. A most
common regularization method is Tikhonov regularization [49].
Newton–Kontorovich [44], Gauss–Newton inversion [52], distorted Born iterative method [46], Levernberg–Marquadt [49],
and log-magnitude and phase reconstruction (LMPF) [51] are
some of the Newton-type algorithms that have been used for
microwave imaging of human body parts.
Though Newton-type algorithms converge in less number of
iterations, the data equation or the forward equation has to be
solved at each iteration resulting in high computational demand,
that may limit the applicability in a full 3-D vectorial case [55],
[56]. Hence, alternative to Newton-type algorithms, MGM and
CSI methods have been proposed without solving the forward
equation by formulating the cost function in terms of unknown
contrast and unknown contrast sources. The contrast source is

where GS and GD are Green function’s operator in S and D,
respectively. The minimization of the cost functional iteratively
constructs sequences of the contrast sources and the contrast.
At each iteration step, each sequence is updated, assuming the
other one as constant. The cost function is often multiplied by
a regularization term and the algorithm is called multiplicative
regularized contrast source inversion (MR-CSI). The MGM is
similar to CSI where the fields and the contrast is updated in
each step. Avoiding the forward problem in each iteration in CSI
and MGM leads to a large number of unknowns. Moreover, they
take a larger number of iterations to converge [57]. However, in
spite of these difficulties, MR-CSI has been shown to be computationally less demanding than the Newton-type algorithms
[55].
The reconstruction algorithms can be applied at a single frequency or at multiple frequencies in a frequency hopping manner [58]. Ignoring the frequency dispersion of the tissues, frequency hopping can be used to remove the artifacts, especially
in the conductivity where the data obtained at one frequency are
used as a starting point for the other frequency [59]. However,
as discussed earlier in Section II, the electrical properties of the
tissues have frequency dispersive nature, and hence, reconstruction algorithm that takes into account the frequency dispersion
by using the Debye Model in the contrast has been developed
in [60]. Time-domain instead of frequency-domain inversion
algorithm has also been developed [61] for a wideband pulse.

B. Qualitative Imaging
In some medical applications, such as breast tumor detection,
the aim of imaging is not to obtain the electrical properties of
the tissues, but to detect and localize the tumor. Hence, for such
cases, solving computationally intensive iterative quantitative
algorithms can be avoided. As discussed in Section II, the tumor
usually has higher dielectric properties than normal tissues that
makes it a strong scatterer. Various radar imaging algorithms can
then be used to focus the tumor, such as confocal microwave
imaging [3], beamforming [62], and tissue sensing adaptive
radar [63]. In these techniques, ultra-wideband (UWB) signal is
used to have a good time resolution. The setup is same as that
of the quantitative imaging as shown in Fig. 2. However, each
antenna transmits a short pulse at a time (UWB in frequency
domain) and the backscatter response is received by the same
antenna.
In the confocal microwave imaging, the backscatter response
consists of incident waveform, tumor backscatter, the scattered
signal from the skin, and other backscatter response known as
clutter from other tissues inside the body. Signal processing is
done to remove the scattered signal from the skin [3], [64] to
get the response from the tumor and the clutter. The processed
backscattered waveform at each of the antennas is integrated
over time to obtain Bt integrated waveforms, where t is the
number of the transmit antennas. The reconstructed image is
then created by time shifting and summing data points from
these integrated waveforms for each synthetic focal point r
in the imaged body. The intensity I(r) of a pixel in the image at r is the squares of the coherently summed values [3]:
I(r) =




2
ct Bt (τt (r)) , where τt (r) = 2|r − r t |/(VΔT )

t

is the time delay from the tth antenna at r t to the synthetic
focal point at r in the body. V is the propagation velocity of
the signal inside the body, assuming a homogeneous medium
and ct are weights to compensate for the radial spreading of
the cylindrical waves as it propagates outward from the transmit antenna. Similar to confocal approach, another algorithm
called tissue sensing adaptive radar (TSAR) [63] has also been
developed that assigns more weight to antennas closest to the
focal point. Further, TSAR algorithm includes compensation
term for the distance traveled within the body and spreading of
the waveform.
The time shifting and the summation of the backscattered
signal done in the confocal imaging may not compensate for
frequency-dependent propagation effects that are associated
with an UWB signal. Moreover, it has limited ability to discriminate against artifacts and noise [62]. Hence, microwave imaging
via space-time beamforming has been proposed [62], which can
spatially focus the backscattered signals to discriminate against
clutter and noise while compensating for frequency-dependent
propagation effects. To achieve the spatial focus, time shifting
of the received signal is done to align the backscattered signal
from a hypothesized scatterer at a probable location of the strong
scatterer. This time-aligned signals are then passed through

1671

a bank of finite-impulse response (FIR) filters, for each antenna location, whose weights are chosen using the least-square
method. This ensures that the components of the backscattered
signal originating from the probable strong scatterer location
passes the beamformer with unit gain while compensating for
the frequency-dependent propagation effect [62]. Further, the
beamformer output is time gated to the time interval that would
contain the backscattered signal from the probable strong scatterer location. The beamformer is scanned to different locations
inside the body by appropriately changing the time shifts, gating,
and FIR filter coefficients and the energy at each location is calculated [62]. The reconstructed image shows the backscattered
signal energy at different locations.
C. Sensing
One of the most commonly employed methods for microwave
sensing applications, especially for heartbeat and respiration
is based on the Doppler radar. In such a method, the radar
transmits the microwave signal of wavelength λ that is then
reflected by the moving human body parts as the chest wall. The
reflected signal is received by another antenna. The phase of the
reflected signal changes according to the Doppler theorem. The
change in the phase Δφ of the received signal at time t is related
to the displacement of the moving body x(t) and is given by
[13]: Δφ = 4πx(t)/λ. x(t) contains displacement both due to
heartbeat and respiration. Holding of breath may result in the
displacement, which is just due to the heartbeat. The heartbeat
signal can also be extracted by use of a low-pass filter that can
filter out high-frequency respiration signal.
Other sensing applications may involve sending microwave
signal from an antenna toward the body and recording the reflected or the transmitted signal from another or the same antenna. Due to changes in the electrical properties of the tissues
during pathological conditions, the reflected signal will be different from what it would be for a normal healthy case. Based
on this, pathological conditions can be detected. For such a purpose, usually an UWB radar is used as it can penetrate the body
and also have a good temporal resolution [65].
IV. APPLICATIONS
This section gives the overview of the different medical applications where MSI has been studied.
A. Medical Sensing Applications
1) Heartbeat Detection: Heartbeat extraction using the
Doppler radar is a common sensing application. The advantage of using the Doppler radar is that it is a noncontact method
leading to comfort of patients. In [12], the Doppler radar was
used at different frequencies, 2.4, 5.8, and 10 GHz, and different power levels for heartbeat extraction. In [13], a comparison
between different preprocessing methods for the demodulation
of the received signal using the data collected by the Doppler for
heartbeat and respiration monitoring is presented. Fig. 3 shows
the phase of the heartbeat signal obtained with the Doppler radar
with different preprocessing technique presented in [13]. The

ume. Similar to this principle, water accumulation in the body
using an UWB radar is presented in [68], where it was found that
the reflected signal from the bladder with water had different
received signal than without water.
A microwave stethoscope for monitoring vital signs and
changes in lung water content is presented in [69]. A coplanar
waveguide operating at 915 and 920 MHz was used to measure
the reflection coefficient on a phantom as well as on the humans.
From the measured reflection coefficient, various vital signs like
respiration rate, heart rate, and changes in the lung water content
was successfully extracted using signal processing techniques.
4) Brain Stroke: In [6], Persson et al. presented a working
prototype using microwaves in 0.3 − 3 GHz for detection of
the strokes for which clinical testing was done. It uses measured
scattered data of the different transmission channels for different
subjects with known conditions in a supervised learning-based
detection algorithm based on a subspace classifier method. The
algorithm was able to differentiate stroke patients from healthy
volunteers.
5) Brain Edema and Duct Obstruction: There are other sensing applications using radio-frequency-identification (RFID)
technology for monitoring of brain edema and duct obstruction [70]. However, these uses implanted self-sensing tags and
require invasive surgery. This paper focuses on noninvasive MSI
applications. Therefore, these are out of scope.

B. Brain Imaging
plot of the ECG that correlates well with the extracted heartbeat
is also shown.
2) Blood Flow and Pressure: Microwave sensing can also be
used for detection in changes of blood flow and blood pressure.
For example, in [66], it is shown that microwave sensing has
potential for detection of 0.3 − 0.5% changes in extremity blood
flow and about 2.5% change in elevated compartment pressure
using the experiments done on a pig’s hind leg. Changes in
the amplitude of the microwave signal at 2.5 GHz transmitted
through the pig’s thigh on reduction in the blood flow is shown
in Fig. 4. In [67], an experimental investigation is done on a
phantom and a human subject using an UWB radar to estimate
the radius and changes in the radius of the aorta that is related
to the blood pressure.
3) Fluid or Water Accumulation: Another sensing application is detection of fluid or water accumulation in various organs.
The detection and monitoring of cerebral edema are presented
in [5]. A head phantom was used that constitute of separate compartment of water and ethanol inside a glass sphere to stimulate
the head tissues (water for cerebral fluid and ethanol for brain
tissues). The microwave signal at 2.4 GHz from one side of the
head phantom was transmitted and received from the other side.
The received signal was compared with the reference signal.
The amplitude and phase of the received signal are related to
the variable amounts of excess water. It was found that 2◦ in
phase change was related to 10 ml of addition of water and 1◦
phase changes was related to 10 ml change in the ethanol vol-

The objective of brain imaging is to detect and locate the area
of the damaged brain tissues due to injuries or conditions such as
ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. These results in a blood clot or
a blood pool within the brain. Due to the difference between the
electrical properties of normal brain tissues and the blood, the
stroke can be detected using microwave imaging. Brain imaging
for stroke detection and monitoring is investigated in [4], [64],
[71]–[74]. Quantitative methods used so far includes a Newtontype iterative scheme for 2-D tomography [4], Born iterative
method [71], and a multiplicative regularized Gauss–Newton
inversion [75]. These investigations have been done numerically using a simple brain model with stroke as in [4], or on a
numerical anatomically real head phantom [71]. Further, they
have used single frequency in the range of 0.5 − 2.5 GHz. The
stroke can be observed in the reconstructed quantitative image
having different electrical properties than the normal brain tissues as can be seen in Fig. 5(b), where a 2-cm acute stroke area
in the image was successfully detected. The difference in the
contrast of the stroke with the normal brain tissues also makes
the stroke a significant scatterer, and hence, qualitative approach
as confocal imaging has shown to detect stroke [64], [72]. Confocal imaging of the brain in 1 − 4 GHz frequency band was
done on a physical head phantom in [72] using a microwave
imaging setup shown in Fig. 6. The stroke in the image obtained
through confocal imaging can be identified as a region having
significant backscattered energy as shown in Fig. 7. This method
detected an ellipsoid stroke of size 2 cm × 1 cm × 0.5 cm with
a localization accuracy within a few millimeters.

C. Breast Imaging
The objective of breast imaging is to detect breast cancer or
tumor. It is one of the most widely investigated medical applications of MSI. One of the reasons for this, as discussed in
Section II, is because of the relatively high contrast of the breast
tumor compared to the prominent fat tissue in a breast. Hence,
such a high contrast makes the breast tumor a significant scatterer where radar-based techniques can be effectively applied to
locate the tumor as reported in [3], [62], [63], and [76]–[82].
Moreover, the tomographic methods can also be used where the
tumor can be distinguished easily from the rest of the fat tissues
in the reconstructed image as discussed in [52] and [86]–[91].

A review of extensive research work done for breast cancer
imaging is provided in [14] and [92].
Different radar-based approaches that have been used for
breast imaging are confocal imaging [3], [78], [79], the TSAR
algorithm [25], [63], [80], space-time beamforming [81], and a
two-stage Capon beamforming called multistatic adaptive microwave imaging [82]. An UWB confocal algorithm is developed and investigated on a 2-D anatomically realistic MRIderived breast model [78, Fig. 8(a)]. It was extended to 3-D
cases in [3]. In [79], a signal processing technique called delaymultiply-and-sum is used with confocal imaging, where the
backscattered signals were time shifted, multiplied in pair, and
the products were summed to form a synthetic focal point. This
resulted in an improvement in the usual confocal imaging in
which just delay-and-sum of the backscattered signal is done.
The TSAR algorithm used in [63] for breast cancer detection
used simple tumor models using an experimental setup. In [80],
a signal processing algorithm based on the Bayesian estimator is used to enhance the tumor response in the TSAR data
by suppressing late-time clutter. Space-time beamforming in
[81] used experimental backscattered data of multilayer breast
phantoms for the tumor detection. A two-stage Capon beamforming called multistatic adaptive microwave imaging that has
higher resolution, and better noise and interference rejection
capability, is presented in [82] for an early breast cancer detection. These radar-based qualitative approaches used UWB,
3.1 − 10.6 GHz for confocal imaging in [3] and [78], 1 − 10
GHz for the TSAR algorithm in [63], and 1 − 11 GHz for the
space-time beamforming [81]. The detection of a tumor of size
as small as 2-mm diameter at a depth of 3.1 cm from the top
surface of the breast has been shown using 2-D confocal imaging [78] as shown in Fig. 8(b). However, using the 3-D confocal imaging, the detected tumor size was of 6-mm diameter

1674

[3]. The TSAR algorithm detected a tumor of size 1 cm [63],
whereas Bayesian estimator used with the TSAR algorithm
detected a smaller tumor of diameter 3 mm. There are other
radar-based approaches that do not aim to construct an image
of the breast with the scatterer or the tumor, but to present the
likelihood of the presence of a tumor [83], [84] or to classify
a lesion as benign or malignant [85]. In [83], tumor of size
2 mm is detected based on generalized likelihood test and in
[84], a 10-mm tumor is detected with a detection accuracy up to
92% with a support vector machine classifier, a machine learning classification algorithm. The work in [85] demonstrated that
characteristic morphological features of the lesion can be identified with relatively high rates up to 87% of correct classification.
Tomographic imaging approaches that have been used for
breast imaging are Newton-type iterative algorithms [86],
[87], Newton-type conjugate gradient method [88], the Gauss–
Newton reconstruction [89], the distorted Born iterative method
[90], and the CSI method [91]. These approaches reconstruct the
breast electrical properties where a tumor region can be identified by having an a priori knowledge of the electrical properties
of the tumor. Moreover, these approaches use different single
frequencies from 0.3 up to 5 GHz. A clinical prototype where
a Newton-type iterative algorithm was employed is reported in
[86]. The imaging was done on five volunteers using the prototype. Based on the measurement, it was found that the average
relative permittivity of the breast as a whole may correlate with
radiological breast density categorization. Other than this investigation that has been done on actual humans, the rest are
numerical investigations. For example, a feasibility study using
2-D breast models with the tumor using a Newton-type iterative
algorithm is done in [87] and using a Newton-type conjugate
gradient method in a numerical breast model is presented for
a 3-D case in [88]. An example of a reconstructed quantitative
image of a numerical breast model with a tumor of radius 4 mm
using the CSI method [91] is shown in Fig. 9.
Most of the breast cancer imaging setups use a cylindrical or
a hemispherical antenna array. A hemispherical measurement
setup is presented in [93] and an improved version of this setup
used for clinical trials is presented in [7]. However, the planar
configuration of the antenna arrays, where the breast is compressed between two planar arrays of the antennas, similarly to
that of X-ray mammography, has also been investigated in [3],
[94], and [95].

simple 2-D cylindrical model of the leg at 800 MHz. In [16],
microwave imaging at 1300 MHz using the Gauss–Newton iterative method with soft regularization was done to acquire 2-D
and 3-D images of the calcaneus bone of two patients. Their
one leg was immobilized for at least six weeks during recovery
from a lower leg injury. The reconstructed images are shown
in Fig. 10. A good correlation was observed between the recovered electrical properties of the injured calcaneus bone by
microwave imaging and the CT Hounsfield density measure.
Hence, microwave imaging of the bone can also help in determining the bone density for detection of osteoporosis [16].
E. Soft Tissues and Joint Imaging

D. Bone Imaging
Bone imaging using microwave has been done for applications like detecting the leukemia in the bone marrow [15], and
to determine the bone density for detection of osteoporosis [16].
Leukemia causes the cellular population in the bone to increase
that in turn increases the relative permittivity and decreases the
conductivity up to a factor of 2. Both of these applications require the electrical properties of the bone to be known, and thus,
the approach has to be quantitative. The possibility of using
Levenberg–Marquardt method for detection of the leukemia in
the bone marrow is discussed in [15], where the authors were
able to reconstruct the proliferated cells in the marrow using a

Microwave can image the soft tissues that might also get injured when bone fracture happens. The injured soft tissues are
not detected by the X-rays [2]. This is a challenging task as
the high dielectric contrast between bone and soft tissues may
obscure less pronounced contrast between soft tissue abnormality. In [66], a feasibility study using a Newton and the MR-CSI
method for functional imaging of the extremity soft tissues of a
pig’s hind leg is presented at 1 GHz.
A feasibility study of the TSAR technique [63] for imaging of the knee joint is presented in [23]. The objective was
to detect lesions of clinically relevant sizes and shapes in the
menisci, ligaments, and tendons in the knee. Both numerical

simulations and measurements were done, and data were collected in 50 MHz−13.51 GHz. Bovine patellar tendons were
used for measurements. Images were reconstructed with and
without the model of the meniscal tear in the knee. A tear thin
as 1.3 mm×8 mm was detected in the difference image (but not
in the reconstructed image) and two tears separated by a minimum distance of 9 mm were detected as illustrated in Fig. 11.
High permittivity lesions were simulated by inserting a small
water filled plastic plug in the tendon and a low permittivity
scar-tissue defect by inserting a material whose permittivity
varies from 48 to 27 in the measured frequency range. In this
case too, the differential image was able to detect the lesions. It
was concluded that since, the detection is based on the differential imaging, there might be a challenge to obtain the reference
image (for the healthy case), and hence, a more promising clinical application of this technique could be for monitoring and
healing of a lesion.
F. Heart Imaging
Heart imaging is done to detect any pathological conditions
as myocardial infarction [19] as the electrical properties of myocardial tissue have a strong dependence on coronary blood flow.
It can also be used to obtain the temporal images of a beating
heart for heartbeat extraction [22] due to millisecond temporal
resolution. However, the heart is located inside an anatomically
complex and highly electromagnetically scattering structure of
the thorax, that make microwave imaging of the heart a challenging task [2]. Moreover, there might be strong reflections
from the air-filled lungs that might make the detection of potentially weak field scattered by the heart challenging [20]. Hence,
heart imaging requires minimum SNR of 30 dB and a dynamic
range of 150 dB or more [20].
In [17], Semenov et al. reconstructed the quantitative images of an excised canine perfused heart in a static as well as
in a beating case using a modified Rytov approximations at
2.45 GHz. In [18], authors were able to successfully reconstruct
the internal structure of an excised canine heart including the
left and the right ventricles using the 3-D MGM, and in [19],
for the detection of the myocardial infarction. In [20], using
the same 3-D gradient method, authors were able to reconstruct
the heart in an intact swine at 0.9 GHz. Further, measurements
were done with and without the heart in the thorax, and it was
found that the presence of the heart changes the amplitude of

1675

EM field by 10 − 20% and a change of 7◦ − 10◦ in the phase
was observed.
An UWB radar-based approach to image the human heart in
real time is presented in [21] and [22]. An UWB switched array body-contact radar was used and a back-projection imaging
algorithm was used. The frequency utilized was 0.8 − 3 GHz.
The purpose of imaging was to obtain the heartbeat rate. Successive images were reconstructed of the beating heart of a male
subject with a frame rate of 25 Hz. Using the reconstructed image, heartbeat waveforms were extracted. It was concluded that
using this approach, different moving parts of the heart can be
observed and may provide the basis for an online diagnosis.
G. Thermal Therapy Monitoring
One of the ways to treat subcutaneous cancer of the soft tissue
is through thermal therapy using microwaves as in hyperthermia
[96] or thermal ablation [97]. These require temperature monitoring so that the temperature of the cancerous tissue is elevated
to a proper level for its destruction. The electrical properties of
the soft tissues are sensitive to the change in temperature primarily due to changes in the electrical properties of the water with
temperature. The change in electrical properties of the animal
liver tissue is reported with temperature in [98]. For example,
it was observed that the properties change approximately 1%
per ◦ C between 28 ◦ C and 53 ◦ C at 915 MHz. The idea of
microwave imaging for remote thermal sensing was used in an
early work [99]. This has been reconsidered in recent works
[100]–[102]. In [101], tomographic images over the frequency
range of 300 − 1000 MHz of the pig abdomen were generated
where the recovered conductivity was found to vary linearly
with the controlled temperature values. In [102], a real-time
microwave imaging system at 915 MHz to image differential
temperature based on the change in the electrical properties of
water with the goal of achieving noninvasive temperature monitoring of thermal therapy systems was developed, and tested
on a simple breast phantom. Hence, exploiting temperature sensitivity of the tissues, MSI can also be used for noninvasive
thermal therapy monitoring.
H. Miscellaneous Biomedical Body Imaging
There are many other studies that have been done for imaging
the biomedical bodies that does not fit into any aforementioned
applications. However, these shows the potential fields where
MSI can be utilized. Some of them are briefly summarized here.
The potential to image the human arm is shown using the CSI
method in [103]. In [104], the Newton–Kantorovich algorithm
is used to obtain a quantitative permittivity image of a numerical
human thorax and a real human arm at 434 MHz. In [105], the
author of this paper used the Levernerg–Marquadt method presented in [49] for imaging the human torso at the level of small
intestine in the 403.5-MHz MedRadio band. The reconstructed
image was then used as a basis for the localization of wireless
capsule endoscopes. Using this method, a localization accuracy within a centimeter was obtained. The possibility to image
the whole body using microwave imaging is shown in [106]
where measurements were done on a dog and a 3-D gradient

based iterative algorithm was used to invert the data. In [45],
comparisons between different quantitative image reconstruction methods are done on the experimental data of a phantom
and a pig’s hind leg in the frequency range 0.9 − 2.05 GHz.
These methods are Newton-based 2-D method and 3-D gradient method, and MR-CSI both for 2-D and 3-D cases. These
research shows the feasibility of imaging large biological bodies using quantitative approaches and opens up opportunities in
terms of several new application areas where MSI can be used.

applications have been mostly done through numerical simulations. The ultimate objective of any MSI system is to be used
in a clinical setting as a cost-effective alternative to the existing
sensing and imaging modalities. To meet this objective, the MSI
system should be developed beyond theory and simulations into
working prototypes that can be used for clinical trials. However,
there are many technical challenges and open topics that needs
to be solved before going for clinical trials providing the future
research directions for MSI. Some of them are discussed in this
section.

I. Summary of the Applications
Table II summarizes the various applications of MSI studied
in this paper. It mentions that the study in the literature was
done whether on the numerical (Num.) or the experimental data
(Exp.) and at what frequencies. Moreover, it also mentions that
if the experimental data were collected on human/animal and
whether clinical trials have been performed. Clinical trials are
initial testing of the MSI devices where prior approval has to
be taken from the health and ethical committee of the country
concerned. Moreover, many subjects either patients or healthy
volunteers participate after giving their written consent.
V. CHALLENGES, OPEN TOPICS, AND FUTURE
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
The previous section showed that MSI has many promising
medical applications. So far, the feasibility studies for many

A. Effective Coupling of Microwave Signal
For tomographic as well as sensing system, there is a challenge to effectively couple the transmitted microwave signal to
the body. Due to a high difference in the electrical properties
of the medium in which the antenna is placed and the body,
strong reflection occurs at the tissue-medium boundary, leaving
a weak signal to penetrate the body that is further attenuated by
the lossy tissues. This leaves very weak scattered signal to be
used for imaging and requires a system with very large dynamic
range [20], [26]. An approach to reduce the reflections is using
water as a coupling medium or matching medium. However,
water has high loss at imaging frequencies. A low loss coupling medium made of sodium metasilicate gel is proposed for
2.45 GHz in [107]. Similarly, development of a low loss coupling medium at other frequencies is required. Another method

CHANDRA et al.: ON THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN MICROWAVE MEDICAL SENSING AND IMAGING

1677

to reduce the loss and effectively couple the signal is to design
an antenna suitable in shape, size, and efficiency that could be
placed very close to the body. In [95], design of such an UWB
antenna is presented for breast cancer detection that can be
placed close to the body and can couple 90% of the microwave
power to the tissues.
B. Contrast Agents
A significant difference in the electrical properties of the malignant tissue and the healthy tissues of the same kind is used as
a basis for detection of such malignant tissues. However, if any
healthy tissue having a very small difference in the electrical
properties with this malignant tissue is present in a close proximity, microwave imaging may fail to distinguish between these
two kinds of tissues. As for example, there exist a large contrast between the breast cancerous and the healthy fatty tissues.
This difference is small when the cancerous tissue is compared
with the healthy glandular or the fibro-connective breast tissue
[36]. Hence, the detection of the cancerous tissue in a close
vicinity of the glandular tissue may be a challenging task with
microwave imaging. One of the methods proposed to tackle this
challenge is to use contrast agents that can enhance the contrast
of the cancerous tissue [108]–[111]. The idea is to administer
a contrast agent to the body by methods like intravenous injection. Some volume of the contrast agent will then reach and
bind the cancerous tissues enhancing their electrical properties.
In [108], a computational study using 3-D realistic numerical
breast phantoms is presented using assumed effects of two contrast agents, microbubbles and carbon nanotubes. Differential
imaging was done by taking the difference between the image
with and without the contrast agent effect and was concluded
that small tumors, even below the resolution limit of the tomography system, can be detected. In [109], a feasibility study is
done using microbubbles and single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNT) as contrast agents in an UWB breast imaging to classify a lesion as malignant or benign. This is done by analyzing
the complex natural resonances of the differential backscatter
responses before and after application of the contrast agents at
the suspicious site. Similarly, Mashal et al. [110] used carbon
nanotube for contrast enhancing of the breast tumors. It was
shown that 0.22% of SWCNTs concentration by weight can
increase the average relative permittivity by 37% and the conductivity by 81% of tissue mimicking material. The measured
enhancement in the contrast of the tissue mimicking material
is shown in Fig. 12 [110]. Use of magnetic nanoparticles as
the contrast agent is discussed in [111] for microwave breast
cancer imaging. The method is based on reconstruction of the
magnetic contrast induced by the magnetic nanoparticles using
the differential scattered signal obtained at the receive antenna
in the presence and the absence of the polarizing magnetic field.
These research have shown that the challenge of small contrast
between the cancerous tissue and any healthy tissue can be addressed, but there still remain several open challenges that need
to be addressed. For example, increasing the concentration level
of the contrast agents within the pathological tissues [26] as
only a low volume of contrast agent can reach the pathological

0.6 to 20 GHz [110].

tissues [111]. The contrast agent may also distort the lesion border profile that may be used in classification of lesions as benign
and malignant [109]. Hence, development of effective contrast
agents can be a possible future direction.
C. Imaging Algorithms
As discussed before, the quantitative microwave imaging algorithms are known to have inherit challenges of an inverse
problem like the nonlinearity and the ill posedness. Though
several methods have been proposed to attack the problem [45],
they still suffer from several limitations. For example, oscillations occur in the estimated electrical properties at the boundary of the high dielectric contrast tissues with both Newton
and MR-CSI methods though employing different regularization methods [45]. It was suggested that an adaptive-density
grid and regularization schemes for both the EM field and the
electrical properties might overcome this problem [45]. Moreover, a 2-D-based imaging algorithm may not work for a 3-D
biological object, and 3-D imaging algorithms are computationally demanding. Moreover, as listed in Table I, each of the
imaging algorithms has its own limitations. Selecting a particular algorithm for a given application, depends upon available
computational resources. Hence, further in-depth studies are required for development of a computationally efficient and more
accurate inversion algorithm. Adoption of the algorithm for parallel computing can reduce the time complexity to some extent
[45].
D. Signal Processing
For sensing applications as the heartbeat detection, removal
of the motion and respiration artifacts of a patient, and the
background clutter remains an open challenge to effectively
extract the heartbeat from the reflected signal [13]. Hence, a
robust signal processing algorithm is required for such cases
to remove such artifacts from the received signal. Moreover,
qualitative imaging approaches use backscattered data for breast
tumor or brain stroke detection. In such cases, signal processing
is required to remove the skin backscatter and late time clutter
response to effectively focus the tumor or the stroke. Toward this
end, some signal processing algorithms have been developed to
tackle skin reflections [64] and clutter response [80].

1678

E. Antennas and Measurement System
To relax the nonuniqueness and the ill posedness of nonlinear inverse problems to some extent, large number of antennas
have to be used so that the scattered field dataset from which
the electrical properties are retrieved is large [49]. However, the
number of antennas that can be used is limited by their finite
size. Moreover, placing the antennas too close to each other may
result in high mutual coupling between the antennas introducing error in the measured scattered field. Other errors that might
get introduced in a measurement setup are cable losses, phase
shifts, or mismatch at the connectors [112]. Further, it is the
electric field that is required in the inversion, and using a vectornetwork-analyzer-based measurement system would measure
the path-gain between the transmit and the receive antennas.
Hence, calibration of the measured data is required. A calibration process to remove some of these errors is suggested in [112]
and [113]. Further, Gilmore et al. [112] provided a method to
avoid the frequencies where the coupling is large enough to
prevent successful imaging in a wideband measurement setup.
Another method to avoid coupling is to use a virtual array to scan
the body, but at a cost of increased scan time. Therefore, the design of a measurement setup having an optimum scan time, low
error, and also a better antenna design having a minimal mutual
coupling can be a future research direction. Moreover, further
research on effective calibration methods of the measured data
is also needed.
The error may also occur in the EM system model for the
nonlinear optimization problem due to the presence of nonactive antennas if a fixed antenna array is used for microwave
imaging. Typically, the perturbations caused in the scattering
field due to the presence of these nonactive antennas are not
taken into account in the EM system model. Moreover, an error
may also get introduced due to the assumption of infinite matching medium. Hence, calibration methods as well as a proper
measurement system that introduces less error are required. A
compensation method for nonactive antennas is discussed in
[114]. A formulation that provides a way to compensate the perturbations resulting from the presence of an array of antennas
around the imaging body is proposed in [115]. Mojabi et al. in
[116] proposed a measurement setup using a rotatable conductive enclosure using a minimal antenna array. It is discussed that
such a setup will reduce errors due to the assumption of infinite
matching medium as the boundary conditions that can be easily
modeled. Moreover, lesser number of the antennas used in the
setup will further reduce any error because of the presence of
many nonactive antennas.
F. Frequency Band and Resolution
Another open issue in MSI is choosing a suitable imaging
frequency. As discussed in Section IV, different applications or
even for the same application, different frequencies have been
used. A choice of suitable frequency band is a tradeoff between
the penetration depth and the resolution. It is well known that the
penetration depth decreases with the frequency due to increased
attenuation in the tissues, however, the resolution increases with
the frequency. Moreover, a frequency used for imaging one

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 7, JULY 2015

body part may not be optimal for another body part due to
the difference in the size and the tissue compositions. Hence,
further investigations are required for developing a standard
with an optimum frequency and an acceptable resolution.
G. EM Interference and Noise
A clinical environment is an environment where EM interference abounds. Hence, using an MSI system in a clinical
environment is a challenging task as it will be susceptible to
EM interference and noise resulting in error in the measured
data. The sources of such interference and noise in a clinical
environment are RF emissions from wireless devices like mobile phones, medical telemetry, wireless local area network, and
other devices as radiology equipments, electrocautery equipments, fluorescent lights, and computers [117]. Further, noisy
electrical power supplies and grounding (earth), magnetic fields
(static and alternating), and surges (static discharge, lightning)
may also contribute to interference and noise in a medical facility [118]. Thus, the development of an MSI system that is
robust to these EM interference is required. Furthermore, the
MSI system must not be a source of interference to other wireless systems. It should follow the appropriate regulations and
standards set for medical devices.
H. Commercial Challenge
Apart from aforementioned technical challenges, one of the
nontechnical challenge that would be faced by the MSI systems to be embraced by clinician is competition from other
well-established imaging modalities like MRI, CT, or US. As
mentioned earlier, though the MSI system has advantages such
as low risk, mobility, time resolution, and cost effectiveness, it
lacks especially in spatial resolution compared to CT or MRI,
that may be desired for a clear interpretation of the reconstructed
images in some applications. However, in spite of these limitations, there have been start-up companies based on MSI technology as EMTensor [8] and Medfield Diagnostics [119] for stroke
diagnosis, and Micrima [120] for breast imaging, making a mark
in the medical imaging industry that has been so far dominated
by MRI or CT modalities. The success of such companies based
on MSI technology would certainly depend upon how well MSI
overcomes the technical as well as commercial challenges from
other well-established modalities.
I. Other Future Directions
Some of the other future research work will naturally follow
the ways and means to improve the signal excitation, detection,
and the reconstruction techniques to obtain high quality, low
noise signals, and images. In addition, novel approaches like
using multiple-input-multiple-output techniques can be considered for reducing the complexity of imaging systems [121] or
improving the image by increasing the signal to clutter ratio
when compared with a bistatic or a monostatic configuration
[122]. Moreover, 3-D reconstruction with temporal information
in real time will be useful for new applications like obtaining
temporal images of a beating heart.

CHANDRA et al.: ON THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN MICROWAVE MEDICAL SENSING AND IMAGING

Another direction that can be explored for MSI is compressive sensing. Compressive sensing is a method by which signals
can be reconstructed by sampling them at a rate much lower
than the Nyquist rate. However, for such a reconstruction, following criteria have to be met: “sparse” representation of the
unknown signal in some domain, and “incoherence” of the signal used for measurement with respect to the unknown signal.
Compressed sensing has been shown to substantially improve
the performance of ranging with an UWB medical radar in comparison with more the conventional methods in scenarios with
low signal-to-noise-ratio [123].
VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
MSI opens new opportunities in the field of medical imaging. MSI is shown to be low-risk due to the nonionizing EM
signal used, low-cost, portable, and have a good temporal resolution. This paper presented an exhaustive summary of various quantitative and qualitative imaging methods for medical
MSI. It was discussed that the physical basis of these quantitative and qualitative imaging methods is the difference in the
electrical properties of different tissues. Quantitative methods
solve the ill-posed inverse EM problem through different iterative schemes to minimize the error between the measured and
the modeled scattered field to obtain the electrical properties.
Qualitative methods avoid solving ill-posed inverse problem by
using radar-based techniques, and can be used in cases where
the objective is the detection of the strong scatterer like the tumor. Various medical imaging applications using microwaves
for which proof-of-concept have been shown were discussed.
These applications include heartbeat, brain imaging for stroke
and edema detection, bone imaging for density measures, breast
cancer detection, heart imaging, and soft tissue imaging. Apart
from these applications, MSI has shown to work for anatomical
imaging of different body parts like arms, torso, and also full
body. The feasibility studies of MSI for these various applications shows the potential MSI has to be used as a low risk and a
low cost alternative to the currently used imaging modalities like
MRI and CT-scan. Successful initial clinical trials, especially
for breast cancer imaging and stroke detection using MSI have
been done. Commercial start-up companies using MSI technology like Micrima [120] (for breast cancer) and EMtensor [8]
and Medfield Diagnostics (for brain stroke) are involved in clinical studies. However, for many other applications as listed in
Table II, MSI is still far from maturity as many open challenges
remain that have to be addressed before MSI can be used in a
clinical setting. This paper discussed these open topics and gave
some insight on what could be the probable solutions and future
research directions for MSI.
