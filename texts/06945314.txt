Abstract—Platinum (Pt) is the most commonly used metal for
stimulating electrodes. This study aims to determine the amount of
charge that can be delivered without causing irreversible electrochemical reactions (charge injection capacity, Qin j ) of Pt macroelectrodes (geometric surface area >0.001 cm2 ) in vitro and in vivo
using voltage transient measurements. Pt macroelectrodes were
stimulated with biphasic charge-balanced cathodic-first constantcurrent pulses in phosphate buffered saline. Potential excursions
were measured (versus Ag/AgCl electrode) and used to determine
Qin j . The in vitro Qin j were compared to those measured in vivo following: acute and chronic implantation close to the retina; chronic
intracochlear implantation; and acute subdural implantation, in
the cat. Qin j increased with pulsewidth from 35 to 54 μC/cm2 for
respective pulse widths of 100 to 3200 μs per phase in vitro. Qin j
was significantly less in vivo. There was no significant difference in
Qin j between acutely (3.84 to 16.6 μC/cm2 with pulsewidths of 100
to 3200 μs) and chronically (6.99 to 15.8 μC/cm2 with pulsewidths
of 200 to 3200 μs) implanted suprachoroidal electrodes. Intracochlear Qin j was not different to suprachoroidal Qin j , while subdural Qin j was significantly less than the suprachoroidal Qin j (p
< 0.05). These results have important implications in providing
guidelines on Qin j for the safe use of Pt stimulating macroelectrodes and question the relevance of measuring Qin j in vivo using
voltage transients.

I. INTRODUCTION
LATINUM (Pt) is a noble metal that is commonly used as a
stimulating electrode material for neural prostheses. It has
been widely used clinically in cochlear implants [1], [2], retinal
prostheses [3]–[5], cortical implants [6]–[11], and for other experimental purposes [9]–[18]. Generally, charge injection into
neural tissue is achieved through a combination of several electrochemical reactions at the electrode-tissue interface. These
include capacitive double-layer charging, reversible Faradaic reactions, and irreversible Faradaic reactions [19]–[21]. The first

two mechanisms can inject charge without producing harmful
electrochemical products, while the latter method can cause
damage to surrounding tissues and to the stimulating electrode itself [19]. Electrolysis of water is one type of irreversible
Faradaic reaction of particular concern since it can lead to localized pH changes [20], [22], and the evolution of gases could
physically displace tissue [20]. Electrolysis of water can be
avoided by ensuring that the maximum cathodic (Em c ) and anodic potentials on the electrode, during electrical stimulation
stay within the “water window” [−0.6 to 0.9 V versus Ag/AgCl
for Pt electrodes in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)] [23], [24].
The amount of charge per unit area that can be delivered through
an electrode without causing water electrolysis is known as the
charge injection capacity (Qinj ). Dissolution of Pt is also irreversible and is a concern, as it can lead to the formation and
release of toxic products [25].
Qinj can be measured using voltage transients [23], [26], [27]
and is a function of several variables. It is dependent on the
geometry of the electrode with smaller electrodes tending to
have larger Qinj [21]. Also, the charge density on nonspherical
electrodes will be nonuniform with charge accumulating near
the edges or other sharp points, especially during phases such
as the stimulus pulse onset [28], [29]. Qinj has been found to increase with pulsewidth when measured in vitro and is dependent
on the conductivity and composition of the conducting media
and temperature [21], [30].
A reduction of in vivo Qinj compared to in vitro Qinj has been
observed in acutely and chronically implanted electrodes with
materials such as iridium oxide [31], [32], but this has not been
investigated using Pt electrodes. Biological media is different
to PBS since it contains many different electrolytes and organic
molecules. A decrease in ionic conductivity or obstruction to
the diffusion of counter ions can lead to a decrease of Qinj
in vivo [27]. Adsorption of proteins can inhibit Pt oxidation
and oxide reduction [33], [34]. The concentration of oxygen
in the physiological environment is lower than in PBS, and
this limits the contribution of oxygen reduction to Qinj in vivo
[33], [35]. Additionally, chronically implanted electrodes may
evoke a tissue response resulting in fibrosis, further altering the
electrode-tissue interface and affecting Qinj .
Several groups have estimated the electrochemical Qinj of
Pt in vitro, with the consensus that 100 to 150 μC/cm2 can
be delivered with 200 μs pulses [23], and that the maximum
charge that can be delivered by exhausting all reversible charge
injection mechanisms is 420 to 490 μC/cm2 [36] for Pt macroelectrodes (defined as electrodes with geometric surface area
greater than 0.001 cm2 ). Other groups have reported Qinj in the
range of 80 to 120 μC/cm2 [37]. Fine Pt powder (Pt black) can be

electroplated onto Pt electrodes to enhance the real surface area
[38] and this can increase Qinj [38], [39]. The real surface area
of Pt can also be increased by laser roughening [39], [40] which
increases Qinj ; however, the surface charge density will be less
uniform. Conversely, the real surface area can be decreased by
polishing the electrode, resulting in a decreased Qinj [23]. In this
paper, surface area always refers to the geometric surface area
unless specified otherwise, and references to charge density and
pulsewidth refer to the charge density or pulsewidth per phase,
respectively. The real surface area of smooth Pt foil is typically
1.4 times the geometric surface area [33], [41].
Since Qinj is dependent on a large number of variables, Qinj
should be determined for each application with a method that
closely mimics the conditions of the intended use. Our group
has developed a retinal prosthesis which is undergoing clinical
trials (NCT01603576). It uses disk-shaped Pt macroelectrodes
implanted in the suprachoroidal space behind the retina [42].
As different stimulation paradigms are investigated, a broad
range of stimulation parameters are likely to be used clinically. For example, perceptual responses to stimulation with
long pulsewidths may be investigated since it is well known
that increasing the duration of the pulsewidth decreases the current required to reach threshold [4], [43]–[47]. A decrease in
current threshold would therefore allow stimulators with lower
compliance voltage to be used. In the interests of patient safety,
it is vital to have boundaries on electrochemically safe stimulation parameters based on the Qinj , which can guide clinicians
and psychophysics investigators.
The in vitro Qinj limits of Pt determined by various groups
[23], [33], [36], [40] are commonly used as safety guidelines
in vivo although the effect of the differences in electrode geometry, pulsewidth, and the physiological environment on Qinj
have not been fully appreciated [48]–[54]. Similarly, the electrodes in our retinal prosthesis design have different geometries
to these prior studies, and the pulsewidths proposed for clinical
use are greater than those previously investigated. Additionally,
we are not aware of any studies where a systematic evaluation
of Qinj for Pt electrodes in vivo has been performed. This study
investigated the theoretical limits of Qinj in Pt macroelectrodes
with a range of clinically relevant pulsewidths using voltage
transient measurements. The Qinj of Pt was determined in vitro
and in vivo in a retinal prosthesis model following both acute
and chronic implantation in the suprachoroidal space of the eye.
The results obtained from acute suprachoroidal implantation
were additionally compared to the Qinj of subdural electrodes,
while the chronic suprachoroidal results were compared to the
Qinj measured in a chronically implanted intracochlear array,
as both subdural and cochlea prostheses employ Pt macroelectrodes.
II. METHOD
A. Electrode Preparation
Electrode arrays were fabricated in a similar fashion to the
clinical suprachoroidal retinal prostheses being developed by
our group [55], [56]. Insulated Pt-Ir wire (90%:10%) was
welded to 700-μm-diameter Pt disks punched from 0.05-mm-

thick smooth Pt foil (purity 99.95%, Goodfellow Cambridge,
U.K.). Disks were placed into a thin silicone sheet cast in-house
with 700-μm-diameter perforations. 50 μm of the outer edge
was covered by the silicone sheet resulting in an exposed geometric area of 2.83 × 10−3 cm2 with a recess of 50 μm. The
Pt wires, weld joints, and one face of the Pt disks were sealed
in silicone [see Fig. 1(a)]. Prior to each stimulation experiment,
electrode arrays were cleaned by ultrasonication for 10 min in
detergent (Pyroneg, Diversey Australia, NSW, Australia), twice
for 5 min in double distilled water, 5 min in 96% ethanol, 15 min
in isopropyl alcohol, 5 min in 96% ethanol, and twice more for
5 min in double distilled water. For in vivo studies electrode
arrays were also steam sterilized. Two similarly manufactured
arrays with two disk electrodes each were used for a subdural
implantation study.
A commercially manufactured Hybrid L14 (Cochlear Ltd.,
NSW, Australia) electrode array was used for intracochlear implantation [1]. The exposed geometric surface area of the intracochlear electrodes selected for this study was between 2.0 ×
10−3 and 2.3 × 10−3 cm2 .
B. Surgical Procedures
All animals were treated in accordance with the requirements
of the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital Animal Research
and Ethics Committee (Ethics Approval #10/206AB), the “Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for
scientific purposes” (2004), and the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals Act 1986 and amendments. Suprachoroidal electrode
implantation procedures were performed at the Royal Victorian
Eye and Ear Hospital by vitreoretinal surgeons based on previously published methods [55]. Briefly, healthy young adult felines were anesthetized with xylazine (Troy Laboratories, Australia, 2 mg/kg) and ketamine (Troy Laboratories, Australia,
20 mg/kg) subcutaneously. Surgical anaesthesia was maintained
with gaseous isofluorane (1% to 3%) in animals with chronic
implants (n = 2) and intravenous sodium pentobarbital (Troy
Laboratories, Australia, 10 to 30 mg/hr) for acute studies (n = 1).
Intravenous sodium pentobarbital was used during stimulation.
A lateral canthotomy was performed followed by a temporal
peritomy. A scleral wound was created parallel and 5-mm posterior to the limbus. A suprachoroidal pocket was dissected and
the electrode array inserted to a position near the area centralis.
The wound was repaired by sutures. Acute suprachoroidal stimulation was performed on one animal from 1 to 72 h after implantation (n = 18 electrodes). Suprachoroidal stimulation was
also performed on two other animals after a total implantation
period of three months (n = 10 electrodes).
For the subdural implantation study, a craniotomy was performed over the striate cortex and a small flap in the dura was
created. Two small electrode arrays, each with two disk electrodes, were inserted under the dura through the flap with the
disks facing the cortex. Cortical stimulation was performed in
one animal up to 2 h after implantation (n = 4 electrodes).
A separate animal was implanted with an intracochlear electrode array using the method described by Fallon et al. [57].
Stimulation was performed six months after implantation (n = 3

waveforms were measured periodically. In this example, the suprachoroidal potential transient measurement system is shown.

electrodes). Animals were overdosed with sodium pentobarbital
(150 mg) at the conclusion of experiments.
C. Stimulation Protocol
One disk electrode, not used for potential transient measurements, was selected for cyclic voltammetry (CV) to verify the
cleanliness of the electrode fabrication method and confirm
the range of the water window. The active electrode was cycled between −0.6 and 1.2 V (versus. Ag/AgCl in 3 M KCl,
CH instruments, USA) with a sweep rate of 50 mV/s (EA163,
eDAQ, Australia). CV was performed in PBS (0.1 M phosphate
buffer, 0.13-M NaCl, pH 7.4), and then in the suprachoroidal
space following acute implantation. The water window was determined by analyzing features of the CV waveform [58].
To determine Qinj , electrodes were stimulated with constantcurrent biphasic cathodic-first charge-balanced capacitivelycoupled (10 μF) pulses against a large Pt wire or needle counter
electrode using an in-house custom-built stimulator. In addition, the stimulating and return electrodes were shorted at the
end of each pulse and remained shorted until the next pulse,
to ensure less than 100 nA net direct current and minimal irreversible reactions [59]. The interphase gap was 25 μs during
which the electrodes were open circuit. Pulsewidths ranged from
100 to 3200 μs. The waveforms of five pulses of the stimulation
current and the working electrode potential (versus. Ag/AgCl)
were recorded (PXI-4072, National Instruments, USA) after the
voltage transient had reached steady state.
Em c can be measured by subtracting the access voltage
from the most negative potential of the voltage waveform
[see Fig. 1(b)]. However, distinguishing the access voltage from
the interface polarization was found to be difficult in vivo. Thus,
we used a more robust approach in which Em c was measured
as the potential near the end of the interphase gap, 20 μs after
the end of the cathodic phase [35], [60]. It is important to note
that the measured working electrode potential lags the actual

working electrode potential, and that following the sudden voltage change at the cathodic phase offset, the measured working
electrode potential exponentially approaches the actual potential. The time constant is greater in environments with significant
permittivity, such as in vivo. By measuring Em c with a 20 μs
delay after the cathodic phase offset, the difference in the measured and actual Em c is minimized. Measuring Em c using the
potential near the end of the interphase gap or by subtracting
the access voltage from the most negative potential produced
similar results in vitro.
A salt bridge on the surface of the exposed skull was used to
connect the Ag/AgCl reference electrode in vivo [see Fig. 1(c)].
Moving the position of the reference electrode to different areas
of the animal in vivo had minimal effect on the measured Em c .
The use of Ag/AgCl reference electrodes in vivo to measure
the working electrode potential has previously been described
[32], [60]. Note that the effect of distance between working
microelectrodes and the reference electrode has minimal effect
on measurements (personal communication).
Charge injection can cause tissue damage in several ways.
Physiologically safe stimulation must operate within the water
window. In the present study, Qinj is defined as the charge density that causes the working electrode potential to reach the water
window limits. This is a widely accepted method of measuring
Qinj in vitro [23], [30], [35], [37], [40], [61]–[65] or in vivo [27],
[32], [60], [66]. In the present study, each electrode was stimulated with a current amplitude that was empirically determined
for each pulsewidth such that Em c was approximately −0.6 V
(the lower limit of the water window). The corresponding charge
density was recorded as Qinj . The pulse rate was chosen such
that the interpulse potential did not deviate by more than 100 mV
from the open-circuit potential. This was 4 pulses/s in vitro, and
100 pulses/s in vivo. Electrodes were stimulated for 15 min,
and waveforms were measured every 5 min in vivo to ensure
that the electrode voltage waveform had reached a steady state.
Because stimulus induced electrode corrosion is more apparent

in vitro [68], electrodes were only stimulated for 5 min, and
waveforms were measured every minute in vitro. Waveforms
typically stabilized within seconds of stimulation. For in vitro
testing, electrodes (n = 7) were tested in PBS maintained at
37 °C. Disk electrode arrays were soaked in PBS prior to in
vitro stimulation and inspected to ensure that no air bubbles
adhered to the electrode array surface.
The in vitro Qinj at different pulsewidths were compared with
a one-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni correction.
In vitro Qinj was compared with the in vivo Qinj . Differences in
chronic and acute suprachoroidal Qinj were tested with a twoway analysis of variance. Intracochlear and subdural electrodes
were stimulated only using a 400-μs pulsewidth and the Qinj was
compared with the suprachoroidal Qinj . Differences between
suprachoroidal, intracochlear ,and subdural Qinj were tested
with a one-way analysis of variance.
III. RESULTS
CV tests using our Pt electrodes showed that water electrolysis did not occur at potentials between −0.6 and 0.9 V in vivo
and in vitro [see Fig. 2]. The in vitro CV current was more
negative at potentials less than 0.15 V, presumably due to the
reduction of oxygen.
Potential transients were recorded [see Fig. 3] and used to
determine Qinj . There was negligible variation between measurements taken after 1 and 5 min of pulsing in vitro and
also between measurements taken 5 and 15 min of pulsing
in vivo. Qinj increased with pulsewidth and, in vitro, was 34
to 54 μC/cm2 with 100 to 3200-μs pulsewidths (n = 7) [see
Fig. 4]. The Qinj of 3200-μs pulses were significantly different
to all other pulsewidths, 1600 μs pulses were different to all
other pulsewidths except for 800 μs pulses, and 800 μs pulses
were different to 100 μs pulses (one-way analysis of variance, p
< 0.05).The interpulse potential (potential of the working electrode between pulses) was 89 ± 6 mV (mean ± standard error;
n = 41). The maximum anodic potential did not exceed 0.9 V
in any case.
The suprachoroidal Qinj in vivo was significantly less than
the Qinj determined in vitro [see Figs. 3, 4]. The mean

suprachoroidal space, acutely implanted subdurally and chronically implanted
in the cochlea. Measurements taken after 1 min (gray) and 5 min (black) of
pulsing in vitro and 5 min (gray) and 15 min (black) of pulsing in vivo are
shown. Em c is −0.6 V as indicated by arrows unless labeled otherwise. Current
waveforms were not recorded during intracochlear stimulation. Each panel was
recorded using a different electrode. Note the black and gray waveforms are

suprachoroidal Qinj in vivo was between 8.7 times less (200μs pulsewidth) and 3.2 times less (3200-μs pulsewidth) than
that measured in vitro. These factors were determined by dividing the in vitro Qinj by the mean in vivo Qinj at the respective pulsewidths. The mean suprachoroidal Qinj in the
acutely implanted animals was between 3.84 to 16.6 μC/cm2 for
pulsewidths of 100 to 3200 μs (n = 18). In chronically implanted
animals, suprachoroidal Qinj was between 6.99 to 15.8 μC/cm2
for pulsewidths of 200 to 3200 μs (n = 10). There was no difference between acute and chronic suprachoroidal Qinj but there
was a significant difference between all pulsewidths (two-way
analysis of variance, p < 0.05).
With a pulsewidth of 400 μs, the mean (± standard error)
intracochlear Qinj was 10.8 ± 0.5 μC/cm2 (n = 3) [see Figs. 3,
4]. This was not significantly different to the Qinj of chronically
implanted suprachoroidal electrodes with a 400-μs pulse. The
mean (± standard error) cortical Qinj was 4.63 ± 0.04 μC/cm2 (n
= 4) with a pulsewidth of 400 μs, which is significantly less than
the Qinj of acutely implanted electrodes in the suprachoroidal
space (one-way analysis of variance, p = 0.002). The cortical Qinj was also significantly less than the intracochlear Qinj
(p = 0.001).
IV. DISCUSSION
We have determined the electrochemical Qinj for Pt using
pulsewidths between 200 and 3200 μs by measuring the charge
density when Emc was at the lower limit of the water window
(−0.6 V). The results demonstrated that the in vitro Qinj was up

to 8.7 times greater than in vivo. As expected, in vitro Qinj was
lower compared to studies using smaller electrodes [37], [40].
Compared to this study, Rose and Robblee reported higher
Qinj in vitro with pulsewidths of 200 μs even though the electrodes were larger than those used in this study [23]. Rose and
Robblee stimulated electrodes at a rate of 50 pulses/s, which
is far greater than the 4 pulses/s used in the present study. Irreversible electrochemical reactions during the cathodic phase can
cause the interpulse potential to become more positive. Although
the interpulse potential will eventually return to the open-circuit
potential, successive pulses may cause a “ratcheting” effect,
leading to a more positive interpulse potential [19]. Higher pulse
rates allow less time for the interpulse potential to return to a
level that is closer to the open-circuit potential and this enhances the “ratcheting” effect and, thus, the value of Em c will
be less negative. This may lead to an overestimation of Qinj . In
this study, stimulation rates were selected to ensure that Em c
measurements were not significantly affected by drifts in interpulse potential.
Qinj increased with pulsewidth and this has been shown previously for iridium oxide [26], as well as Pt [62] electrodes. We
have shown that this dependence of Qinj on pulsewidth continues at pulsewidths >400 μs. Longer pulsewidths allow more
time for reactions such as hydrogen atom plating/stripping and
Pt oxidation/reduction to occur which results in an increased
Qinj compared to shorter pulse durations [23]. The contribution of oxygen reduction to the Qinj is also greater at longer
pulsewidths [35]. The dependence of Qinj on pulsewidth was
not observed by Brummer and Turner [36]. This is likely to be
due to differences in the way water electrolysis was identified.
Although Qinj can be increased by lengthening the pulsewidth,

853

caution is advised since the rate of Pt dissolution also increases
with pulsewidth [67]. However, Pt dissolution is inhibited by
protein [68] and decreases with time in vivo [69]. Also, no studies have investigated the chronic tissue response and electrode
stability following stimulation using long pulsewidths with Pt
electrodes. Furthermore, the effect of pulsewidth on Qinj may
vary with electrode geometry and the stimulation parameters.
The water window in vivo was found to be similar to that
found in vitro and was consistent with the established literature
[70], [71]. The suprachoroidal Qinj was only 11.5% to 30.8% of
Qinj in vitro. The Qinj of the cortical surface was approximately
12.7% of the Qinj in vitro with a 400-μs pulsewidth, which is a
similar reduction of Qinj in activated iridium oxide electrodes
implanted in the cortex [32]. A reduction in Qinj in vivo can be
expected due to differences between PBS and the physiological environment, including the presence of organic species and
differences in the electrolyte concentration [21]. The reduction
in the in vivo Qinj was greater at short pulsewidths compared
to long pulsewidths. The diffusion of counter ions in vivo may
be restricted by the presence of tissues [27]. This could reduce
Qinj in vivo, particularly at short pulsewidths when higher current densities are used.
The similarities in the chronic and acute suprachoroidal Qinj
concurs with previous reports that chronic implantation does
not damage Pt electrodes [72]. Furthermore, the results suggest
that differences in the acute and chronic tissue response did not
have a major impact on Qinj . A significant amount of fibrosis
is unlikely to have occurred during the acute stimulation period
of 1 to 72 h although a chronically implanted electrode array is
expected to be encapsulated in fibrotic tissue. However, recent
work has shown that the fibrosis around electrode arrays of the
same design, implanted for three months, was minimal [73].
Since the electrodes used in this study were recessed, the tissues
adjacent to the electrodes may not have been in contact with the
entire surface of the electrodes, particularly in the acute setting.
However, as there was minimal difference between chronic and
acute Qinj , the recess is likely to have had a minimal effect on
Qinj . There were minor variations in the acute and chronic tissue
resistances as illustrated by the difference in the access voltage
of the acute and chronic voltage transient [see Fig. 3]. Slight
intersubject variations are inherent in in vivo studies, which
may account for the differences in tissue resistance. However,
the access voltage is not included in the calculation of Em c and,
thus, does not contribute to Qinj [21].
The access voltage is typically calculated from the voltage
step of the voltage excursion waveform at the beginning or end
of cathodic or anodic phases. However, the voltage step of the
waveform at the beginning of the cathodic phase is larger than at
the end, as demonstrated in [see Fig. 3]. This was likely a result
of parasitic capacitance in the outputs of the stimulator, which is
typical of constant-current stimulators. In between stimulation
pulses, the parasitic capacitance in the stimulator is charged up to
supply voltage. At the stimulus onset, the entire supply voltage
is applied to the active electrode, which results in a voltage step
which is greater than the access voltage alone [74]. Em c was
measured during the interphase gap and, thus, calculation of the
access voltage was not required to determine Qinj .

854

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 62, NO. 3, MARCH 2015

The cathodic and anodic phases of the voltage waveforms are
slightly asymmetric [see Fig. 3]. The series capacitor accumulates charge during the cathodic phase and discharges during
the anodic phase. If the potential delivered by the capacitor during the anodic phase is greater than the sum of that required
to overcome the access resistance and deliver the desired current, the anodic and cathodic phases will be asymmetric. This is
especially evident at the beginning of the anodic phase, where
there is a voltage step that is greater than the expected access
voltage. At the anodic phase offset, the working and counter
electrodes are shorted allowing the capacitor to discharge and
causing the potential to return to the interpulse potential with
a larger step than would be expected from the access voltage
alone. The anodic phase waveform is not used to calculate Em c
and, thus, Qinj was not affected by the asymmetry.
The Qinj in the suprachoroidal space was not different to the
Qinj using intracochlear electrodes, but was greater than that
found on the cortical surface and this is likely due to differences
in the anatomy and physiology of each location. The intracochlear electrode is implanted into the scala tympani, which
is a fluid filled cavity where there may be less obstruction of
diffusing electrolytes and the degree of fibrosis is highly variable. Suprachoroidal electrodes face the choroid which is well
perfused and ensures a ready supply of electrolytes, although
the blood vessel walls may hinder its availability to the electrode
surface. This highlights the importance of understanding the effect of the implant location on Qinj and the need for in vivo
testing in a location which is similar to the intended application.
Qinj can be measured with methods other than voltage transients [33], [36] and this may produce different outcomes. For
example, the method for measuring Qinj used by Brummer and
Turner [36], [41] examined the voltage excursion waveform
shape. An asymptote in the waveform during the cathodic or
anodic phase was used to indicate the evolution of hydrogen
or oxygen, respectively. This asymptotic behaviour is not evident at the end of the cathodic phase in vivo and the slope
remains steep [see Fig. 3]. Thus, Qinj in vivo determined using
the method by Brummer and Turner may be higher than that
found in the present study. However, since the animals used in
this study were also part of separate studies where retinal and
cochlear pathology were important outcomes, determination of
Qinj with this method was not investigated.
Although we found that Qinj was very small in vivo,
histopathological examination of cochleae which were chronically stimulated with charge densities of up to 52 μC/cm2
with pulsewidths up to 200 μs showed no correlation between
charge density and damage to surrounding structures [75]–[78].
Similarly, acute cortical stimulation with a charge density of
40 μC/cm2 and a pulsewidth of 100 μs resulted in only mild
neural damage [9]. These charge densities are far greater than
those defined as Qinj in vivo in this study. Therefore, although
Qinj is sometimes used to define safe in vivo stimulation limits [79], [80], the clinical relevance of this measure, at least
determined using voltage transients, is questionable.
The polarization of electrodes beyond the water window
causes water electrolysis but tissue damage may not ensue. The
evolution of oxygen and hydrogen gas can physically damage

tissues if gas bubbles are formed. However, if the rate of gas production is not excessive, physical gassing may not occur since
the gasses can dissolve into the tissue [81], [82]. Electrolysis of
water produces OH− and H+ , and this may result in pH changes.
However, physiological pH buffers may minimize pH shifts and,
if both water oxidation and reduction occur, some H+ ions may
be neutralized by OH- ions [81]. By using charge balanced stimulation with capacitive coupling and electrode shorting, net pH
changes can be minimized [22]. It should be noted that the pH
close to the electrodes may change during the stimulation pulse
and this may cause tissue damage [66].
In the present study, we have adapted the predominantly in
vitro technique of using potential transients to measure Qinj to
the in vivo situation. Factors such as the permittivity of the tissue and positioning of the reference electrode may affect the
measured Qinj in vivo. Thus, the measured Qinj in vivo may
be less accurate compared with in vitro measurements. Further
investigation into the accuracy of measuring Qinj in vivo may
be necessary. Nonetheless, this method of determining Qinj is
standard practice for evaluating biomedical electrodes in vivo
[32], [60]. An alternative to measuring Qinj would be to perform
CV or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In order to determine practical guidelines on safe in vivo stimulation limits,
chronic stimulation in a suitable animal model will be the most
informative approach.
Measuring Qinj in vitro in a three-electrode model is a useful
tool for comparing different materials, geometries, or stimulation protocols. However, the composition of the electrolyte [30]
and differences in experimental setup can have significant effects on the findings. Thus, when comparing Qinj in vitro, the
experimental setup should be comparable. It may also be advantageous to use capacitive coupling [22] and shorting between
electrodes [59] to minimize residual direct current which could
otherwise lead to variations in Qinj depending on the equipment and protocols used. It is also important to remember that
findings using in vitro models may differ in vivo [21].
In summary, the in vitro Qinj of Pt macroelectrodes varied
from 34 to 54 μC/cm2 for pulsewidths of 100 to 3200 μs, increasing with pulsewidth. Qinj was reduced to 11.5% to 30.8%
of the in vitro levels when electrodes were placed in the suprachoroidal space acutely or chronically. There were significant
differences in Qinj when electrodes were placed on the cortical
surface but not the cochlea. The in vivo Qinj determined using voltage transients was found to significantly underestimate
the safe stimulation limits determined using histopathological
analysis found in the literature, possibly, because tissues can
tolerate a degree of water electrolysis. This suggests that an
alternative method for determining safe stimulation limits in
vivo is required. Ultimately, chronic stimulation and histological examination using the electrode array and stimulation site
for which the device is intended for is always required for the
most rigorous measure of safe charge injection limits.

Mohit N. Shivdasani migrated from India to Australia in 2003 to pursue a Master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering at La Trobe University. He then went
on to complete a Ph.D. degree in 2009 at the Bionics Institute, Melbourne on Auditory Brainstem Implants, devices that electrically stimulate the auditory
brainstem to restore hearing to deaf people who cannot benefit from a cochlear implant.
He is now part of a large multidisciplinary team
that developed a retinal prosthesis through Bionic
Vision Australia and played a major role in the preclinical testing of devices prior to clinical trials. Since the award of his PhD,
Dr Shivdasani has published 27 research papers including six as first author in
prestigious international scientific journals and has won seven awards including
the 2006 Young Biomedical Engineer Award presented by Engineers Australia.
