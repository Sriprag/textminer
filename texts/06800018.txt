Gaussian Scale Mixtures of Complex Wavelets
Lakshmi Srinivasan, Yothin Rakvongthai, and Soontorn Oraintara, Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—Microarray images when contaminated with noise
may severely affect the detection and quantification of gene expression. In this paper, we propose to use the complex Gaussian
scale mixture (CGSM) model in complex wavelet domain for noise
reduction in complementary DNA microarray images. Based on the
joint information in the red and green channel microarray images,
we model the complex wavelet coefficients of the channel images
jointly using the CGSM, and subsequently perform image denoising using Bayes least square estimator in complex wavelet domain.
The experimental results show that using the CGSM of complex
wavelet coefficients provides better noise reduction of microarray
images compared to other complex wavelet-based models.
Index Terms—Complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray image,
complex gaussian scale mixtures (CGSMs), complex wavelet transform, denoising.

I. INTRODUCTION
HE scientific world has witnessed an explosion in the development of comprehensive and high-throughput methods for molecular biology experimentation. High-density DNA
microarray technology allows researchers to monitor the expression levels of thousands of genes in an organism simultaneously,
to characterize genetic diseases at the molecular level, and to
direct new treatment for specific cellular aberrations [1]. Further details regarding microarray experiments and analysis can
be found in [2] and [3].
One of the important factors that complicate the feature extraction and analysis of microarray images is that they are contaminated with various types of noise contributed by biological
and experimental factors. The presence of noise causes inaccurate segmentation of spots, which in turn could lead to incorrect
estimation of the relative mean spot intensities and reduces the
reproducibility and validity of the gene expression levels derived from microarray images. Erroneous conclusions may result from ignoring or improperly treating the noisy microarray

images. Experimental noise can be subdivided into source noise
and detector noise. Source noise is generated during the fabrication and target labeling, whereas detector noise is generated
during the amplification and digitization stages. Examples of
source noise include discrete image artifacts in image such as
highly fluorescent dust particles, unattached dye, salt deposits
from evaporated solvents, fibers, and various airborne debris
[4]. Sources of detector noise during the course of experiment
are photon noise, electronic noise, laser light reflection, natural
fluorescence of the glass slide, and so on [5]. A major challenge
in DNA microarray analysis is to effectively dissociate actual
gene expression values from experimental noise [6].
A number of filtering and enhancement techniques for microarray imaging have been proposed. Several methods perform
denoising in pixel domain [4], [6]–[8], where noise is removed
by a filtering operation using information from the neighborhood of pixels. In [7], nonlinear filtering solutions based on
robust order statistics of the pixels are used to remove background and high-frequency noise by exploiting the correlation
in the microarray images. A similar method in [4] proposes the
use of arithmetic mean filter and the vector median filter for
noise suppression. In [9], a pixel-based approach is presented
in which possible microarray slide image is recreated with all
the genes removed. The estimate of background in the recreated image is subtracted from the original to calculate the gene
ratios with less influence from outliers and other artifacts. In
addition to pixel domain, there are studies on microarray image denoising in transform domain. Among various transforms,
wavelets [5], [10]–[12] and multiwavelets [13] are extensively
used for image denoising as they can efficiently process images
in more than one resolution and can also provide flexibility with
choice of basis function, which makes it particularly useful for
non-stationary signal analysis such as noise and transients. In
[5], a thresholding method is applied for microarray denoising using the stationary wavelet transform. However, there is a
concern for such an approach that its efficiency depends highly
on the choice of thresholding function. The method in [10] is
based on decomposing a noisy microarray image into wavelet
subbands, then applying a smoothing filter within each highest subband, and reconstructing the microarray image from the
modified wavelet coefficients. The smoothing filter exploits the
local coefficient variations in reducing noise. Another similar
approach is presented in [11], where one first decomposes the
signal by a multiresolution transform and then accounts for
both the multiscale correlation of the subband decompositions
and their heavy-tailed statistics. Recently, as compared to real
wavelets, complex wavelets have been more successful in image denoising due to its shift invariance property and improved

directional selectivity. As the two channel images are produced
from the same microarray slide, a significant noise correlation
between the microarray images is expected. The recent work
[12] exploits this property of interchannel signal and noise correlation between the two channel images in the complex wavelet
domain to achieve better denoising performance. The Gaussian
scale mixtures (GSM) model [14] of wavelet coefficients using Bayes least square (BLS) estimator has been very effective in noise reduction in natural images. To fully utilize complex wavelet coefficients, the complex Gaussian scale mixture
(CGSM) model has been developed as an extension of the GSM
for real wavelet coefficients [15]. The CGSM model of complex
wavelet coefficients improves the quality of denoised images
from using the GSM of real wavelet coefficients. It is worth noting that another approach that uses complex coefficient’s phase
more explicitly for image denoising has been proposed in [16].
Fig. 1 displays examples of noisy green-channel microarray
image and its corresponding denoised image.
In this study, we combine the advantages of using an improved CGSM model of the complex wavelet coefficients and
the existence of interchannel dependency between complex coefficients of the signal as well as the noise for denoising the red
and green channel images. Specifically, we propose to jointly
denoise the two channel microarray images by modeling the
complex coefficients of signal and noise using CGSM, and incorporating the joint statistics of the images into the model to
achieve better noise reduction performance. We use the dual tree
complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) [17], which is probably
one of the most widely used complex wavelet transforms in image processing. To validate the joint modeling for microarray
denoising, we compare the joint denoising of the two channel
images with independent denoising of these images using the
same CGSM model. Finally, we compare our proposed denoising method with other approaches, such as Bishrink [18], BLSGSM [14], the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)
and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators [12], to validate
the enhanced characteristics of the method for microarray image
denoising.
II. COMPLEX GAUSSIAN SCALE MIXTURES
The goal of this section is to briefly introduce the CGSM
model [15], which is used to model the complex wavelet coef-

ficients of signal and noise in microarray images. It exploits the
advantages of complex wavelets and the usefulness of the complex magnitude and phase and proposes an appropriate model to
handle complex random variables in the statistical framework.
Assume that the coefficients within each local neighborhood
around a reference coefficient in a complex subband are characterized by the CGSM model. A random vector Z is a CGSM
if and only if it can be expressed as a product of a zero-mean
Gaussian vector Z̃ and an independent positive scalar random
variable S as
√
(1)
Z = S Z̃.
The variable S is called the hidden multiplier. The vector Z is,
thus, a possibly infinite mixture of complex Gaussian vectors,
whose density is determined by the covariance matrix CZ̃ of
vector Z̃ and the mixing density, fS (s)

fZ (z) = fZ|S (z|s)fS (s)ds
(2)


(3)

where N is the dimensionality of Z and Z̃. We assume E{S} =
1, which implies CZ = CZ̃ . It has been shown in [15] that
the neighborhood random variables of complex subband coefficients of the complex transforms of images can be modeled as
a CGSM.
A. cDNA Denoising Using CGSM
The aim of this section is to discuss the application of the
CGSM model of complex coefficients for denoising the cDNA
microarray images.
Specifically, we extend the CGSM-based BLS estimator [15]
to include the joint statistics of the two channel microarray images and use it to denoise both the images simultaneously. For
this, we define the neighborhood structure to be subband coefficients in the chosen window around the reference from both
the images and augment it one below the other (different kinds
of window configurations used in this paper are discussed in
Section III-B and displayed in Fig. 3). As a result, the denoising neighborhood of each coefficient has twice the number of
neighborhood coefficients from each image. Also, the neighborhoods overlap causing each coefficient to be a member of
many neighborhoods. This minimizes the denoising artifacts
at the discontinuities caused by the neighborhood boundaries
[14]. Since the complex subband coefficients of the signal and
the noise of the two channels are correlated, using their joint
statistics in the estimation has potential to yield better denoising
performance than just denoising them separately. Let xr and
xg be the original red and green channel images in the pixel
domain. We assume these pixels are corrupted with correlated
additive white Gaussian noise. The noisy images are then given
by
yr = xr + nr

and

yg = xg + ng

(4)

where nr and ng are the noise samples of the red and green channels, which is i.i.d., zero mean bivariate Gaussian having equal

and a correlation coefficient of ρ . Decomposing
the images in (4) into transform domain subband coefficients
using a complex wavelet transform yields
Yr = Xr + Nr

and

Yg = Xg + Ng .

(5)

Let V be the random vector corresponding to a neighborhood
of N observed complex coefficients taken from each of red and
green channel images in (5), i.e., V = [VrT , VgT ]T , where Vr
and Vg are the observed neighborhood of N coefficients in the
window of the red Yr and green Yg channel subband images
respectively. Therefore, we can write
V =Z+W
where Z = [ZTr , ZTg ]T is an original complex coefficient vector
and W = [WrT , WgT ]T is a complex noise vector in the transform domain of the red and green channels. The noise vector
W is bivariate zero-mean complex Gaussian with a correlation coefficient of ρ. Using the CGSM model for the subband
coefficients, we can then write
√
(6)
V = S Z̃ + W
where S is the hidden multiplier for both the images, and the Z̃
is the zero mean complex Gaussian.
Let S1 and S2 be the hidden multipliers of the two channel
images when modeled independently by the CGSM. Fig. 2(a)
shows the conditional histogram of the estimates Ŝ1 given Ŝ2 ,
while Fig. 2(b) shows the conditional histogram of Ŝ given Ŝ1 .
These estimates Ŝ, Ŝ1 , and Ŝ2 were obtained by the maximum
likelihood estimator in each neighborhood.
It can be observed that Sˆ1 ≈ Sˆ2 and Ŝ ≈ Sˆ1 , which validates
our proposition that we can combine the coefficients from the
neighborhood of both the images and model them as a CGSM
with the same hidden multiplier S.
To estimate the denoised subband coefficients Z, the BLSs
estimator is the conditional expectation described as follows:

When conditioned on S and V, the conditional expectation
is obtained by the local Wiener estimate as
E[Z|V = v, S = s] = sCZ (sCZ + CW )−1 v

where the complex covariance matrices are given by CZ =

 H ] and CW = E[WWH ].
E[Z
The neighborhood noise covariance matrix CW is obtained
by decomposing two random noise images having the same
dimension as that of the original image into subbands. Each
of these random noise images have a Gaussian distribution with
mean zero and standard deviation σ with correlation coefficient
of ρ between them. The neighborhood includes corresponding
local neighborhood subband coefficients in the window taken
from both the images. This covariance matrix CW of augmented
neighborhood vectors is computed offline for various noise variance σ2 and correlation ρ over 100 iterations to get a consistent
estimate. Similarly, the observation covariance matrix CV is
also computed jointly. Given CW , the covariance matrix CZ
can be computed from the observation covariance matrix CV
Z
 H ] + E[WWH ] = E[S]C  + CW . Since
as, CV = E[S Z
Z
E[S] = 1, we have CZ = CV − CW . To force the complex
covariance matrix to be positive semidefinite, an eigenvalue
decomposition of CZ is performed and any possible negative
eigenvalues are set to zero.

on S is zero-mean complex Gaussian with covariance CV |S =

To estimate Z, fS |V (s|v) as in (7) is computed as follows:
fS |V (s|v) =  ∞
0

fV |S (v|s)fS (s)
fV |S (v|α)fS (α)dα

where we choose the prior fS (s) to be Jeffrey’s noninformative prior [19] for the experiments in this paper. Note that Jeffrey’s prior of the CGSM obtained herein is the same as that

1426

for the GSM obtained in [14]. Once we obtain the estimate of
Z, we extract the estimate of the center coefficients of both the
channel images computed jointly for each overlapping window
considered.
In summary, to denoise the subband coefficients of both the
images, we define the neighborhood to be the coefficients surrounding the center coefficient to be denoised from both the
images and feed the joint covariance matrix of the noise and
observed noisy coefficients in the complex wavelet domain to
the algorithm. This is effective as there are inherent correlations
between the noise and the signal of the two images.
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The goal of this section is to present results of the experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of cDNA microarray
denoising using the proposed method. In Experiment I, we vary
the window configuration to find the best local neighborhood
configuration for denoising the microarray images and in Experiment II, we compare seven methods of microarray image
denoising and also validate the efficiency of the joint denoising over independent denoising of these images using the same
CGSM model.
A. Experiment Setup
For denoising performance analysis, the original noise-free
images are needed. Since these are not available in practice, we
pick images that visually appear to be corrupted with very little
noise as the noise-free images. We use ten such pairs of two
channel microarray images downloaded from the website of the
Stanford Microarrray Database [20] and select them as similar
as what was described in [12]. These images are in 16-bit TIFF
format and are cropped to a size of 1024 × 1024. Noisy images
are then created by adding bivariate Gaussian noise with known
variance σ2 and correlation coefficient ρ to each of the selected
red and green channel images with four values of ρ (0, 0.25,
0.50, and 0.75) and three values of σ (800, 1200, and 1600). The
covariance matrix for each subband coefficients of the noise for
various combinations of σ and ρ is computed offline over 100
realizations. The performance of the noise reduction algorithm is
evaluated in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and
structural similarity (SSIM) index [21]. In this paper, the
√ PSNR
value (in dB) is defined as PSNR = 20 log10 (65 535/ MSE),
where MSE is the mean squared error. Both PSNR and SSIM
quantify the ability of the denoising algorithm to produce an
image as close to the original one.
B. Experiment I
First, we compare different types of window configuration
for the proposed joint CGSM-based method. The goal is to find
the optimum configuration of the window for denoising these
microarray images. To this end, we consider different combinations of window configuration both symmetric and asymmetric,
which are classified based on the number of coefficients used
from the two images. For the symmetric case, an equal number
of subband coefficients are taken from both the images, while

for the asymmetric case, they are different. As explained previously, the coefficients in the window are augmented one below
the other for denoising. For example, in joint denoising using
a 3×3 window, the nine coefficients of green channel subband
image are augmented below those of the red channel subband
image forming an 18×1 vector. For the (w5)&(w1) case, to
denoise the red channel image, five coefficients in plus-shaped
neighborhood of the red channel are combined with the center
coefficient of the green channel, thereby using six coefficients
to denoise the red channel image and vice versa for the green
channel image. Fig. 3 shows the different notations for window configurations used in this study. We consider six different window configurations for the proposed joint CGSM-based
denoising:
1) (w9)&(w9): 3×3 window of coefficients from both images.
2) (w5)&(w5): plus-shaped window(center, top, bottom, left
and right coefficients) from both images.
3) (w1)&(w1): center coefficient alone from both images.
4) (w9)&(w5): 3×3 window from image to be denoised and
plus-shaped window from other image.
5) (w9)&(w1): 3×3 window from image to be denoised and
center coefficient from other image.
6) (w5)&(w1): plus-shaped window from image to be denoised and center coefficient from other image.
Table I provides the PSNR and SSIM values for the joint
CGSM using different window configurations. As can be seen,
the joint window (w5)&(w1) configuration outperforms other
window types in terms of PSNR, and performs as comparably
as the joint window (w1)&(w1) configuration in terms of SSIM.
This hand-optimized window configuration is henceforth used
for our proposed joint algorithm. It can be seen that the PSNR
values decrease as we increase the window configuration for
either image This suggests that including more coefficients in
the neighborhood may add redundant information and might not
help in denoising.

C. Experiment II
1) Experiment II-A: First, we compare seven methods of
image denoising:
1) Bishrink [22]: The Bishrink method with the default window configuration of 3×3 (w9).
2) Separate-GSM Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT): The
GSM-based denoising method using the DWT of each
channel image independently with (w5) window.
3) Separate-GSM FS [14]: The GSM-based denoising
method using the real-valued full steerable (FS) transform
of each channel image independently with (w5) window.
4) Separate-CGSM DTCWT [15]: The CGSM-based denoising method in the DTCWT domain of each channel
image independently with (w5) window.
5) Joint-GSM DWT: The GSM-based denoising method in
the DWT domain using joint information from the two
channel images with (w5)&(w1) window for denoising
jointly.

6) Joint-GSM FS: The GSM-based denoising method in the
FS domain using joint information from the two channel
images with (w5)&(w1) window for denoising jointly.
7) Joint-CGSM DTCWT (Proposed): The CGSM-based denoising method in the DTCWT domain using joint information from the two channel images with (w5)&(w1)
window.
In each of these methods, the number of levels of decomposition and the neighborhood window configuration are chosen
such that they yield the best results. For the DWT, images are
decomposed with five levels, which is best for these images.
For the DTCWT, images are decomposed with five levels and
six orientations in each level, while, for the FS, images are decomposed with five levels and eight orientations. For all the
GSM/CGSM-based methods, which denoise the two channels
independently, the optimized window configuration is found to

be (w5). For the joint denoising schemes based on the GSM or
the CGSM, the window configuration (w5)&(w1) is found to be
the best.
Table II shows the output PSNR and SSIM values for the
seven denoising methods obtained by averaging the results of
ten microarray images. From these results, the following observations can be made. First, among the various methods, the
proposed joint CGSM model-based method outperforms its independent counterpart both in terms of PSNR and SSIM values
as it considers both intrasubband and interchannel dependency
between the complex wavelet coefficients while denoising. Second, as can be expected, the complex wavelets perform better
than the real wavelets in both separate and joint methods. This
is because the complex wavelets possess many properties that
are not present in the real-valued wavelets [17], [23] such as
the shift-invariance property of the magnitude, and the image’s

feature information contained in the phase of complex coefficients. Third, although the joint GSM method using the FS
yield results close to our proposed joint CGSM model, the complexity of our method is lower than that of the joint GSM with
the FS. In terms of transform’s redundancy, the redundancy ratio of DT-CWT is 4 while that of FS is approximately 18.67.
As a guide, the execution times in our current unoptimized
Matlab implementation are tabulated in Table III. From the
above rationales, it can be concluded that our proposed model
allows an efficient denoising algorithm with relatively low
complexity.
2) Experiment II-B: Moreover, we compare the denoising
performance of our proposed method with the linear LMMSE
and MAP estimators, which are recently presented in [12] for
microarray image denoising using complex wavelets. The methods are compared based on the improved PSNR with respect to
Bishrink (with DT-CWT) and separate BLS-GSM (with FS)

methods, where the values for the LMMSE and MAP methods
are calculated based on the results reported in [12]. Figs. 4(a)
and (b) illustrate the improved PSNR values with respect to the

Bishrink method, while Figs. 4(c) and (d) display the values
with respect to the BLS-GSM method.
From Fig. 4, our proposed method consistently performs better than the LMMSE and MAP methods in both channels based
on the improved PSNR with respect to both the Birshrink and
BLS-GSM methods. This is because the LMMSE and MAP
methods used only the magnitude while the proposed joint BLSCGSM method uses the complex coefficient in denoising. Also
they assume a different model by considering a Gaussian distribution for the magnitude of complex coefficients, while our
proposed method models the complex coefficients as a CGSM.
Moreover, they assume the equivalence between the magnitude
of observed subband coefficients and the sum of the magnitude
of complex coefficients of original signal and noise, which in
principle may not be true. Fig. 5 shows the 3-D visualization of
a clean spot, a noisy spot with noise of standard deviation σ =
1200 and ρ = 0, its denoised version using the LMMSE and
our proposed methods. As can be seen, our method removes
most of the noise and preserves the edge information of the
spots, while the spot appears smoother at the edges by using the
LMMSE method. Hence, these results suggest that our method
effectively preserves the signal information while reducing the
noise content in the images as desired.
The possible future research may include developing a microarray image denoising algorithm that directly enhances the
quality of the log-difference image, which is the difference image between the log intensities of the red and green channel

images. This log-difference image is used by biologists to extract information for further analysis. In this paper, the proposed
method aims at enhancing the quality of the red and green images. Another possible future work could be performing full
analysis on spot quantification and qualification in the denoised
images. Modifying the proposed algorithm for denoising the
log-difference image and performing spot quantification analysis could be investigated for further practicality improvement.
Noise in reality can be highly localized around the spots and
less localized on the glass, which makes the denoising task
more challenging in the real noisy case. In such a case, we have
to estimate the variance and interchannel correlation coefficient,
which are required parameters for the proposed denoising algorithm. Developing a method to estimate the variance and interchannel correlation coefficient from a real noisy microarray
image and also account for noise spatial variation could also be
one of future directions.
IV. CONCLUSION
We have developed a wavelet-based denoising method for
cDNA microarray images using the CGSM model of complex
wavelets. The proposed method utilizes the interchannel correlations between the red and green channels of microarray images.
Particularly, we model the complex wavelet coefficients in both
channels with the joint CGSM, and perform denoising using
BLS estimator. The simulation results suggest that using the

1430

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. 18, NO. 4, JULY 2014

joint statistics of both channels yields better denoising results
than using the statistics from the two channels separately. The
proposed method also outperforms recently published methods
for wavelet-based microarray image denoising that use only
magnitude information of complex coefficients.
