Omnidirectional Ultrasonic Powering for
Millimeter-Scale Implantable Devices
S. H. Song, A. Kim, Student Member, IEEE, and B. Ziaie∗ , Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—In addition to superior energy-conversion efficiency
at millimeter-scale dimensions, ultrasonic wireless powering offers
deeper penetration depth and omnidirectionality as compared to
the traditional inductive powering method. This makes ultrasound
an attractive candidate for powering deep-seated implantable medical devices. In this paper, we investigate ultrasonic powering of
millimeter-scale devices with specific emphasize on the output
power levels, efficiency, range, and omnidirectionality. Piezoelectric receivers 1 × 5 × 1 mm3 , 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 , and 2 × 4 × 2
mm3 in size are able to generate 2.48, 8.7, and 12.0 mW of electrical power, while irradiated at 1.15 and 2.3 MHz within FDA limits
for medical imaging (peak acoustic intensity of 720 mW/cm2 ). The
receivers have corresponding efficiencies of 0.4%, 1.7%, and 2.7%,
respectively, at 20-cm powering distance. Due to the form factor
and reflections from tissue–air boundaries, the output power stays
constant to within 92% when the angular positions of the transmitter and receiver are varied around a cylindrical shell.
Index Terms—Biomedical implants, omnidirectionality, ultrasonic powering, wireless powering.

I. INTRODUCTION
IRELESS inductive powering of implantable devices
has a long and celebrated history dating back to the pioneering work of Ko et al. at the Case Western Reserve University
in the 1970s [1]. This was followed by a period of rapid growth
culminating in its first commercial and clinical application in the
cochlear implants in the 1980s (the first cochlear implant was
approved by the FDA in 1984) [2]. Inductive powering offers
excellent efficiency if both the transmitter and the receiver coils
are similar in size, well aligned, and separated by a short distance (typically a few millimeters). This is the case in cochlear
implants in which the coils are 20–29 mm in diameter and are
separated by 4–10 mm, achieving a power transfer efficiency of
40% [3]. However, inductive powering becomes increasingly inefficient when used to power deeply implanted millimeter-scale
devices [4]. In addition, in such cases, any slight misalignment
causes a significant drop in the received power. Efforts have
been made to increase the efficiency by using a ferrite core
in the receiver inductor [5], [6] or a multicore configuration
in the transmitter [7], [8] and receiver [9]; however, achieving

as actuation, sensing, drug delivery, etc.

good quality factors from hand-wound millimeter-scale coils
and mounting several inductors in a 3-D configuration inside
a miniature package are nontrivial tasks (lithographically fabricated planar inductors have smaller quality factor than the
wire-wound ones; in addition, it is hard to integrate ferrite core
in such devices). Overall, despite numerous efforts, obtaining
efficient inductive powering at long distances using a small receiver coil has proven to be difficult [7], [10], [11].
Ultrasonic powering can overcome many of the abovementioned shortcomings (see Fig. 1). For example, ultrasonic waves
at 1–10-MHz frequency range propagate through the body with
relatively small dissipation and can be used to power deeply
seated miniature implants (body cavities surrounded by bones,
e.g., skull, or significant amount of air, e.g., lungs, pose a
challenge to ultrasonic powering; however, recent advances in
phased array ultrasonic technology and beam steering has allowed the creation of intracranial lesions using ultrasound without the need to remove the skull) [12]. In addition, due to large
acoustic mismatch between the soft tissue and air, reflected
waves at the boundaries will bounce back into the body and
allow for an increased efficiency and omnidirectionality.
Although this mode of powering is a promising approach
for millimeter-scale implantable devices, to date, only a limited number of investigations in this area have been reported
[13]–[19]. These have mostly used similar sized transmitters and
receivers (typically 10–50 mm in diameter) at <10 cm transmission distances. As such, the advantages of ultrasonic powering

as compared to the inductive method were not fully exploited.
More importantly, none of the previous work investigated the
effect of multiple reflections from tissue–air boundaries and
receiver geometrical design in efficiency and directionality.
In this paper, we investigate ultrasonic powering of
millimeter-scale devices with specific emphasize on output
power levels, efficiency, range, and omnidirectionality. After
discussing basic operational principal in Section II, we will describe our experimental setup in Section III followed by results
and discussion in Section IV. Finally, we conclude by summarizing our results and highlighting major contributions of this
work.
II. BASIC OPERATIONAL PRINCIPAL
A major goal in any powering scheme is to be able to provide adequate power to the receiver with highest possible efficiency. For ultrasonic powering, the classical Krimholtz, Leedom, and Matthae (KLM) equivalent circuit model [20], [21]
can be used to investigate input–output parameters as a function
of the electromechanical properties of the transducers. Fig. 2
illustrates such a model, showing a transmitter and a corresponding millimeter-scale receiver. For powering applications,
the input signal is usually continuous wave and the transmitter
is air-backed (modeled as a short circuit in the KLM model) in
order to reduce power loss through the back-face. The mechanical output from the transmitter, i.e., ultrasonic pressure (T), is
then radiated into the tissue and a portion of it is picked up by
the receiver. The ultrasonic wave is attenuated while passing
through the tissue; hence, receiver is impinged by αT, where α
is the attenuation factor due to the tissue loss.
In both the transmitter and receiver, the KLM model has mechanical and electrical ports, representing input and out electrical and mechanical energies entering and leaving the transducer.
In mechanical ports, the acoustic impedances due to the two
faces of the piezoelectric material (ZTransm itter and ZReceiver )
and matching layer (ZM L ) are modeled as quarter wavelength
transmission lines. Similarly, the acoustic impedances due to

Thevenin equivalent circuit representation of the receiver.

the tissue load at the transmitter and receiver are modeled as a
loss impedance (ZT , ZS ). In electrical ports, impedances due
to the electrodes and other reactive elements are modeled as capacitors (CT , CR ) and frequency-dependent admittances (XT ,
XR ). However, frequency-dependent admittances become zero
when the system operates at resonant frequency fr given by

where vD is the acoustic velocity in the piezoelectric material,

where ρ is the density of the material (piezoelectric transducers, matching layer, or tissue) and cD

impedance of

matching material is chosen to be ZM L = Z1 · Z2 (Z1 and Z2
are the acoustic impedances of the two media across the matching layer), while its thickness has to be a quarter wavelength at
the transducer operating frequency. The input electrical conversion to the mechanical output (or vice versa) is represented by

Assuming operation at the resonant frequency of the system,

as an ac source (Veq ) with an output impedance (Zout ) due to
the transducer capacitance CR (see Fig. 3) (ZL is the electrical
load impedance at the receiver, i.e., the implanted system that is
being powered) [22].
Using the above equations and the Thevenin equivalent
model, the output power delivered to the load can be given

where Pout is the electrical output power delivered to the load
and Pin is the input electrical power to the transmitter.
With Vin and T fixed to limit the radiated power within the
FDA regulation (720-mW/cm2 peak intensity [23], [24]), (7)
implies that the power transfer efficiency is determined by the
square of electromechanical transformer ratio φ2R and the receiver capacitance CR . Since both are linearly proportional to
the receiver area [see (3) and (5)], the efficiency increases linearly with the area.
In a typical wireless powering design, one tries to increase
the operation frequency in order to reduce the size of the receiver while staying within acceptable tissue loss levels. Ultrasonic imaging frequencies (1–10 MHz) offer an optimal
receiver size in the millimeter scale. Transmitter size is also set
and determined by practical and anatomical restrictions (2–5-cm
diameter).
Along with higher efficiency at small receiver size, a larger
penetration depth [25], and the availability of commercial instrumentation developed for imaging applications, another important advantageous aspect of the ultrasonic powering is its
omnidirectionality (i.e., angular misalignment insensitivity). As
mentioned before, with inductive powering achieving angular
alignment between the millimeter-scale receivers and the outside transmitter is very challenging. With ultrasound, the reduced effect of angular misalignments between the transmitter
and the receiver has been mentioned; however, a detailed study
on the topic is lacking [13], [16], [25], [26].
Fig. 4 shows the two factors contributing to the omnidirectionality in an ultrasonic powering system: (a) form factor and (b)
reflection from different boundaries. The optimal angular alignment is when the incident wave is parallel to the surface of the
receiver. However, even when there is an angular misalignment
between the two, the receiver could still generate output power
if its form factor is cubical symmetric (e.g., 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 ).
This is due to the fact that a portion of the wave hits the lateral sides of the receiver and generates power by vibrating the
cube in the longitudinal direction (piezoelectric constant relating the open-circuit output electric field to the input mechanical
stress perpendicular to the poling direction, g31 , is about half
of the case in which the mechanical stress is in the same direction as the poling vector, g33 ). The second factor contributing
to the omnidirectionality is the reflections of ultrasound at the
body/air interfaces due to the large acoustic mismatch at these
boundaries. Once the wave is launched into the body by the
transmitter, it reflects off of the body–air interfaces resulting

waves also cause displacement in the longitudinal plane (the planes without the
electrode and parallel to the polarization of the material, shown in red arrows).
(b) Reflections at the air–tissue boundaries bounces back the ultrasonic wave

in waves coming in from all angles as shown in Fig. 4(b). Although the waves would need to travel a large distance between
the body/air interfaces, in reality, multiple scatterings and reflections would occur at different interfaces such as fat/muscle,
bone/tissue, and others.
Another important factor limiting the amount of the received
power is the safety issues related to high-intensity ultrasound.
The bioeffects of ultrasound in various tissues have been extensively studied [23], [24], [27]–[29]. The bioeffect of the ultrasonic field can be classified into the thermal and nonthermal
effects [30]. The thermal effect, a dominant factor at the diagnostic ultrasonic intensities, causes the tissue to heat up (due to
the absorption). FDA regulations limit the peak intensity level
at 720 mW/cm2 for imaging applications [23], [24]. The power
levels are much higher in the therapeutic applications where the
ultrasonic field is used to elevate the tissue temperatures and
cause necrosis. Depending on the type of therapeutic applications, the acoustic intensities vary from 1 to 1000 W/cm2 [30].
Hyperthermia treatments normally utilize ultrasonic waves with
intensities comparable to the diagnostic ultrasonic, ∼1 W/cm2 ,
for a few minutes. In high-intensity focused ultrasound, the intensities are around ∼1000 W/cm2 and applied for only a few
seconds. At such high intensities, nonthermal effects of ultrasound such as cavitation becomes important [29]. Cavitation
occurs when the bubbles, which expand and shrink with the
acoustic wave, rapidly collapse generating high pressures and
temperatures [29]. However, such bioeffects are minimal in the
range of intensity that approved by FDA for imaging applications. Hence, it is important to keep the ultrasonic intensity
under FDA regulation for powering implantable microdevices.
The choice of the piezoelectric material for the transmitter
and receiver is dictated by various considerations. The most

important of them are: 1) electromechanical coupling coefficient; 2) biocompatibility; and 3) fabrication complexity.
The piezoelectric material in our experiments and most other
reported work is lead zirconate titanate (PZT). PZT is the
workhorse of medical imaging and has the highest electromechanical coupling coefficient among the commercially available
piezoelectric materials. PZT is available in various poling configurations and thicknesses down to 100 μm (f ∼ 23 MHz).
Although one can use various laboratory methods such as solgel deposition, sputtering, etc., to deposit PZT, the quality of
the films obtained through such techniques is typically poor. On
the issue of biocompatibility, the possibility of leaching lead
into the body has been a source of concern. However, the rate
of this process is very slow at body temperature and can be
significantly reduced by coating the PZT with a thin layer of
parylene. We have previously reported on an implantable microoxygen generator in which a parylene-coated PZT was used
as the ultrasonic receiver [19]. The devices were implanted for
a period of one month without any noticeable side effect on the
animals. Additionally, packaging PZT in a hard shell enclosure
(e.g., titanium) can effectively seal the material and prevent any
leaching; this approach was used in a cardiac pressure sensing
system developed by Remon Medical Inc. (these systems were
implanted in patients for several years) [31]. Table I summarizes various properties of PZT and geometrical dimensions of
the PZT transmitter and receivers used in this study.
III. EXPERIMENTS
The samples with three different dimensions were prepared
to study the geometric effect on the directionality and power
output levels. The PZT samples were diced to the desired dimensions (2 × 2 × 2, 2 × 4 × 2, and 1 × 5 × 1 mm3 ). Another set
of samples were prepared with a thin layer (<100 μm) of acrylic
(Poly(methyl methacrylate) coating (Loctite 3492). This was intended as a possible isolation layer to ameliorate the potential
of lead leaching from the PZT. Two transmitters were prepared
with two different thicknesses (1 and 2 mm) corresponding to

ultrasound frequencies of 2.3 and 1.15 MHz, respectively. The
transmitters were coated with a quarter wavelength impedancematching layer composed of iron oxide loaded epoxy (∼40%wt,
6.75 MRayl) [32], [33]. To ensure a minimum of intensity fluctuations associated with operation in the near-field, the dimensions
of the transmitters were selected so that the far-field, where the
intensity is relatively uniform, starts at around 20 cm [34]. The
far-field distance of a square transmitter, N, is approximately
given as

was low density polyethylene. The receivers were placed 20 cm

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To study the effect of receiver geometry on the output, the
transmitter was driven in a pulsed mode (150-ns width, 5-ns rise
time, 100 Hz) to suppress reflections from the chamber sidewalls
(in addition, an absorber was used in the opposing wall of the
tank to totally remove any reflection). The normalized power
outputs at different transverse and axial angles are plotted in
Fig. 6. The results on the left column are for the receivers without
any coating, while the right column shows devices that had a
thin (<100 μm) layer of PMMA. All three receivers displayed
similar responses with respect to changes in the axial rotations
[see Fig. 6(a) and (b)]. As can be seen the output was at its lowest
when axial rotation angle was 45° (∼10–30% of the maximum).
Also, the power was slightly lower when the incident wave
impinged upon the uncoated side (∼70–80% of the maximum).
In addition for the 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 receiver, the drop was not
as significant as for the others. This was due to symmetrical

uncoated PZT receivers and (b) the coated PZT receivers. The dashed vertical
lines denote the FDA limit of acoustic input (720 mW/cm2 ).

nature of this configuration and the fact that the receiving area
is relatively constant (the Poisson ratio compensates for the
difference in g33 and g31 constants).
Fig. 6(c) and (d) shows the normalized power output for
different transverse angular misalignments. The responses were
similar to the axial one for symmetric receiver (i.e., 2 × 2 ×
2 cm3 ); however, nonsymmetric receiver (i.e., 2 × 4 × 4 and
1 × 5 × 1 cm3 ) showed a compromised output power due to a
decreased receiving area. Note that the response of transverse
angular misalignments was investigated up to 50°; this was due
to the experiment setup limitations. The acrylic coating resulted
in lower power output due to the acoustic properties of the added
layer; however, the effect was rather minimal (average drop of
13% compared to noncoating).
In the above-described experiments, we used a nonreflecting boundary condition, i.e., the wave that was not captured
by the receiver was absorbed in the walls of the chamber. In
real applications, such waves will be reflected back into the
body at air/tissue interfaces, as mentioned previously. To investigate such effects, the transmitters were driven with continuous

sinusoid input at the receiver thickness resonant frequencies of
1.15 and 2.3 MHz, respectively, and the boundaries were allowed to reflect the wave back into the water tank. Fig. 7 shows
the normalized power output at various axial and transverse
angles. As can be seen, the output power remains relatively
constant.
As the results in Fig. 7 imply, the reflected ultrasonic waves
creates an omnidirectional field due to the acoustic impedance
mismatch between the water and the air. The reflection coefficient (Γreﬂection ) of such an interface is 0.99 (i.e., 99%) as
calculated from the following equation:
Γreﬂection =

(Zair − Zwater )2
(Zair + Zwater )2

(9)

where Zair and Zwater are the acoustic impedances of air and
water, respectively.
It was also confirmed that the omnidirectionality was not due
to the standing wave formation, as the power output showed
little variation as a function of the distance between the transmitter and receiver. Thus, the omnidirectionality was due to the
reflections and scatterings. This would be also applicable to human body, although reflections in human body will be difficult
to predict as the these occur at different types of tissues such as
muscle, fat, air-containing organs or bones (their acoustic properties are summarized in Table II), almost all of the ultrasonic
waves reaching the body/air interface will be reflected back into
the body due to the significant acoustic impedance mismatch
similar to the experiment setup.
Fig. 8 shows the I–V characteristic of the PZT receivers at
the 10 mW/cm2 of acoustic power input at 20-cm distance from
the transmitter. As expected, the receiving area and PZT thickness both play a role in the power output levels. The resulting
frequency change would also affect the penetration depth of the
ultrasonic wave in clinical settings. There would be a tradeoff between the thickness (dimension) of the receiver and the
working distance of the powering system. The receiver with the
largest area (2 × 4 × 2 mm3 ) generated the greatest power output. Of the two receivers with a similar surface area, the thicker
receiver (2 × 2 × 2 mm3 ) generated more power than the thinner

one (1 × 5 × 1 mm3 ). The effect of the acrylic coating resulted
in a slightly lower output power; however, the effect was rather
minimal (average drop of 4%); see Fig. 8(b)–(d).
Finally, the receiver outputs at different input acoustic power
levels were studied with a matched load. The values of the
matching resistances were determined from the I–V curves.
Fig. 9 shows the power output of different receivers at various input acoustic intensities. The receiver output, as expected,
showed a linear increase with the input acoustic intensity. At the
FDA limit for imaging applications, 720 mW/cm2 , the harnessed
power from 1 × 5 × 1, 2 × 2 × 2, and 2 × 4 × 2 mm3 receivers
were 2.48, 8.7, and 12.0 mW, respectively. The corresponding
efficiencies were 0.4%, 1.7%, and 2.7%. Table III compares
our experimental results to other reported work. While previous
works demonstrated ultrasonic powering in the range of 1–15cm penetration depth with some using identical centimeter-sized
transmitters and receivers [14], [16], [17], [26], this work presented the practicality of ultrasonic powering for implantable
biomedical devices with receiver dimensions in the millimeterscale. In addition, we showed omnidirectionality that can be
achieved due to multiple reflections from acoustically mismatched boundaries and geometrical factors in the receiver
structure.
V. CONCLUSION
Ultrasonic powering offers an excellent alternative to power
implantable medical devices where the location and the size
restrict the usage of battery or inductive powering. Ultrasonic
waves can propagate through body with relatively small attenuation, allowing one to transmit power to larger distances.
Moreover, at a small receiver size (∼mm), the efficiency of
the ultrasonic powering exceeds that of the inductive powering.
Another advantage of the ultrasonic powering is the omnidirectionality: to some extent due to the symmetric receiver geometry
(2 × 2 × 2 mm3 ) and to a larger extent due to the reflections at
the body/air interfaces. The PZT receivers with different geometries were examined to verify the omnidirectionality and
the realistic power level under the FDA limit of acoustic intensity. When allowing for boundary reflections, the receivers

SONG et al.: OMNIDIRECTIONAL ULTRASONIC POWERING FOR MILLIMETER-SCALE IMPLANTABLE DEVICES

were able to generate a few milliwatts of electrical power with
the matched load at 20 cm away without showing any significant misalignment sensitivity. A thin polymer coating seemed
to have marginal effect in the power output and can potentially
help dealing with the associated risk of lead leaching.
