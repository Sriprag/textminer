Improved Sensing Pulses for Increased Human Head
Depth Measurement Sensitivity With Electrical
Impedance Spectroscopy
Giorgio Bonmassar∗ , Senior Member, IEEE, and Michael H. Lev

Abstract—This paper describes an improved electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) stimulus paradigm, based on dual-energy
pulses using the stochastic Gabor function (SGF) that may more
sensitively assess deep brain tissue impedance than current singlepulse paradigms. The SGF is a uniformly distributed noise, modulated by a Gaussian envelope, with a wide-frequency spectrum representation regardless of the stimuli energy, and is least compact
in the sample frequency phase plane. Numerical results obtained
using a realistic human head model confirm that two sequential
SGF pulses at different energies can improve EIS depth sensitivity when used in a dual-energy subtraction scheme. Specifically,
although the two SGF pulses exhibit different tissue current distributions, they maintain the broadband sensing pulse characteristics
needed to generate all the frequencies of interest. Moreover, finitedifference time domain simulations show that this dual-energy excitation scheme is capable of reducing the amplitude of weighted
current densities surface directly underneath the electrodes by approximately 3 million times versus single stimulation pulses, while
maintaining an acceptable tissue conductivity distribution at depth.
This increased sensitivity for the detection of small, deep impedance
changes might be of value in potential future EIS applications, such
as the portable, point-of-care detection of deep brain hemorrhage
or infarction.

I. INTRODUCTION
N this paper, we show that a new type of pulse excitation,
the dual-energy pulse based on the stochastic Gabor function (SGF) [1], is optimal for electrical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) of deep brain parenchymal structures. Results from our
group and others have shown that EIS has potential applications in point-of-care testing for rapid, affordable, and portable

detection, assessment, and monitoring of patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), stroke [2]–[5], and other forms of acute
brain injury [6]–[8]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in situ blood
composed mainly of salt water and accounting for much of the
brain’s volume have baseline low resistance to current flow. The
edema associated with acute (nonhemorrhagic) tissue injury,
and the clot associated with acute ICH, cause complex—but distinguishable and localizable—frequency-dependent impedance
changes, proportional to the size and composition of the intracranial lesion [9].
Currently, there is no portable, noninvasive monitoring device
capable of detecting ischemic stroke, bleeding or rebleeding for
ICH patients. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are currently the first-line modalities for
the diagnosis of acute brain injury—including both hemorrhagic
and nonhemorrhagic lesions—but are limited in their battlefield
and sport field availability. Moreover, even when portable CT
scanners are available at forward unit hospitals, they remain a
limited resource with undependable technical support and few
contingency options for equipment breakdown, and cannot be
deployed by corpsmen in the field for emergent triage of individuals with (otherwise unapparent) subdural and epidural
hematomas.
Unfortunately, EIS is maximally sensitive to impedance
changes at the electrode–skin interface [9], and is relatively
insensitive to brain parenchymal changes due to the limited
penetration of the probe current. Tissues in the human head are
dispersive, and the EIS current density distribution depends on
the sensing stimulation frequency. Tissues such as bone and
CSF tend to divert currents entering the brain because their conductivities are very different compared to brain parenchyma.
In order to measure the EIS signal, different approaches have
been proposed. Because a sinusoidal sensing pulse at a single, individual frequency, however, might not fully characterize
small differences in the dielectric constant between different
tissues, alternative pulse generation schemes have been developed, mainly using multitone or frequency-sweep methods [9].
Indeed, our group is currently using a 0–50 kHz “white noise”
stimulation pulse for preliminary human studies of patients with
hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic stroke [7], [8], [10].
Because frequency difference imaging has the potential to
further improve sensitivity for the detection of deep intracranial
lesions, we propose an ideal probe current design based on
the concept of dual energy. In CT scanning, dual energy is
a relatively recent imaging technique that uses two different
X-ray energies (typically 140 and 80 kV) in a single CT

exposure. Bone or iodinated contrast material can be segmented
based on their spectral properties, and can be subtracted to
create an angiographic image [11].
In this paper, we describe—both in theory and with numerical
examples—the design of a dual-energy pulse for EIS, specifically based on the SGF [12]. The SGF is a uniformly distributed
noise modulated by a Gaussian envelope. Its behavior and propagation have been studied with an electromagnetic wave solver
or finite-difference time domain (FDTD) [12]. The Gabor transform has also been proposed as a probe signal in impedance
estimation for applications such as fault detection, due to the
fact that it has an optimal localization property in both the time
and frequency domains [13]. The SGF was chosen as the basis
for our dual-energy pulse stimulus because it reaps the benefits
of a very wide-frequency bandwidth, while retaining a nonnarrow pulsed envelope in time.
The proposed method consists of probing using two sequential SGF pulses with two different principal energies (see Fig. 1).
The Fourier transforms of each of the weighted SGF current
stimulation pulses are subtracted, and the Fourier transforms of
each of the weighted synchronous voltage responses are also
subtracted. The resulting Fourier-transformed subtracted input
and output values are then deconvolved to estimate the complex
impedance as a function of frequency.
Our results show that the depth of penetration of two different
SGF pulses, with two different principal energies, will vary in
the lossy media [14] of the human head. Although these two
different SGF pulses exhibit different tissue current distributions, they each maintain the broadband sensing pulse characteristics needed to stimulate all the frequencies of interest. In
this paper, we present images of pulse penetration model using
the SGF dual-energy subtraction scheme in a realistic human
head simulation. By applying the weighted SGF dual-energy
subtraction methodology, EIS sensitivity decreases relatively in
regions that would otherwise receive the highest current density
(e.g., skin, subcutaneous fat), but increases relatively in what
would otherwise be low-current density regions, such as the
brain parenchyma.

The SGF has a Gaussian envelope in the time domain; its
frequency representation (see Fig. 2, bottom) is very uniform.
One of the main advantages of the Gabor functions is their
time-frequency localization. This allows for the SGF excitation
signal in broad bandwidth and fast impedance measurement.
In this section, the SGF was studied in terms of localization
in the time domain, which can be measured by estimating the
time-frequency resolution to select the value for s, or pulse
width of the SGF [15]. A more uniform sampling in frequency
corresponds to a source excitation with lower concentration in
the sample frequency phase plane [17]:

In the model, two standard EEG electrodes with 10-mm diameter were modeled with perfect electrical conductors (PEC)
and were connected through PEC wires to a current source that
generated the two SGF pulses: the lower energy SGF was defined with s = 12.8 and the higher energy with s = 128 both

are the current densities of the low- and highenergy SGF, respectively, with peak amplitude normalized to
1 A/m2 . All components are shown at 500 kHz, and were computed using the chirp transform (e.g., the “czt” command in
MATLAB) of the electric fields and of the current densities
distribution. All electrical components were computed using
commercially available software (XFDTD v. 7, Remcom Inc.,
State College, PA) based on the FDTD algorithm [23], [24]. The
geometrical grid consisted of 1-mm3 uniform Yee cells [25].
The volume of the FDTD grid including the head model and
the EIS electrodes was 4,642,730 Yee cells. The total size of
the geometry, including the free space around the head model,
was 323 × 373 × 323 mm3 . Seven perfectly matching layers
were used for boundary conditions in all simulations [26]. The
timestep used to ensure FDTD Courant–Friedrich–Levy stability was 1.92 ps [23]. The computation times for both SGF stimuli
were 5 min for Ns = 105, respectively, using an eight-core Dell
Precision T7500 desktop computer with 48 gigabyte of RAM
on a C2070 graphics processing unit (Nvidia, Santa Clara, CA,
USA) with 6-GB graphics memory.

deep brain structures. Fig. 3 illustrates the distribution of the

the head using two different values of the energy or variance

the same when computed using all three pulsing schemes:
higher, lower, and dual-energy SGF. Conductivity had an unbounded upper limit (i.e., Inf in MATLAB) in correspondence
with the PEC material, where the electric field was null. Conductivity had null of σ located in the central spinal canal. The
skin conductivity was 0.4 S/m and white and gray matter σ was
0.1 S/m. Muscle had a conductivity of 2 S/m, cerebral spinal
fluid 13 S/m, and bone 0.06 S/m.

current density magnitude in (12) (center slice in dB relative
to 1 A/m2 ) as the weighting between the two SGF functions
varies between w = 0 and w = 1. For the case w = 1 (high
energy), the current density in the skin peaks, whereas for the
case w = 0 (low energy), the current density in the center of the
brain parenchyma peaks. The optimal weighting of w = 0.2 is
shown at the bottom of Fig. 5, where at this value the amplitude
of the current density on the skin is minimum compared to any
other values of w.

density for cases of 1) high energy (left), 2) low energy (right),

the cases of high or low energy alone. The current density in
low-energy SGF peaked at 2.4 104 A/m2 and high-energy SGF
peaked at 4.7 103 A/m2 located both in the occipital electrode.
All current density magnitudes were null around the head model.
Finally, the w = 0.2 case had a current density amplitude near
the electrode of 3.1 10−6 A/m2 or a reduction of approximately 3
million times compared to a single SGF stimulation pulse after
normalization. The CSF is clearly the tissue that has the highest
current density magnitude that peaks at 0.02 A/m2 .
V. DISCUSSION
Using both the head model [20] and FDTD simulations [23],
[24], we have shown that the proposed SGF dual-energy scheme
results in improved sensitivity of EIS measurements of deep
brain parenchymal impedance, compared to single stimulus
methods, as the sensitivity is determined by the weighted current
density [27].
This SGF dual-energy pulse scheme might provide a more
accurate alternative to current “absolute frequency difference”
and simple “linear frequency difference” EIS pulse stimulus
paradigms, which subtract two single sinusoidal sensing pulses
at two different individual frequencies to calculate impedance
[28]. Unlike these frequency difference imaging methods, SGF
dual-energy subtraction makes no assumptions regarding the
shape of the impedance distribution as a function of frequency,
i.e., in the dual-energy method, all subtractions are performed
in frequency without requiring any interpolation.
The proposed dual-energy scheme might also be utilized to
capture EIS measurements of events that occur in short time
intervals, such as cardiac or respiratory monitoring applications. Given the properties of broadband and compactness, the
SGF-based spectral impedance estimations are expected to be
optimal for nonstationary measurements [12]. The use of broadband excitation also has precedent, and may provide faster and
broader EIS estimation [9]. White noise EIS has been used to
measure the dielectric properties of the cell membrane, and has
achieved 1-ms measurements at 512 discrete frequencies, evenly
distributed from 976.56 Hz to 500 kHz [29].

Fig. 5. Current density magnitude (dB relative to 1 A/m2 ) changes as a function of posterior-to-anterior distance along the midline at the level of the body
of the corpus callosum in the head model simulation shown in Fig. 6 (top, with
color coded w-values). The current density magnitude is minimized at a w-value
of approximately 0.2 (bottom) in the model, which corresponds to a minimal
current density on the skin surface.

With regard to sampling strategies, sampling can be performed at the Nyquist rate. However, this method does not
optimize the number of samples, which can be obtained by following Landau’s approach of signal demodulation followed by
a lower sampling rate [30], where the demodulation is specifically implemented for the case of noise amplitude modulation [31]. An alternative sampling approach that does not require
demodulation can be achieved by periodically nonuniform sampling [32], [33] that results in an optimal average sampling
period equal to the SGF’s bandwidth.
Energy, and hence power deposition, of our proposed multifrequency method is larger than that of corresponding singleor dual-frequency methods, and is directly proportional to the
excitation bandwidth, given that the SGF frequency spectrum
is flat. Although heating of tissues is a theoretical possibility
at very large bandwidths (and of course should be avoided as
it may cause irreversible tissue damage), this is not a clinical
concern at the lower, 0–50 kHz frequencies (and which are currently implemented using a continuous “white noise” stimulus
in existing prototype EIS devices approved for clinical trials). As

(right), and weighted (dual energy) with w = 0.2 (center).

to whether very high SGF bandwidths (>1 MHz) might generate heating, the answer is clearly strongly dependent on the total
power deposition and the current density (inversely proportional
to electrode area) or the specific absorption rate of the multifrequency pulse [34]. Furthermore, the NRPB standard [35] limits
the current density as follows: (0–100 Hz) 100 mA/m2 , (100 –
101 Hz) 100/f mA/m2 , (101 –103 Hz) 10 mA/m2 , (103 –107 Hz)
f /100 mA/m2 , where f is the frequency in Hz. Therefore, Figs. 3

and 6 can be used to estimate the maximum |E|
adding +14 dB since the current density of the simulations
@50 kHz was normalized to five times smaller than the NRPB
limit (or adding +26 dB if following a recent and closely related
Food and Drug Administration safety guidelines draft [36]).
The modeling of each tissue was carefully performed based
on the very accurate morphometry of our head model and known
tissue dielectric constants. Most tissues in the human head have
complex but well-characterized anatomical features that were
accurately reflected in our model (for example, cortical bone
has a flat frequency response, but skull impedance varies due to
other tissues present, such as fatty marrow) [37]. Despite this,
there is clearly considerable intersubject variability in the shape
and composition of head structures, which represents a limitation of our current model. It may be possible, however, to control these patient-specific variables in future models by incorporating concurrent CT or MRI morphometric measurements.
Impedance imaging methods such as magnetic resonance electric properties tomography are also being developed [38] which
could further help refine future models.
EIS has been used on a research basis for a wide variety
of applications, such as measurement of osmotically induced
cellular volume changes in a perfused rat model [39], and monitoring of intracellular resistance, membrane capacitance, and
extracellular resistance [40]–[45].
Optimization of depth sensitivity in EIS measurement using
the dual-energy SGF excitation pulses also has the potential
to help develop proposed future point-of-care clinical applications, such as ICH and stroke detection [7], [8], [10], [46], [47]
as well as noninvasive assessment of brain tumors [48], ar-

teriovenous malformations, and radiation injury [49], cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia [50], perinatal hypoxia [51] and asphyxia [52], [53], thyroid nodules classification [54], and functional electrical stimulation efficacy [55], epilepsy [56], [57],
and general brain function [58].
VI. CONCLUSION
We have shown that the use of an SGF dual-energy pulse generation paradigm can improve the sensitivity of EIS measurements of deep parenchymal tissues, compared to single stimulus
methods. Indeed, simulations with FDTD have shown that the
proposed SGF dual-energy excitation scheme is capable of reducing the amplitude of weighted current densities on the skin
surface by approximately 3 million times compared to a single
SGF stimulation pulse, while maintaining an acceptable tissue
conductivity distribution in the brain parenchyma that could
enhance the detection assessment of deep brain impedance values. This increased sensitivity for the detection of small, deep
impedance changes might be of value in potential future EIS applications, such as the portable, point-of-care detection of deep
brain hemorrhage or infarction [7], [8], [10].
