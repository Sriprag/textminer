A Gaussian Model-Based Probabilistic Approach
for Pulse Transit Time Estimation
Dae-Geun Jang, Seung-Hun Park, and Minsoo Hahn

Abstract—In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic approach to pulse transit time (PTT) estimation using a Gaussian
distribution model. It is motivated basically by the hypothesis that
PTTs normalized by RR intervals follow the Gaussian distribution.
To verify the hypothesis, we demonstrate the effects of arterial
compliance on the normalized PTTs using the Moens–Korteweg
equation. Furthermore, we observe a Gaussian distribution of the
normalized PTTs on real data. In order to estimate the PTT using the hypothesis, we first assumed that R-waves in the electrocardiogram (ECG) can be correctly identified. The R-waves limit
searching ranges to detect pulse peaks in the photoplethysmogram
(PPG) and to synchronize the results with cardiac beats—i.e., the
peaks of the PPG are extracted within the corresponding RR interval of the ECG as pulse peak candidates. Their probabilities of
being the actual pulse peak are then calculated using a Gaussian
probability function. The parameters of the Gaussian function are
automatically updated when a new pulse peak is identified. This
update makes the probability function adaptive to variations of
cardiac cycles. Finally, the pulse peak is identified as the candidate
with the highest probability. The proposed approach is tested on
a database where ECG and PPG waveforms are collected simultaneously during the submaximal bicycle ergometer exercise test.
The results are promising, suggesting that the method provides a
simple but more accurate PTT estimation in real applications.

I. INTRODUCTION
ULSE transit time (PTT) is the time needed for a pulse wave
to travel between two arterial sites. The ongoing research
defines the PTT as various time intervals depending on the
equipment used and applications: 1) the time interval between
the R-wave of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the following
pulse peak of the photoplethysmogram (PPG) [1], [2]; 2) the
time interval between the R-wave of the ECG and the pulse
onset of the PPG [3]; 3) the time interval between the R-wave of
the ECG and the partial amplitude (e.g., 25% and 50%) on the
upslope of the PPG [4]; 4) the time interval between the R-wave
of the ECG and either the maximum peak of the first or second

derivative of the PPG [5]; and 5) the time interval between pulse
waveforms measured from one or two distinct locations [6], [7].
The PTT is mainly used not only for estimating both systolic
and diastolic blood pressures continuously [1], [8], but also for
calculating the pulse wave velocity (PWV), which is a measure
of arterial stiffness [9], [10]. The PTT is also used as an indirect
diagnostic marker for detecting sleep disordered breathing [11],
[12] and as an indicator of respiratory effort [13], [14]. In this
study, we used the PTT measured as the time interval from the
R-wave of the ECG to the following pulse peak of the PPG,
within the same cardiac cycle (see Fig. 1) [1], [2].
In spite of the wide applicability of the PTT, there is a lack
of research on its estimation. Traditionally, the PTT has been
estimated directly on the pulse waveforms by picking the maximum peak in a range of consecutive R-waves [1], [5]. However,
this approach can yield unreliable results in noisy and corrupted
PPG signals [15]. In order to cope with this problem, Solà
et al. introduced a parametric approach [5]. It first models pulse
waveforms through specific models (Morlet wavelet and hyperbolic tangent function) and then searches for an estimator of the
PTT that shows the minimum distance between the actual and
the modeled pulse waveforms. The PTT is finally estimated by
passing through specified transformation functions. Hahn et al.
also estimated aortic-to-peripheral PTT using two blood pressure waveforms measured at different diametric peripheral locations [6]. A computational relationship between the peripheral
blood pressures was evaluated using the modified T-tube model,
and the PTT was estimated from the parameters identified for
the cardiovascular system model. Harada et al. provide modelbased PWV estimation methods using one-point blood pressure
[16]. One method employs wave intensity analysis, and another
one uses stiffness parameter of the artery and the water-hammer
equation to derive PWV. These approaches are relatively robust

to PTT estimation in noisy PPG signals because they use the
parametric model and thus represents the global characteristics
of the PTT considerably well. Furthermore, they do not require
any a priori knowledge of the measurement locations and of the
physiologic condition of the cardiovascular system. However,
since these approaches cannot accurately track each variation
of the PTT and is restricted to arterial blood pressure and flow
waveforms [3], it is not useful for analyzing local characteristics
of the PTT, such as PTT variability.
In addition, the PTT can also be identified using the various
pulse peak estimation methods: the knowledge-based rules [17],
the adaptive threshold method [18], and the template matching
method [19]. The knowledge-based rules utilize the fact that
the pulse shape (e.g., pulse duration) is slowly time-varying
information and thus can be used for estimating pulse peaks
[17]. In the adaptive threshold method, it was designed to detect
pulse peaks using a directional threshold with a slope parameter
[18]. Because the method utilizes the directional threshold, it can
estimate pulse peaks correctly, even in the situation where the
pulse shape varies dynamically. The template matching method
uses a similarity between the reference template and the input
PPG waveforms [19]. Because the method uses the reference
template extracted from the individuals, it can provide a subject
adaptive pulse peak estimation. Although these methods provide
high accuracy on detecting pulse peaks from PPG signals, there
is limitation on estimating PTTs because they do not consider
the R-wave information.
In order to address the shortcomings while maintaining the
benefits, we propose a new probabilistic approach using the
normalized PTTs (nPTTs), which are defined as PTT/RR in
Fig. 1. It utilizes the fact that the nPTTs are slowly time-varying
signals and they generally follow the Gaussian distribution.
In this study, we basically assumed that R-waves in ECG signals were already correctly identified. This assumption makes
our study easy to follow and to understand because it helps to exclude unnecessary concerns about algorithmic performance for
R-wave detection. The R-waves can be accurately identified by
using various ECG delineating algorithms, such as the empirical
mode decomposition [20], the wavelets [21], the morphological
filtering [22], and knowledge-based methods [23].

II. PULSE PROPAGATION MODEL
A simple pulse propagation model with inviscid fluid in an
elastic tube can be described by the Moens–Korteweg equation
[24], [25]. The equation has been established with the following
assumptions: the tube is thin-walled, it is filled with an incompressible fluid, and the fluid is homogeneous and isotropic
and has no viscosity [25]. Although these assumptions may not
be valid in vivo, they describe well the global aspects of the
pulse propagation [25]. In particular, since it clearly represents
the relationship between the pulse propagation speed and the
arterial compliance, the Moens–Korteweg equation is appropriate to describe the relationship between the PTT, which is
inversely proportional to the pulse propagation speed, and the
arterial compliance [3], [24], [25].

129

The Moens–Korteweg equation is defined as follows [24]:

Eh
(1)
s=
ρd0
where E, h, d0 , and ρ are the Young’s modulus for the tube wall,
the vessel wall thickness, the vessel diameter (2r), and the constant blood density, respectively. Higher values of E represent
lower elasticity of the tube wall [24]. The resulting s indicates
the pulse propagation speed or PWV. Equation (1) states that
the PWV is proportional to the square root of the incremental
elastic modulus (E) of the vessel wall given a constant ratio of
wall thickness to vessel diameter and blood density under the
assumptions that the artery wall is isotropic and experiences
isovolumetric change with the pulse pressure [26]. Since the
PTT is inversely proportional to the PWV [3], we can see that
the elastic property of the vessel walls plays an important role
in PTT estimation.
III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
A. Subjects
In order to observe the distribution of the real nPTTs and to
evaluate the proposed approach, we collected ECG and PPG
waveforms simultaneously from 74 subjects (50 male, 24 female; age range 18–60; average age 30.0 ± 13.2 years; total
pulses 224 765; test time 30 min; PTT 29.69 ± 4.10 ms; nPTT
0.5078 ± 0.0707 n.u.) during a submaximal cycle ergometer
exercise stress test. All subjects abstained from any exhaustive
exercise and meals for 3 h prior to the experiment. The ECG and
PPG data were obtained in the same experiment environment,
but they were independently collected from different subjects.
Some of the collected data were used for training while the
others, for performance evaluation. Namely, the ECG and PPG
data from 52 subjects (35 male, 17 female; age range 18–60;
average age 28.8 ± 13.2 years; total pulses 159 205; test time
30 min) were used for training, i.e., to model and confirm the
Gaussian distribution of nPTTs in real environments. Furthermore, the data from the remaining 22 subjects (15 male, 7 female; age range 18–57; average age 32.9 ± 13.0 years; total
pulses 65 560; test time 30 min) were used to assess the performance of the proposed PTT estimation method.
B. Experimental Protocol
An electrically braked cycle ergometer (HIMS Medical, TheHIMS Inc., Korea) with a multistage protocol in Fig. 2 was
used for the experiment. The protocol has six consecutive 5min sessions (rest, 4 workout, and recovery sessions) for each
subject’s sex. It was basically designed to raise the maximum heart rate to between 110 beats/min and 85% of the
age-predicted maximum heart rate (modified YMCA cycle ergometer test). In the experiment, subjects were requested to
remain in sitting posture during rest and recovery sessions
while maintaining a pedaling speed of 60 ± 5 r/min during consecutive four workout sessions. They also required
not to speak during the test and to try fixing their upper
body on the ergometer to reduce effects of motion artifacts.

C. Data Acquisition and Annotation

provide reliable estimates for small to medium sized samples
(e.g., n < 300), but not for large samples [29], [30].

To obtain ECG and PPG signals simultaneously, we used
an integrated ECG and PPG acquisition system (P400 series,
PhysioLab Inc., Korea) at 2 kHz sampling rate per channel with
12-bit resolution. The PPG acquisition module adopts a reflection mode in which a photodetector senses reflected light from
the pulsatile arterial blood flow and from other static signals
such as tissue signals [27]. Furthermore, in order to reduce the
distortion in pulse waveforms, no autogain control is employed
in the PPG acquisition module. The system itself is designed to
eliminate noises in the signals with passbands of 0.3–35 Hz for
the ECG and of 0.1–10 Hz for the PPG. Furthermore, it basically
has an analog notch filter to eliminate 60-Hz power line interferences. The ECG signals were obtained continuously with an
established 3-lead ECG configuration (Einthoven’s triangle). In
particular, lead I ECG waveforms were used for this study. The
PPG signals were obtained from the right index finger of the
subject.
Characteristic points including R-waves and pulse peaks were
manually annotated by a fully experienced biomedical engineer
(D.-G. Jang). R-waves were annotated with the criterion of the
first upward deflection after the small upward wave (P-wave) in
the ECG signals [28] and pulse peaks were annotated with the
criterion of the first maximum peak of each cardiac cycle in the
PPG signals [15], [16].
IV. HYPOTHESIS TESTING
The basic premise of the proposed approach is that the nPTTs
generally follow a Gaussian distribution. We will show that not
only by the simulation study but also by observing the distribution of the nPTTs on real data. In this study, a combination
of skewness and kurtosis was used to test the normality of the
distribution because the conventional normality tests including
the Shapiro–Wilk test and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test may

A. Simulation Study
In order to demonstrate the effects of the arterial compliance
on PTTs, the Moens–Korteweg equation was used because it
describes well the global aspects of the pulse propagation [24].
Because the arterial compliance is the reciprocal of the Young’s
modulus [31] and the PTT is inversely proportional to the PWV
[3], the arterial compliance is proportional to the square of the
PTT, as shown in


√

PTT ∝ =
∝
∝ c
(2)

h
where c stands for the arterial compliance.
For demonstration, we first generated 10 million values of arterial compliance with a mean of 1.43 ml/mmHg and a standard
deviation of 0.68 ml/mmHg based on the normality of arterial
compliances [32]. To avoid negative values, we added an offset
value of 3.57, which made a sample mean of 5, to the generated values. The PTTs were then considered as square roots
of the generated arterial compliance values based on (2). The
histograms of the arterial compliance and the PTT with their
skewness and kurtosis are shown in Fig. 3.
In Fig. 3, arterial compliance values are normally distributed
(skewness of 0.0003 and kurtosis of –0.0059) while the resulting
PTTs have a slightly left-skewed distribution (negative skewness
of −0.2125) and a slightly peaked distribution (positive kurtosis
of 0.1192). This result supports the hypothesis for the Gaussian
distribution of PTTs since the skewness and the kurtosis are
greatly close to zero, respectively [29], [30]. Furthermore, it
partially supports the hypothesis for the Gaussian distribution
of nPTTs because the nPTTs and the PTTs are highly associated
with each other.

Histogram of nPTTs on real data.

The Gaussian distribution of nPTTs can also be verified by
the central limit theorem. Basically, the central limit theorem
states that the normalized sum of a large number of mutually
independent variables tends to become the Gaussian probability
distribution function [33]. In our hypothesis, we can consider
that nPTT values are obtained many times from a large number
of observations and each observation is generated randomly but
with finite variances. Therefore, we can conclude that if arithmetic means of the observed nPTTs are repeatedly calculated,
the computed values follow the bell-shaped Gaussian distribution [34].
B. Distribution of nPTTs With Real Data
A histogram analysis of the nPTTs on the collected data was
carried out to confirm the hypothesis in actual environments. The
resulting histogram and its skewness and kurtosis are shown in
Fig. 4. The results show that the nPTTs also have a slightly
left-skewed Gaussian distribution (a mean of 0.5078 and a standard deviation of 0.0707) and support the simulation results
[see Fig. 3(b)]. The small skewness of –0.0894 and the kurtosis of 0.1321 further validate the hypothesis of the Gaussian
distribution of the nPTTs [29], [30].
In addition, a histogram analysis of PTTs on the collected
data was also conducted to provide justification for the use
of the nPTT instead of the PTT. The result shows that the
PTTs have a relatively right-skewed (skewness of 0.7907) and
more peaked (kurtosis of 1.3873) distribution than those of the
nPTTs. Therefore, we can conclude that the nPTT is more appropriate to the Gaussian model-based PTT estimation than the
PTT because the nPTT has the skewness and the kurtosis values,
which are more close to zero than those of the PTTs.
V. PTT ESTIMATION AND RESULTS
A. Proposed PTT Estimation
The proposed PTT estimation comes from the fact that ECGs
and PPGs are slowly time varying and their derivatives, such

as nPTTs, generally follow the Gaussian distribution. The basic
idea of the PTT estimation is graphically depicted in Fig. 5.
The proposed approach first identifies R-waves in the ECG
signal. The identified R-waves set the ranges for pulse peak
detection. At each range, all peaks in the PPG signal become
primary candidates of the pulse peak. In addition, zero crossing points of the second derivative of the PPG signal are also
considered as secondary candidates because pulse peaks can
occasionally be defined as points of inflection. In such cases,
peaks are not clearly observable. The probabilities of being an
actual pulse peak are calculated using a simple Gaussian probability function, as shown in Fig. 5. The probability function, p,
with the expected value of μ and the standard deviation of σ, is
defined as follows:
p(x) =

1 x −μ 2
1
√ e− 2 ( σ ) .
σ 2π

(3)

p(x) is then normalized to have values between 0 and 1. The
parameters (μ and σ) are initially set to the values (0.5078
and 0.0707, respectively) calculated from the training database.
These parameters are calculated again after 60 PTTs (about
1 min) to provide a subject-adaptive Gaussian model, and then
automatically updated when a new pulse peak is identified to reduce inter- and intrasubject PTT variations. This update makes
the probability function adaptive to cardiac cycle variations.
Finally, the pulse peak is estimated by picking one of the primary candidates having the maximum probability at each cardiac cycle. If the probability of the estimated one is lower than
the preset threshold, the secondary candidate having the highest
probability larger than the preset threshold becomes the pulse
peak.
B. Performance Evaluation
As previously mentioned, we basically assumed that R-waves
in ECG signals are already correctly identified. This assumption
makes the evaluation more clearly by disregarding effects of the
algorithmic performance for R-wave detection. The annotated
R-wave information was used not only to set the ranges for
pulse peak detection, but also to normalize the candidates with
respect to the RR interval. For the algorithm implementation,

the initial mean and the standard deviation of the Gaussian
function are set to 0.5078 and 0.0707, respectively, based on
the histogram analysis results in Fig. 4. Furthermore, the preset
threshold was set to 0.4, which is a probability value accounting
for approximately 87% (±1.5σ) of the data.
We investigated how closely the proposed approach detects
true positions of pulse peaks and how accurately it estimates
PTTs compared to the conventional maximum peak picking
method [1], [5], the knowledge-based rules [17], the adaptive threshold method [18], and the template matching method
[19] using three quantitative measures: the normalized error
rate (ERnorm ) [15], the mean absolute difference (MAD) of
pulse peaks, and the MAD of PTTs. Each measure is defined as
follows:

where Ireal and Idetected are pulse peaks (or PTTs) manually annotated in the data and automatically detected by the algorithms,
respectively. Furthermore, two statistical measures [sensitivity
and positive predictive value (PPV)] were also employed to assess the usefulness of the proposed method in practice [35]. In
this study, we assumed that samples are correctly detected when
a detection error is less than 2 ms [11].
Performances of the PTT estimation methods were evaluated
on both the training and testing data to identify whether the
parameters of the Gaussian distribution model fit well to both the
training and the testing data without overfitting. The evaluation
results on each data are described in Tables I and II, respectively.
The results indicate that the methods utilizing R-wave information (i.e., the maximum peak picking method and the proposed method) outperform the others in all aspects. Furthermore,
it can be noticed that the proposed method shows higher performance than the maximum peak picking method, particularly in
the normalized error rate and the MAD.
In addition, Fig. 6 demonstrates a case in which a PTT is
correctly identified using the proposed Gaussian probabilistic
model based method, whereas the conventional maximum peak

picking method in false results. The PPG signal is contaminated
by the cardiac beat synchronized impulsive noise (e.g., noises
caused by pedaling with a speed of 60 r/min). This noise makes
the conventional maximum peak picking method fail to identify
actual pulse peaks. In the circle of Fig. 6, we can demonstrate
that the maximum peak picking method fails to identify actual
pulse peaks, while the proposed method detects actual pulse
peaks correctly. Therefore, we can conclude that the proposed
method outperforms the conventional maximum peak picking
method in identifying PTTs from noisy PPG signals.
VI. DISCUSSION
In order to show how well the proposed approach estimates
PTT accurately, the ERnorm and the MAD were used. Since
these measures quantize the error between manually annotated
and automatically detected PTTs, the smaller the values of the
ERnorm and the MAD, the better is the performance [15]. The
results show that the measures of the proposed method are lower
than those of the conventional maximum peak picking and pulse
peak estimation methods. We can therefore insist that the proposed Gaussian model based approach estimates PTTs more
accurately than the conventional ones do.
Two statistical measures were also used for assessing the efficacy of the proposed approach in practice. The sensitivity was
used for summarizing how well the proposed approach identifies

JANG et al.: GAUSSIAN MODEL-BASED PROBABILISTIC APPROACH FOR PULSE TRANSIT TIME ESTIMATION

actual PTTs. It was well known that a higher sensitivity is desirable to provide better prediction accuracy [36]. As another
measure, the PPV is also used to assess the repeatability, the
precision, and the reproducibility of the methods [35]. A higher
PPV is desirable to provide better performance. Since the results show very high sensitivity and PPV, we can notice that the
proposed approach estimates PTT accurately in practice.
The results demonstrate that the methods utilizing R-wave
information (i.e., the maximum peak picking and proposed
Gaussian probabilistic methods) are desirable to estimate PTTs
compared to the methods estimating pulse peaks directly from
the PPG signals (i.e., the knowledge-based rules, the adaptive
threshold method, and the template matching method). This is
due to the fact that R-wave information provides a proper searching range for pulse peak estimation and thus lead to recognize
pulse peaks more accurately. Furthermore, the low sensitivity
and PPV of the conventional pulse peak estimation methods can
be explained from the fact that the PTT estimation requires the
identification of true positions of pulse peaks, while the existing
methods were basically designed to estimate peak-to-peak intervals accurately, not to recognize true peak positions. In addition,
the very low flaw size of 2 ms for the performance evaluation
may lead to the low sensitivity and PPV results.
The performance evaluation results also show that the performance measures are remarkably improved by the proposed
method compared to the conventional ones (see Tables I and II),
particularly in terms of the normalized error rate and the MAD.
They also confirm that the proposed method recognizes well the
true positions of pulse peaks and thus can estimate PTTs more
accurately than the conventional maximum peak picking and
pulse peak estimation methods do.
In addition to the algorithmic performance, the proposed
method provides a subject adaptation scheme to estimate PTTs.
That is, the proposed method is robust to both inter- and intrasubject cardiac variations by updating the Gaussian probabilistic
model using the parameters estimated from the individuals. Furthermore, the proposed method also has benefit of updating the
model because the Gaussian probabilistic function only requires
the mean and the standard deviation, which are relatively easy to
derive from the data. Therefore, we can insist that the proposed
method is better than the others to estimate PTTs in terms of
reliability, usability, and efficiency.
VII. CONCLUSION
We proposed a simple and robust probabilistic approach to
PTT estimation using the Gaussian distribution function. In
order to represent distributional characteristics of PTTs more
clearly, we first defined the nPTT, which is defined as a PTT
divided by the corresponding RR interval. The proposed approach utilized the facts that the nPTTs are slowly time varying
and they follow the Gaussian distribution. These facts were first
verified by simulating a pulse propagation model and observing
the distribution of nPTTs on real data. Then, we evaluated the
proposed approach on the exercise stress test data to verify its
usefulness in various physiological conditions. The results are
promising, suggesting that the proposed approach can provide

133

a simple but much more accurate PTT estimation. In addition,
since the proposed method is a distribution model based one, it
can be easily utilized in PTT estimation with any pair of arterial
pulse waveforms.
The primary limitation of this study is to assume that the
cardiac signals, such as ECG and PPG, are slowly time-varying
signals. This assumption may not be valid in special clinical
conditions such as cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., the cardiac intervals are irregular during atrial fibrillation). Therefore, it is
required to evaluate the performance of the proposed method
in the clinical situations where cardiac information is highly
irregular. This may improve practicality and performance of
the proposed method in real clinical applications, such as sleep
disorder evaluation.
