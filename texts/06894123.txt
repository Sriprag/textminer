A Glycolysis-Based In Silico Model
for the Solid Tumor Growth

and Michalis E. Zervakis, Member, IEEE

Abstract—Cancer–tumor growth is a complex process depending on several biological factors, such as the chemical microenvironment of the tumor, the cellular metabolic profile, and its proliferation rate. Several mathematical models have been developed
for identifying the interactions between tumor cells and tissue microenvironment, since they play an important role in tumor formation and progression. Toward this direction we propose a new
continuum model of avascular glioma-tumor growth, which incorporates a new factor, namely, the glycolytic potential of cancer cells,
to express the interactions of three different tumor-cell populations
(proliferative, hypoxic, and necrotic) with their tissue microenvironment. The glycolytic potential engages three vital nutrients, i.e.,
oxygen, glucose, and lactate, which provide cells with the necessary
energy for their survival and proliferation. Extensive simulations
are performed for different evolution times and various proliferation rates, in order to investigate how the tumor growth is affected.
According to medical experts, the experimental observations indicate that the model predicts quite satisfactorily the overall tumor
growth as well as the expansion of each region separately. Following
extensive evaluation, the proposed model may provide an essential
tool for patient-specific tumor simulation and reliable prediction
of glioma spatiotemporal expansion.

I. INTRODUCTION
ANCER, one of the most lethal pathologies, is characterized by tumor cells’ aggressive proliferation and invasive
behavior. Glioma tumors are the most common types of brain
cancer, well known for their poor outcome leading to high mortality rates. At tumor level, three tumor zones are recognized,
namely, the proliferative, the hypoxic, and the necrotic regions
[1]. At the proliferative zone, which forms the outer zone of
tumor, the cells interact with their surrounding environment to
reach necessary nutrients, such as oxygen and glucose, in order
to satisfy their energy needs. When oxygen level falls below a
critical threshold, cells suffer from hypoxia and a second zone is

created, referred to as the hypoxic zone. Similarly, the glucose
levels are continuously depleted, leading to local hypoglycemia.
Hypoxia and hypoglycemia force cells to death, resulting to the
formation of the necrotic core, widely known as the necrotic
zone. Among the biological mechanisms that a solid tumor exploits in order to gain the necessary energy is the glycolysis
process [2]. Glycolysis (break down of blood glucose) is an
anaerobic cellular metabolic pathway, different than the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) process that usually takes
place in the mitochondrial of cells in the presence of adequate
amount of oxygen. Glycolysis provides only two molecules of
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (energy molecules), as opposed
to the 36 molecules in OXPHOS. In 1956, Otto Warburg noticed
that even if enough oxygen is provided to the tumor there are
many cancer cells that “prefer” the glycolysis pathway for their
energy needs rather than OXPHOS process, resulting to high
production of lactate along with H+ ions [3]. This glycolytic
behavior of the tumor cells is known as the Warburg effect and
considers glycolysis as a metabolic pathway of great influence
on tumor growth [4]. A related process known as Pasteur effect
[5] associates high oxygen concentration with a reduction of
glycolytic activity.
Since the Warburg effect observation, a lot of research has
been addressed to explain the growth mechanisms of a solid
tumor. In silico cancer modeling is a research field that shows
promise to assist in this direction for accurately predicting the
tumor progressive behavior and, most importantly, for revealing
its future metastatic trends. Present modeling techniques follow
a continuum framework that explores volume expansion of tumors of clinically significant size based on reaction–diffusion
equations, or a discrete cell-based description that simulates the
individual cell behavior [1], [6]–[9]. Apart from the discrete
and continuum approaches, hybrid models have been developed
to combine the two different variable descriptions in order to
overcome certain limitations in implementation [10].
Several cancer modeling efforts investigate tumor growth hypotheses based on the metabolic profile of cancer cells that relate
to chemical ingredients, such as oxygen and glucose. The intratumoral availability of oxygen is explored most often, since
its inadequacy leads to hypoxia, a condition characterized by
changes in cell metabolic profile, proliferation, and invasion
rate [8], [10], [11]. Some approaches apart from oxygen involve glucose as a second vital nutrient, in order to investigate
spatiotemporal tumor evolution, along with the formation of
nonproliferating and necrotic cell population regions [12]–[14].
In the approach of [15], a hybrid model for glioma growth and
malignant cell invasion is presented. The model is initialized

by a clinically significant tumor size. Following this, a discrete
stochastic model is used to track movement and location of
each migratory cell, phenotype differentiation, proliferation, and
apoptosis. Additionally, a continuum model based on diffusion
equations is developed for nutrient transport and absorption.
Recent studies have further revealed the significance of glycolysis on classifying and treating solid tumors [16], [17]. Several modeling efforts explicitly incorporate the glycolysis effect,
through the change in the hypoxic metabolism and/or the implementation of the entire glycolytic reaction, along with the
related products, such as lactate and H+ ions [18], [19]. Avascular tumor growth is presented in [20], incorporating cellular proliferation, adhesion, and viability, along with nutrients,
wastes, growth promoters, and inhibitors. Furthermore, the hybrid and the discrete cancer evolution models of [21] and [22],
respectively, investigate the emergence of the glycolytic phenotype, involving oxygen, glucose, and H+ concentrations. The
glycolytic phenotype is also explored in the research efforts
[23]–[25] supporting the hypothesis that the change in pH of
tumor microenvironment may provide an important mechanism
for cancer invasion. Acidic pH is identified as a crucial factor
in cancer cell survival, proliferation, and invasion [26], since
according to the model in [27], the variation of intratumoral pH
leads to the formation of different tumor regions, such as proliferative, quiescent, and necrotic. The model of [28] is based
on the consideration that lactate can be consumed as a carbon
source under low concentration of glucose and high concentration of oxygen. Thus, oxygenated tumor cells can consume
extracellular lactate, preserving glucose for use by the hypoxic
cells. The approach of [29] adopts this assumption and lactate
serves as nutrient associated to the oxidative phenotype of tumor
cells.
In this paper, we introduce a new approach, which attempts
to demonstrate how the glycolytic activity within tumor cells affects the growth of each cancerous zone (proliferative, hypoxic,
and necrotic). Toward this direction, we propose a novel continuum multicompartmental mathematical model of avascular
glioma growth. A continuum glioma model can be initialized
based either on the actual tumor geometry derived from medical
images, or on a virtual spherical tumor that approximates the real
case in terms of its shape and imaging detectable size [13]–[15].
Based on this rationale, the proposed model is spherical including separate tumor regions consisting of distinct cell populations
of three different cellular phenotypes, namely, proliferative, hypoxic, and necrotic. Moreover, the model induces the effects
of three vital nutrients, i.e., oxygen, glucose, and lactate concentration on tumor cell proliferation and survival. While most
continuum studies consider cancer-cell diffusion, our approach
models tumor evolution guided by glycolysis, through a new
formulation based on the glycolytic potential of tumor cells in
the three regions of interest. It effectively induces the influence
of this glycolytic potential on the growth of the each zone separately but also on the overall tumor expansion. The expression
of glycolytic potential incorporates a Michaelis–Menten factor.
However, unlike other approaches that use Michaelis–Menten
kinetics for nutrients’ concentration change, we exploit this factor directly for tumor expansion in each zone, taking advantage

1107

of the differences in individual zones. Our model builds on the
validated assumption that glycolysis is directly associated to the
concentration of oxygen, glucose, and lactate and incorporates
this consideration via the glycolytic potential to influence tumor
growth. Thus, the rate of population change of tumor cells in
different zones depends as usually on the total proliferation rate
but also reduces exponentially with the glycolytic potential.
Moreover, the novelty of our approach is based on the fact
that it adopts not only the established Warburg and Pasteur effects but also the recent observation by Sonveaux et al, which
supports the claim that well oxygenated cancer cells borrow
their glucose to the hypoxic cells [28]. The latter effect is exploited in the hypoxic zone, where the production of energy
that controls tumor growth is solely based on anaerobic glycolysis. Overall, we explore the mechanisms of growth in the three
zones on the basis of glycolysis-related effects. Thus, we study
the glycolytic behavior of each tumor region based on different
forms of production, diffusion and consumption of nutrients,
and incorporate interactions between the three zones through
the transition of the tumor cells from one region to another. The
proposed model can examine the impact of glycolysis on a developed (larger than 1 cm radius) tumor, already consisting of
distinct zones. This model is in close agreement with the clinical
practice, where a tumor is first visualized in MRI modalities as
to identify clearly distinguishable regions, namely, solid mass,
hypoxic border, necrosis, and edema. Overall, our approach attempts to simulate the evolution of distinct regions in cancer
progression as observed in image modalities while introducing
the verified influence of glycolysis in the corresponding zones.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe
in detail the differential equations that govern the different cell
and chemical compartments of the proposed model along with
the involved parameters. Section III presents experimental results of tumor growth under different proliferation rates and
for various evolution times. Moreover, as demonstrated in the
same section, model validation is performed through comparisons with experimental results derived from related literature
and clinical data of real tumors. Furthermore, the incorporated
effects, such as Sonveaux, Pasteur, and Warburg, are evaluated through different modeling scenarios, also presented in
Section III. The results of our approach are discussed and compared in Section IV. Finally, significant conclusions are drawn in
Section V regarding its potential exploitation for clinical assessment toward patient-specific cancer prediction. A preliminary
version of this study has been reported in [30].
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Model Description
An in silico tumor growth model must be based on sound biological knowledge and described by valid mathematical rules.
Additionally, it builds on the consideration of specific basic assumptions, with a satisfactory number of input variables, while
its accuracy should be validated by means of experimental data.
The biological assumptions of our model are derived from Fig. 1.
In proliferation zone, Fig. 1 demonstrates that the majority
of tumor cells have adequate energy resources, i.e., oxygen and

glucose, owing to their proximity to the surrounding capillary
system. Due to the rich amount of oxygen in their microenvironment, these cells initially start consuming oxygen following the
respiration process just like healthy cells, i.e., via the OXPHOS
pathway. For the same reason of rich oxygen availability, the glycolytic activity is slowed down (Pasteur effect) [5] and a glucose
reserve is created. After some time though, oxygen is depleting and the hypoxic zone starts its formation. The cells within
this zone are forced to initiate intense glycolytic rates (Warburg
effect) and produce high amounts of lactate. This is the stage
where the glucose reserve created by the well oxygenated cells is
borrowed to the hypoxic cells (Sonveaux et al. effect) [28]. But
this fact leaves the proliferating cells with low glucose reserve.
At this point, they start consuming lactate, which escapes to the
extracellular environment through the hypoxic-cell membrane.
On the other hand, the excess of lactate generates an acidic environment (low pH), which kills the healthy cells nearby, thus
cancer cells gain extra space in order to proliferate. At the end,
as nutrients’ reserves are eliminated, the tumor cells start dying,
and the formation of the necrotic zone appears in Fig. 1. With
the proposed approach, we attempt to illustrate that these three
concepts play the role of a cellular switch, which guides a cell
to select the necessary energy resources depending on the zone
it belongs to, in order to survive and assist the zones’ formation
and development.
The proposed spherical model incorporates the populations
of three different glioma-tumor regions consisting of proliferative, hypoxic, and necrotic cells; the necrotic region forms
the core of the tumor, followed by the hypoxic ring, while the
proliferative zone is located on the outward side of the tumor,
as shown in Fig. 2.
The tumor interacts with the tissue microenvironment in terms
of nutrients consumption and production, in order to evolve in an

isotropic and homogeneous medium. Since our model engages
the glycolytic potential of cancer cells in each tumor zone, it
is important to accurately define this term. Glycolytic potential
describes the ability of the cancer cells to reach and consume
significant nutrients that are diffused to their close environment,
either by the vasculature system that surrounds the tumor (such
as oxygen and glucose) or by the cells themselves as products
of intracellular biological processes (lactate). Each of the tumor
regions is governed by specific equations, which express the
corresponding cell population changes, as well as the concentration changes of the related nutrients. Nutrients concentration
changes inside the tumor but also in tumor surroundings are
subjected to diffusion principles so that their local concentrations are estimated based on diffusion equations [10], [12], [31].
These equations apart from the nutrients diffusion in the different tumor zones include their consumption by the tumor cells.
All equations are based on certain assumptions effective on the
different tumor zones, as described in the following sections.
1) Proliferative Region Assumptions: Within the proliferative zone, the tumor cells are mainly consuming oxygen and
lactate, preserving glucose for the hypoxic cells [28]. Thus, the
proliferative region is characterized by nutrient diffusion and
consumption for oxygen and lactate but only nutrient diffusion
for glucose. Oxygen and glucose are diffused via the extracellular material located in the tumor surroundings, while lactate
is produced by cellular glycolysis by hypoxic cells inside the
tumor and diffused to the extra-tumoral area.
The change in oxygen concentration in the proliferative zone
is subjected to the following diffusion equation, where its consumption by the proliferative cells has been included via a
Michaelis–Menten factor [4]:

In this notation, O(r,t) stands for the oxygen concentration

coefficients for oxygen, KO represents the initial maximum
oxygen concentration outside the tumor (reference value), VO
is the oxygen maximum consumption rate by the proliferative
cancer cells, and Pd (r, t) stands for the proliferative cells density, which is calculated from their population and the current
proliferative volume.
Similarly, the change in lactate concentration in the proliferative zone is subjected to the diffusion equation describing
a form of Michaelis–Menten consumption by the proliferative
cells [4]

where La(r,t) corresponds to the lactate concentration at proliferative tumor point r, at time t, DLa is the diffusion coefficients for
lactate, KLa represents the initial value for lactate concentration
inside the tumor, and VLa is the lactate maximum consumption
rate by the proliferative cancer cells.
Moreover, the change in glucose concentration Gl(r,t) in a
proliferative-zone point is governed only by diffusion with rate
DGl , since the proliferative cells are considered to consume no
glucose at all, as
∂Gl(r, t)
= DGl ∇2 Gl(r, t).
(3)
∂t
The cell population in the proliferative region P(t) increases
due to the cell proliferation, but also decreases as proliferative
cells become hypoxic due to their difficulty to reach oxygen
supplies. The following equation describes the proliferative cell
population change with respect to the proliferation factor fP (t)
and the glycolytic potential Gp ot P (t) that is responsible for the
transition of proliferative cells to the hypoxic zone:
dP(t)
= fP (t) − Gp ot P (t) · P(t) · aH (ρ).
(4)

The glycolytic potential Gp ot P (t) expresses the conversion
rate of proliferative to hypoxic cells and its form in (5) depends
on the oxygen and lactate local concentrations [O(t)+La(t)]; it
is reduced by the oxygen’s net consumption rate in the proliferative region (last factor), which according to Michaelis–Menten
theory is proportional to oxygen’s spatiotemporal concentration

In these equations, O(t) and La(t) denote the mean concentrations of oxygen and lactate, respectively, in the proliferative

zone (estimated based on the nutrients diffusion equations), ρ is
the proliferation rate constant, and aH (ρ) is the conversion rate
of proliferative cells to hypoxic proportional to the proliferation
rate constant.
2) Hypoxic Region Assumptions: The hypoxic zone is characterized by limited availability of oxygen. The hypoxic cells
do not proliferate and are considered to consume only glucose,
since they almost exclusively follow the anaerobic metabolism
of glycolysis. This metabolic pathway is known to produce lactate, which then escapes to the proliferation zone. Based on these
assumptions the hypoxic region of the proposed model is characterized by nutrient diffusion for all the three chemicals plus
glucose consumption and lactate production. The nutrients concentration changes within the hypoxic zone for glucose, lactate
and oxygen are expressed by the following diffusion equations:


Gl(r, t)
∂Gl(r, t)

(7)
where Gl(r,t) stands for the glucose concentration at hypoxic
tumor point r, at time t, KGl corresponds to the initial maximum
glucose concentration outside the tumor (reference value), VGl
is the glucose maximum consumption rate by the hypoxic cancer
cells, and Hd (r, t) stands for the hypoxic cells density, calculated from their population and the current hypoxic volume.
In the diffusion equation, which governs lactate concentration
changes the production of lactate by the hypoxic cells has been
included via a Michaelis–Menten factor


La(r, t)
∂La(r, t)
= DLa ∇2 La(r, t) + PLa ·
Hd (r, t)
∂t
La(r, t) + KLa
(8)
where, La(r,t) corresponds to the lactate concentration at hypoxic tumor point r, at time t, and PLa is the lactate production
rate by the hypoxic cells, estimated by means of glucose consumption rate according to the glycolysis-process stoichiometry, which defines the production rate of lactate as two times the
consumption rate of glucose.
Finally, the change in oxygen concentration O(r,t) in a
hypoxic-zone point is subjected only to diffusion [such as in
(3)], since the hypoxic cells are assumed to fully perform anaerobic metabolism. The oxygen diffusion coefficient is the same
as in (3), since the nutrients diffusion rates have been assumed
constant throughout the entire medium.
The cell population in the hypoxic region H(t) increases due
to the conversion of proliferative cells to hypoxic cells because
of oxygen inadequacy. However, this population gradually decreases, since hypoxic cells turn to necrotic due to the limited
availability of glucose. The associated (9) describes the hypoxic
cell population change with respect to: 1) the glycolytic potential
Gp ot P (t) of the proliferative zone, which causes the transition of
cells to the hypoxic zone and 2) the hypoxic glycolytic potential
Gp ot H (t) that is responsible for the necrosis of hypoxic cells

3) Necrotic Region Assumptions: The tumor cells in the
necrotic zone are not alive, thus they do not proliferate and
do not consume any nutrients. Hence, only nutrients’ diffusion
is relevant in this area, described as follows:

4) Extra-Tumoral Region Assumptions: Concerning the
extra-tumoral area, where the tumor will expand in the next time
interval, in order to simulate the supply of oxygen and glucose
from the healthy extra-tumoral tissue, a nutrient source has been
assumed to exist outside the tumor. Hence, the diffusion equations of oxygen and glucose contain a production term, which
represents the nutrients production through the extracellular material of the normal tissue and are formed, respectively, as

A. Experimental Results

where PO , PGl are the oxygen and glucose production rates
outside the tumor, f stands for the extracellular matrix concentration, and rB is a relatively large radius value (compared to
the maximum tumor radius), which defines the healthy tissue
boundary far away from the tumor.
Finally, lactate is subjected only to diffusion [such as in (3)]
from the tumor toward the extra-tumoral region.
B. Parameter Estimation
The initial tumor size (radius) in our simulation experiments
was assumed at r = 1 cm = 10 mm (5 mm for the necrotic
zone, plus 3 mm for hypoxic zone and 2 mm for the external
proliferative zone), which corresponds to a clinically detectable
size (see Fig. 2). Additionally, the initial cell population was
estimated in each region based on an indicative tumor cells
density corresponding to C0 = 105 cells/mm3 distributed over
the considered volumes. Similarly, the proliferative population
carrying capacity was estimated by means of the literature-based
reference value of tissue carrying capacity Cm and the current
volume of the proliferative zone. The initial oxygen and glucose
concentrations were assumed as zero inside the tumor and maximum outside its boundaries, as opposed for lactate. Parameter
values used for the model simulations were derived from related
literature [5], [8], [10], [12], [13], [29], [32]–[42]. However,
some hard-to-obtain parameters were estimated according to
related known values. The parameter values that were used in
the equations of our model are summarized in Table I. The
expansion of the tumor volume (and its final radius) is estimated

The model was tested for its ability to predict the tumor
growth within each zone, under different proliferation rate constants, namely, 0.12, 1, 2, 3, and 5.2 per day as proposed in
related literature [13]. The rationale behind studying different proliferation rate cases is that it constitutes a significant
growth factor being directly associated to histological features
of paramount importance, such as the cellular mitosis rate, nuclear pleomorphism, necrosis, and histological grade of the tumor [43]. The ultimate goal of the test performed is to check
if our proposed model that controls separate regions through
the glycolytic potential can effectively simulate and predict the
tumor growth in real cases. Nutrients’ concentration changes
are subjected to second-order partial differential diffusion equations, which can be solved using numerical methods. The nutrients’ compartmental equations of the proposed model have
been numerically approximated by means of the mathematical
framework of finite differences. More specifically, the implicit
scheme of forward Euler has been implemented to solve the
equations of oxygen, glucose, and lactate concentrations. Several simulations have been performed for the evolution times of
1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The simulation grid dimensions
were defined as dr = 1 mm and the time step was defined as
dt = 0.001 day (1 min). The simulation results have been followed up by medical experts, and the model prediction is found
consistent to the clinical observation regarding the expansion
of slowly and rapidly evolving tumors, which are histologically
associated to low- and high-grade gliomas, respectively. The
results of the tumor expansion, including the separate zones,
as well as the cell populations in each tumor region for the
proliferation rates of 0.12, 1, and 5.2 per day are graphically

illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 for the evolution times of 1, 6, and
12 months. More results concerning intermediate evolution
times and proliferation rates are reported in Table II.
The first line of Fig. 4 illustrates the evolution of a tumor with
low proliferation rate (ρ = 0.12 per day) 1, 6, and 12 months,
respectively, after its assumed detection. It can be noticed that
the entire tumor radius, as well as each zone separately, slightly
change owing to the low cell proliferation and the slow transition of tumor cells from one zone to another. This fact is verified
in the first line of Fig. 3, where the corresponding cell population changes along with the tumor and necrosis growth rate are
depicted with respect to time. It is demonstrated that the prolifer-

1111

ative cell population constantly increases during the simulation
time of one year, reflecting the relatively small tumor expansion.
It is also shown that hypoxic and necrotic populations do not
change dramatically.
In the second line of Fig. 4, a different tumor growth pattern
is depicted. The proliferation rate is now higher (ρ = 1 per day)
and the tumor radius significantly increases over time, with the
necrotic region having the most extensive evolution. In second
line of Fig. 3, it can be noticed that initially the proliferative
compartment grows rapidly, leading to a high tumor growth rate.
In accordance to the tumor radius, the significant increase of the
total cell population with respect to time is demonstrated, along
with all the particular cell population changes. However, the
proliferative population starts decreasing after the time period of
four months, due to the increasing transition of proliferative cells
to the hypoxic zone, which is the result of insufficient sources
of oxygen. As opposed to the proliferative cells, the hypoxic
ones keep increasing until they reach a maximum population
in the end of the eighth month. After the ninth month, it starts
decreasing due to the lack of sufficient amount of glucose. As far
as the necrotic population is concerned, it follows a continuously
ascending pattern.
Observing the third line of Figs. 3 and 4, it can be clearly
noticed that when the proliferation rate holds the highest value
of ρ = 5.2 per day, the tumor evolution is considerably fast.
Initially, all the separate zones increase rapidly. However, upon
development of hypoxic and necrotic regions, the proliferative
shell thickness quickly stabilizes and remains remarkably thin
in comparison to the radius of the other regions. Hence, after
one month, the proliferative zone decreases due to the turn of
proliferative cells to hypoxic ones (third line/right column of
Fig. 3). Similarly, the hypoxic cells reach a maximum population
in the end of the second month, when they start descending.
Moreover, the necrotic zone reveals a rapid growth during the
first 2 months (third line/left column of Fig. 3) because of the
quick depletion of oxygen and glucose within the other zones.
After that interval, it appears to reach an upper limit, which
means that there is no further significant growth. This is the
time when the entire tumor reaches its steady state and the
necrotic region occupies most of its entire body.
Table II presents a thorough radius growth for each case in
order to unfold the differences in the evolution patterns corresponding to the different proliferation rate values.
B. Model Validation
Model validation constitutes an essential part of mathematical modeling, and it can be performed using either medical data
stemming from actual clinical cases or experimental model results available in the literature. The validation of our model is
performed using both of the above schemes using experimental
results from other studies and clinical data.
First, the results of the proposed model are graphically compared to the outputs of the model in [15], which demonstrate
three tumor growth cases, associated with different values of
a parameter χ. This parameter χ is explicitly associated with
the cell population growth rate, since higher values represent

larger cell population (and consequently tumor) growth rates.
On the other hand, in our approach the tumor growth rate is associated with the different cell proliferation rate. Similar to our
consideration, the approach in [15] considers a spherical volume of separate regions, building on the cellular metabolism,
proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, but it does not
considers glycolysis. Through this comparison, we attempt to
validate the ability of glycolytic potential and its proposed influence on the spatiotemporal growth of such distinct tumor areas.

Notice here that other continuum models in the literature, based
on diffusion of cell densities provide mixed-population regions
that cannot be readily mapped to tumor-related compartments
without imposing strict thresholds on population densities, so
that they cannot be easily compared with the results of our
model. In Fig. 5, we compare the experimental growth results of
the two approaches considering three proliferation rates, revealing high correlations concerning the different spatiotemporal
evolution patterns.
At this stage, we attempt to evaluate the influence of the incorporated effects, namely, Sonveaux, Pasteur, and Warburg, on
the overall tumor growth. For this purpose, we consider different
modeling scenarios that selectively exclude these effects from
the model. More specifically, the following modeling scenarios
were simulated.
1) Scenario 1: Excluding Sonveaux and Pasteur Effects: This
scenario assumes that proliferative cells do not consume lactate, i.e., Sonveaux observation is not modeled. Alternatively,
proliferative cells consume glucose and produce lactate, performing anaerobic metabolism (glycolysis) despite the excess
of oxygen. Consequently, the Pasteur effect that associates high

Scenario

oxygen concentration with the reduction of glycolytic activity
is also excluded. Similarly, hypoxic cells follow the anaerobic
pathway consuming only glucose and producing lactate. This
overconsumption soon leads to limited availability and latter
absence of glucose, resulting to the necrosis of hypoxic but also
proliferative cells. Overall, the cell population in the proliferative region increases due to reduced cell proliferation according
to the change of the glucose concentration in this zone. Proliferative cells also decrease in population, as they become necrotic
due to the reduction of glucose supplies. On the other hand, the
cell population in the hypoxic region rapidly decreases, since
hypoxic cells turn to necrotic due to glucose inadequacy. In
this scenario, proliferative cells do not convert to hypoxic, since
either type does use oxygen. The equations that express the
cell population changes and the related glycolytic potential factors are presented in Table III, where the parameter notation
and initial values have been described in Section II. The factor
NPot P (t) represents the necrotic potential of the proliferative
cells and corresponds to their necrosis rate when glucose is
substantially reduced.
2) Scenario 2: Excluding Sonveaux and Warburg Effects:
This scenario assumes that proliferative cells consume glucose
(Sonveaux exclusion) but through aerobic metabolism, i.e., they
consume oxygen as well. Hypoxic cells follow exactly the same
metabolic pathway consuming glucose and oxygen, so that the
Warburg effect (that cancer cells “prefer” anaerobic glycolysis) is not modeled at all. Since proliferative and hypoxic cells
consume glucose and oxygen, we expect that the tumor will experience nutrients’ inadequacy, which will lead to the necrosis of
viable cells. Hence, the proliferative cell population increases
owing to reduced cell proliferation according to the change
of the glucose and oxygen concentration in the proliferative
zone. However, this population also decreases as proliferative
cells convert to hypoxic due to the reduction of oxygen, and
additionally, they become necrotic when glucose supplies are
depleted. Regarding the hypoxic cells, their number increases
by the conversion of proliferative cells and decreases due to
glucose and/or oxygen shortage. The related equations are depicted in Table III, while the parameter values are the same as

is assumed significantly lower due to the aerobic metabolism,
namely, VGl = 11.5 × 10−13 mol/(cell·day).
The simulation results of modeling scenarios 1 and 2 are
demonstrated in Fig. 6, where the tumor’s expansion after
12 months and the growth rate with respect to time are depicted
under the three proliferation rate (ρ) values of Fig. 5. Moreover,
Fig. 7 illustrates the comparison of the proposed model’s tumor growth rate to the growth rate derived by the two different
modeling scenarios, under the same proliferation rates.
Regarding modeling scenario 1, the first line of Fig. 6 and
specifically the first and second columns demonstrate the evolution of the low proliferation rate tumor for the simulation time
of 12 months. It is shown that the tumor radius has slightly
increased. However, as opposed to the respective results (see
Fig. 3) of the proposed model, the growth rate keeps increasing.
This is due to the fact that all hypoxic cells have died due to
their inability to reach glucose, thus all glucose reserve is available for consumption by the proliferative cells. Additionally,
since proliferative cells do not convert to hypoxic (anaerobic
metabolism), their population is gradually increased. Finally,
the necrosis evolution rate pattern reflects the initial and fast
hypoxic cells necrosis.
In the second line of Fig. 6 (first and second columns), the tumor growth pattern is different for the medium proliferation rate
(ρ = 1 per day). The tumor growth rate significantly increases
until the time period of 6 months when it starts following a
descending form due to the glucose inadequacy, while necrosis evolution rate is considerably low with slight fluctuations.
At the end of simulation time, the tumor still demonstrates a
large expansion rate and the proliferative region occupies most
of its entire body, since the hypoxic region has vanished and the
necrotic core is relatively limited. This outcome reveals an un-

realistic tumor growth pattern and composition, which differs
remarkably from the respective result of the proposed model
(second line of Figs. 3 and 4), as it is also demonstrated in the
comparative plot of Fig. 7.
It is noticed in the third line of Fig. 6 (ρ = 5.2 per day) that
in this model the tumor rapidly grows until the end of the first
month, when the growth rate starts descending to finally become
zero. Thus, during the first month the tumor reaches a maximum
size, which happens to be the size of the whole extra-tumoral

area (r = 60 mm), namely, the tumor has already occupied the
entire medium. At this stage, the tumor stops growing just because it is constrained by the boundary of the medium, which
in the case of glioma tumors corresponds to the skull. Concerning necrosis, its expansion rate is low and almost constant
throughout the entire simulation time, which reflects an unrealistic effect for a rapidly expanding tumor. Moreover, it can be
clearly observed from Fig. 7 that the radius evolution pattern
is quite different from the one derived by the respective simulation of the proposed model within the period of 12 months.
Additionally, the tumor composition follows different cell population proportions compared to the proposed model, where the
necrotic core has occupied almost the entire tumor area (third
line of Fig. 4).
As far as the modeling scenario 2 is concerned, the third and
fourth columns of Fig. 6 demonstrate an approximately similar
tumor growth rate pattern for the three proliferation rate cases,
i.e., the expansion rate is initially increased, later decreased,
and finally stabilized, differing in duration and magnitude for
the different time intervals. Moreover, the necrotic core follows
an increasing growth rate during the first month while this rate
descends until the end of the second month, despite the different
proliferation rate values. This is due to the lack of sufficient
nutrients amounts in the hypoxic zone, which leads to their
fast necrosis. Unlike the hypoxic cells, the proliferative cells
continue surviving, since they have full access to glucose and
oxygen reserves and thus the conversion rate to hypoxic cells
is initially low. As opposed to the proposed model results for

the high proliferation rate tumors (ρ = 1, 5.2 per day) (second
and third lines of Fig. 4), after 12 months the viable cells and
especially the proliferative cells occupy the largest tumor area,
while necrosis has not been significantly expanded. Notice that
such tumor composition is not representative of a high-grade
tumor [8], [44]. Finally, it can be clearly observed in Fig. 7 that
the rapidly growing tumor (ρ = 5.2 per day) keeps expanding
even after a wide time interval, such as 10 months, in contrast to
the proposed model outcome, where the tumor has reached an
upper limit with no further growth mainly consisting of necrotic
cells (third line of Fig. 4).
We should mention here that we have tested two more scenarios in a similar quest, one excluding only the Sonveaux and the
other excluding only the Wartburg effect. As before, the results
indicate inability of these models to adhere to the realistic growth
rate and tumor progression, despite the use of various proliferation rates. In particular, scenario 3 (Sonveaux exclusion) assumes that proliferative cells consume glucose through aerobic
metabolism, while hypoxic cells follow the glycolytic pathway.
This simulation leads to an unnaturally low tumor growth rate
irrespective of the actual value of the proliferation rate, since the
proliferative cell population is quickly reduced due to oxygen
and glucose shortage. Finally, scenario 4 (Warburg exclusion)
considers that only proliferative cells consume lactate, while
hypoxic cells perform aerobic metabolism consuming oxygen
along with glucose. In this case, lactate (proliferative cells nutrient) is produced by none of viable cells, since all of them
follow the aerobic metabolism. As a result, the lactate reserve is
rapidly depleted, leading to the death of proliferative cells and
to unrealistic rapid necrosis of the entire tumor.
For further validation, MRI slices were selected from two
patients diagnosed with malignant glioblastoma. The MRI images were provided by the Department of Oncology in General
Hospital of Chania “Agios Georgios” and were acquired during
diagnostic and monitoring procedures (see Fig. 8). The patients
have approved the use of data for research purposes and have
given written informed consent. In both cases, the actual tumor
and necrosis maximum expansion over a time course with no
therapy is compared to the respective model results in Table IV,
where x is the initial tumor radius and y the initial necrosis radius. Additionally, the real tumor growth is also compared to the
results of the modeling scenarios 1 and 2 within the same table.
The model (and its alternative modeling scenarios) initialization
for the radii of the tumors and the necrotic regions is based on the
corresponding maximum initial radii of the real tumors. These

radii are directly derived from the medical files of the patients,
where the maximum diameter is stated according to the radiology report and is based on tumor “Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors” [44]. The real tumors are characterized by
different growth rates, i.e., the first case correspond to a low expansion rate, while the second tumor to a very high one. Under
this fact, we assigned different values to the proliferation rate
constant, namely, the lower value (ρ = 0.12 per day) was associated to the first tumor and the highest value (ρ = 5.2 per day)
was applied to the second one. The results of our model have
been thoroughly examined by the same clinicians responsible
for the patients, who confirmed that they are consistent with the
actual growth patterns. As opposed to this outcome, modeling
scenarios 1 and 2 results demonstrate considerable divergence
concerning the actual tumor and necrosis expansion. Hence,
both scenarios fail to adhere to the progression patterns of the
two cancer cases considered.
Moreover, the same medical experts support the clinical significance of our model’s prediction, since using this tool and
based on histology and imaging data they can easily estimate
the spatiotemporal expansion of early tumors and therefore improve the selection of the most appropriate primary therapeutic
option for the best outcome of the patient.
IV. DISCUSSION
Computational modeling of glioma growth has been fast progressed within the past 15 years. Current modeling approaches
have proposed several equations simulating tumor evolution
and including different biological effects. Our model effectively studies the glycolytic behavior of each tumor zone (proliferative, hypoxic, and necrotic) under different cell proliferation rates. The proposed model is based on rather simple and
computationally efficient mathematical formulation, which,
however, derives reliable results in accordance to clinical assumptions and considerations. The model simulation results
illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 and Table II demonstrate the cell
population changes and the evolution of tumor radius for the
different proliferation-rate values and time periods, reflecting
the per-zone as well the overall tumor-evolution pattern. Initially, the tumor growth is fast for all the simulated proliferation
rates, while it slows down after a certain period depending on
the proliferation rate. Additionally, it is clearly observed that
the higher the proliferation rate, the more rapid the tumor ex-

1116

pansion, so that the tumor reaches faster its steady state with
no significant further expansion. However, apart from the entire
tumor evolution, the high proliferation values lead to increasing
necrosis. This ascertainment can be justified from the fact that a
high proliferation rate generates a larger cell population, which
is characterized by increased nutrient needs in order to survive.
This inevitably leads to nutrients’ inadequacies that accelerate
the transition between the tumor zones.
The proposed model embeds the innovative factor of the glycolytic potential of cancer cells and its influence on the growth
of each tumor zone. It also supports interactions between the
different tumor regions based on the transition of the cancer
cells from one zone to another, owing to nutrients’ inadequacy.
Moreover, it adopts the well-established Warburg and Pasteur
effects, while it incorporates the recently validated observation
that proliferative cells borrow their glucose to hypoxic cells in
order for them to initiate glycolysis [28]. The proposed approach
derives reliable results in terms of clinical expectations and provides the ability to study the tumor growth compartmentally (at
zone level), but also as a complete system in terms of cell population changes. Another novel feature of this model concerns
the combination of the reaction–diffusion concept of nutrients’
variability and the kinetic factor of Michaelis–Menten within the
proposed cellular glycolytic factor. Both of these concepts have
been proven as being directly engaged in tumor growth. Finally,
our model is rather simple and understandable by the clinicians.
It does not involve the kinetic parameters of all enzymatic reactions of the glycolysis pathway, which are hard and risky to estimate experimentally, but estimates only parameters associated
with glucose and lactate. Hence, it engages a small number of
input parameters and, although it is not superior to models with
explicit details of networks and reactions in terms of prediction
performance and results accuracy, our model is characterized
by implementation simplicity and computational efficiency.
V. CONCLUSION
Gliomas form an important class of brain cancer leading to
high mortality rates. Mathematical models are increasingly used
to explore, predict, and prognose their behavior. Toward this
direction, a new continuum spherical mathematical model of
avascular glioma growth is developed in this study, which can
be adapted to real clinical scenarios. This model simulates malignant cell proliferation behavior, incorporating the interactions
between the populations of three different glioma cell phenotypes, namely, proliferative, hypoxic, and necrotic, as well as
their tissue microenvironment through the novel factor of the cell
glycolytic potential. The glycolytic potential enters the model
in the form of Michaelis–Menten kinetic theory involving the
effect of specific nutrients, such as oxygen, glucose, and lactate
on cell proliferation/survival and consequently on the overall
tumor expansion. The transition of cell populations (population
changes) among compartments is implemented by means of
Michaelis–Menten forms reflected by the glycolytic potential,
while the nutrients concentration changes are simulated exploiting chemical compartments based on the diffusion equations of
[10] and [12].

This study examines the impact of glycolysis on a developed
(1 cm radius) solid tumor growth, through the incorporation of
a glycolytic potential of tumor cells in each one of the three different zones. This formulation adopts the Warburg and Pasteur
effects along with the validated association of glycolysis with
hypoxia. It also acknowledges glycolysis to be directly related
to the diffusion/consumption of nutrients, such as oxygen, glucose, and lactate that, in turn, affect tumor growth. The proposed
model allows performing patient-specific simulation of different
tumor evolution scenarios, toward reliable prognosis of glioma
spatiotemporal progression. Since it explicitly incorporates the
microenvironment interactions of proliferative and hypoxic cells
along with the formation of necrosis, it allows evaluating clinically significant tumor sizes and efficiently describing the dynamics of glioma tumors visualized with medical imaging.
Several simulations have been performed, and the model results are presented for different evolution times in order to determine sensitivity to changes in important model parameters, such
as the proliferation rate. The model results were evaluated by
clinical experts on two actual cases of different progression patterns. According to the medical evaluation, our model is successful in capturing avascular tumor growth observed clinically and
is capable of characterizing the phenotype differentiation based
on the transition of cancer cells between the different tumor
zones. This model is further validated on specific experimental
results available in the literature, revealing high concordance
of our results with different aspects of glioma spatiotemporal
evolution. Additionally, the metabolic effects that are incorporated in our model, namely, Sonveaux, Pasteur, and Warburg,
were evaluated through the implementation and simulation of
different modeling scenarios by excluding relevant combinations of these effects. The corresponding results demonstrate
that without the inclusion of all three effects, as in our proposed
model, the tumor spatiotemporal expansion is not consistent
to the clinical observations and lead to unrealistic predictions.
Based on these initial results and following more extensive evaluation, the proposed model may constitute an important research
tool for clinical assessment with the aim to contribute toward
personalized medical treatment. In this regard, it can also be
exploited in cooperation with in vivo tumor studies, carried out
through tightly controlled experimental conditions, as to allow
the derivation of important patient-specific parameters, such as
the proliferation and the nutrients’ consumption rates that are essential for accurate personalized prognosis and treatment. Thus,
the model’s prediction could assist in critical decisions to help
in individualizing treatment options for a patient.
