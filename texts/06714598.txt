Abstract—Rectangular pulses applied to disk electrodes result
in high current density at the edges of the disk, which can lead
to electrode corrosion and tissue damage. We explored a method
for reducing current density and corrosion, by varying the leading
edge of the current pulse. Finite-element modeling and mathematical analysis were used to predict an optimal waveform that reduces
current density at the edge while also maintaining short pulse duration. An approximation of the optimized waveform was implemented experimentally and applied to platinum disk electrodes.
Surface analysis using energy-dispersive spectroscopy showed significant reduction of corrosion on the periphery of these electrodes
after pulsing, compared to those pulsed with the control rectangular waveform.
Index Terms—Biomedical electrodes, current density, double
layer, edge effect, neural stimulation.

I. INTRODUCTION
ISK electrodes are commonly used in biomedical and electrochemical applications. Current density and potential
distributions on the electrode–electrolyte interface have been
carefully examined [1]–[4]. Newman’s analytical solution concludes that the electric field and thus current density are both
sharply enhanced at the periphery of the electrode [1]. He shows
that the primary current density exhibits a singularity at the very
edge, whereas being only half the average value at the center of
the disk. While methods like charge balanced biphasic stimulation, etc., have become the norm to reduce charge accumulation,
it does not prevent the locally enhanced current density to drive
electrochemical reactions at the disk’s edge and thus corrode
the periphery of the electrode. Tissue damage due to localized
stimulation is of concern in biomedical applications [5], [6].
Several different approaches to reduce this undesired behavior have been proposed, mainly by altering the geometric design

of the electrode [4], [6]–[10]. The segmented circular electrode
consists of a set of annular rings around a central circular electrode. By placing resistors in series with the conducting line to
each segment, current can be distributed more evenly [4]. Gradient of resistivity on surface achieves the same goal [6], [11].
Designs of electrode recessed into the substrate have been discussed by several groups, with the focus on reducing the nonuniformity of current density on the surface of the electrode but not
necessarily at the aperture of the recess [7]–[10], [12]. Application of a resistive layer over the electrode surface has shown
a more uniform current density distribution in certain applications [10], [13], [14]; however, this might increase the overall
impedance to an unacceptable level.
In these methods, the main focus is altering the primary current distribution, while the secondary distribution due to the
double layer capacitance and Faradaic reactions are not taken
into considerations. These two components of the electrode–
electrolyte interface cause the primary current distribution to redistribute to a more uniform secondary profile [3], [15], [16], but
these components have only recently been considered in modeling studies [17]–[19]. Behrend et al. have proposed an approach
to achieve more uniform current density profiles by reshaping,
i.e., slowing, the rising edge of the input current pulse [18],
while a similar idea was explored for voltage pulses [19]. In
an earlier study, we have quantitatively examined this approach
utilizing a finite-element modeling (FEM) technique and shown
that a simple ramp (in place of a step) can reduce the edge
effect [20].
In this study, an optimized current distribution method was
achieved. A FEM study compared the effect of different waveforms and transition lengths. Mathematical analysis further
demonstrated the spatial and temporal factors contributing to
the nonuniformity of current distribution, leading to an optimal
current waveform via numerical solution. Finally, an approximation of the optimized waveform was implemented and applied
to platinum disk electrodes, which showed a significant reduction of corrosion on the periphery (versus electrodes pulsed with
rectangular pulses).

one proposed by Behrend et al. [18] with slight improvements [20]. See [18, Figs. 1–3] and [20, Fig. 1] for details
and validation of the FEM method. In short, an axial-symmetric

Burlington, MA), with a disk electrode of radius a embedded
in and coplanar with a flat insulating substrate. The electrode–
electrolyte interface consisted of distributed impedance with
a capacitive component γ as the double layer capacitance per
unit area. The electrolyte above the electrode was limited to
a semispherical space with a radius of 20a, and the rest of
the semi-infinite space was approximated and replaced with a
series resistance leading to the distant ground. The input current waveforms applied to the disk electrode were given by
functions specified within the model. For data analysis, results
were exported to MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). All
space and time variables were normalized to disk’s radius a and
electrode’s characteristic time constant τ . The time constant is
defined by the electrolyte resistance Rs and the double layer
capacitance Cdl :

2) Current Waveforms: Input waveforms include the standard step input as control and waveforms with different rising
edges. Three different waveforms were tested in combination
with three different transition times T , which were set to τ /2, τ ,
or 2τ . The test waveforms include linear ramp (Ramp), exponential increase (ExpInc), and the cumulative distribution function
of exponential distribution (ExpCDF), which are described as

All current pulses reached the same steady-state (SS) amplitude I0 . Fig. 1 shows the three different waveforms with
transition time equal to τ for instance. The Ramp was tested
in the previous study [20], and is included for comparison. It
has abrupt transitions at both beginning and end of the ramp.
In contrast, the ExpInc and ExpCDF waveforms were chosen
to test the effect of having smooth versus abrupt transitions at
the beginning or end of ramping phase. Their time constants
τX were both set to 1/6 of the corresponding transition length.
This choice of the time constant makes the ExpInc waveform
start at less than 0.25% of I0 , and the ExpCDF waveform reach
99.75% of I0 , to smooth the beginning and end of transition,
respectively. The waveforms themselves would assure abrupt
transition on the other side. In the modeling and mathematical
analysis, waveform shaping was studied on only the leading
edge of the step input, and results for both monophasic and

A small annular region on the edge was excluded due to the
singularity and the analysis was performed over the region of
r ≤ 0.9995a.
Besides the maxima, the area-weighted average of surplus
current density compared to an SS average value was calculated
and normalized to present the current amplitude that exceeded
the desired uniform SS distribution. This dimensionless value is
defined as current overload (CO):

which gives an indication of how much damage would be caused
by the edge enhancement if average current density was to be
used as the safety limits of the electrode. A more comprehensive

2256

analysis could also include corrosion or other damage as a
weight function in the calculation of CO, which is not discussed
here.
B. Mathematical Analysis
1) Current Step Response (SR) of Disk Electrodes: Nisancioglu and Newman analyzed the SR of a disk electrode subject
to current input utilizing the transition from cylindrical coordinates to rotational elliptic coordinates and gave analytical solutions [3]. Both double layer capacitance and Faradaic reactions
were included.
Our further analysis assumes no Faradaic reactions, however,
due to its minimal effect on the spatial and temporal distributions of current density (results not shown). Typical microelectrodes in neural engineering application work with pulses in
the micro- to millisecond range, with Faradaic reactions having
much smaller conductance compared to the electrolyte conductance. In the one time constant model of electrodes, the parallel
resistance of the reactions is in the megaohm to gigaohm range
(i.e., a low conductance), compared to kiloohm values of the
series resistance of the electrolyte (i.e., higher conductance).
Also, most electrodes used in neural implants are highly capacitive (or pseudocapacitive) as Faradaic reactions are not desired
due to their irreversibility and potential harm to tissue.
Solving for the SR involves decomposing it into SS and transient (TZ) components [3], here with the current density given
as example:
J0SR (r, t) = J0SS · u (t) − J0TZ (r, t) .

(10)

The first term represents the stable response to a constant current of amplitude I0 , i.e., secondary distribution. The transient
response does not contribute to the overall current input to the
electrode. However, it is responsible for the actual distribution
of current density on the electrode surface and its shift from
the initial condition immediately after the input onset (t = 0+ )
to SS distribution, i.e., primary to secondary. As the boundary condition of the electrode–electrolyte interface is described
with a first-order differential equation with respect to time, the
transient component is further decomposed into eigensolutions.
This will be further discussed in Section III.
2) Constructing Arbitrary Response From the SR: For any
input x (t), the output y (t) could be given by the convolution
of the input and the impulse response h (t) as
y (t) = x (t) ∗h (t)

or alternatively by the SR g (t) = h (t) dt as
y (t) = x (0) · g (t) + ẋ (t) ∗ g (t) .

(11)

(12)

The desired current waveform will reduce the current density nonuniformity; therefore, the input I (t) = I0 · x (t) should
satisfy the following conditions:
⎧
x (t) = 0,
t≤0
⎪
⎪
⎨
x (t) ↑∈ C (R) ,
t≥0
(13)
⎪
⎪
⎩ x (t) → 1,
within short t.

The second criterion states that x (t) is continuous and increases monotonically. The last criterion indicates a reasonably
short transition time period for the input current to converge to
its final amplitude, so that the modification to the rectangular
pulses commonly used in neural stimulation would not distort
the overall pulse shape too much. Otherwise, it may alter the
neural response to stimulation. In these applications, the initial
value of the input is conveniently set to 0, further simplifying
(12) to
y (t) = ẋ (t) ∗ g (t) .

(14)

Applying (14) to the results of (10) above, the current density
response to the arbitrary input I (t) could be given as
J0out (r, t) = J0SS · x (t) − J0TZ (r, t) ∗ ẋ (t)

(15)

which provides the mathematical foundation of the waveform
shaping method. The first term shows that the time-domain contribution of the SS component in the output is just scaled by the
input waveform, and quickly converges to the same secondary
distribution as the SR. The contribution of the transient component, which the nonuniformity of the overall current density
profile is due to, is in the second term. Hence, the high peripheral
current density could be reduced if the input’s time derivative
ẋ (t) is small in amplitude, i.e., smooth transition. The transient
component diminishes as condition (13) indicates that
ẋ (t) → 0.

(16)

3) Numeric Optimization: Due to the complexity of the analytical solution, a numeric solution has been developed to estimate the optimum waveform to reduce the local current density
overshoot above the SS situation.
The numeric method is based on a discrete-time version of
(12). The output is built by stacking scaled unit SRs carefully
so that the total response does not exceed a certain level (e.g.,
J0 ). The input is therefore determined by coefficients used to
the scale the unit SR. To implement this, the normalized SR
(simulated or analytical solution) is sampled with time intervals
Δt = 0.01τ over a long enough time (e.g., t ≥ 3τ )
J0SR (r, t) → J0SR (r, tm ) .

(17)

The calculation was again limited to r ≤ 0.9995a. An overshoot limit (OSL) is introduced to allow some tradeoff between
overshoot above the SS current density J0 during the transition
and the length of the transition time. The overshoot limit is a
number equal or larger to 1, and restricts the current density
within the analyzed region to
J0out (r, t) ≤ OSL · J0 , ∀r, t.

(18)

The flowchart for the algorithm is shown in Fig. 2, and an
example is given in Fig. 3 to show the concept of composing
the input and output. Optimal current waveforms, as well as
the best-fit ExpCDF waveforms, were calculated for several
different OSLs.

black dashed line represents the optimized input and output with the sampling
points (circles). The gray dotted lines are the underlying step inputs and SRs
that the sampled input and output are built of. At each time step, the size of the
additional step of input is first determined by the output, and then a scaled step
and SR are added to the total input and output. The lines SS and SS × OSL
in the bottom figure indicated the normalized SS response and the allowed
overshoot, which is set to 20% here for example (OSL = 1.2).

1) Circuit Setup: The best-fit ExpCDF of the optimum current waveform is implemented by converting a square voltage
pulse from a Model 2100 Isolated Pulse Stimulator (A-M Systems, Sequim, WA) into the desired waveform with a RC circuit,
which was then converted into a current pulse of the same shape
by operational amplifier and delivered to the electrode. A simplified circuit diagram is shown in Fig. 4. The RC circuit has a
variable resistor adjusting its time constant, hence the transition
time of the waveform. A buffer stage was added in between for
stability and impedance matching. For the control group, the RC
circuit was omitted, and the voltage pulses were directly applied
to the buffer stage.
2) Electrodes: An Epilepsy/Long-Term Monitoring Subdural Electrode Array (Ad-Tech Medical Instrument Corporation,
Racine, WI) was used for its consistent fabrication quality and
large electrode size. The 8 × 8 array contained platinum electrodes of 4 mm diameter, with the center of 2.3 mm diameter being exposed. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
using Gamry Reference600 (Gamry Instruments, Warminster,
PA) showed that the average access resistance of the electrode
is 220 Ω in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the average
double layer capacitance is 3.4 μF. The characteristic time constant is therefore approximately 0.75 ms. The parallel resistance
is on the order of 100 MΩ.
3) Pulsing Protocol: The electrodes were pulsed in PBS
with a thick platinum wire as a return electrode. The pulsing protocol consisted of cathodic-first biphasic pulses at a frequency
of 50 Hz for 20 min. [21]. The pulse width of each phase was
2 ms in duration. The control group was pulsed with rectangular
pulses. The test group was pulsed with ExpCDF current pulse
with a time constant of 0.4 ms, about half of the electrode’s
time constant. In both groups, the current amplitude was set so
that the potential excursion of the electrode–electrolyte interface
reached to ±1.5 V at the end of each phase. As a result, potential on the electrodes’ surface would exceed the water window
(−0.6 to 0.9 V) to cause corrosion [21]. For the test waveform,
the potential excursion across the electrode–electrolyte interface
was verified by subtracting the potential caused by ohmic drop
due to electrolyte resistance from the total measured potential.
The corresponding current levels for both situations were on
average 5 mA, equivalent to 240 μC/cm2 per phase. The sizes

of the test and control groups were five and four electrodes,
respectively, while two more unused electrodes were used for
baseline in the surface analysis.
4) Surface Analysis: After current pulsing, the electrodes
were detached from the substrate and cleaned with deionized
water. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to investigate the surface morphologies of the electrodes (JEOL JSM6610, JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody, MA). Chemical compositional
analyses of the pulsed electrodes were performed using EDS.
For each electrode, three evenly distributed diameters across
the exposed surface were randomly chosen and scanned. For
each diameter, EDS data were collected from 20 evenly spaced
spots with 15 kV acceleration voltage and 25 s collection time
at each spot. The data are equivalently from six radii, with ten
data points per radius. Atomic count percentage of platinum
and oxygen on the electrode surface were analyzed by EDAX
Genesis program (EDAX Inc., Mahwah, NJ), and transferred to
MATLAB for further analysis.

(19)

The control input resulted in peak overshoot of almost four
times SS (364.9%) before decaying to the average value. All
the different test current waveforms have much smaller peak
maximal current densities, with detailed values of Pm ax for each
waveform and transition length combination given in Table I.
The ExpInc has the least improvement of all three candidate
waveforms at each transition lengths, with peak overshoot at
least half the SS; the Ramp and ExpCDF are markedly better
than the ExpInc. The Ramp is best for short transition length
and has slightly less improvement compared to the ExpCDF for
intermediate and long transition lengths. The ExpCDF has an
extremely low peak overshoot for 2τ transition length.
The CO as function of time is given in Fig. 6. The COI
for the current step is equal to 0.0585, and the reduction for
each combination of waveform and transition length is given
in Table II. A similar trend is seen for COI compared to the

the center of the disk have larger amplitude but alter in sign
and virtually cancel out each other when they are scaled by the
coefficients C (i) and summed to form the transient solution. At
the edge however, the current density monotonically increases
in amplitude with the order of the eigensolution. This leads to
the high peripheral current density of the primary distribution.
Therefore, the desired input current waveform should reduce
the contribution of higher order eigensolutions to the transient
response as much as possible.
Equation (21) indicates that the time constant of eigensolutions decreases with increasing order. Therefore, higher order
eigensolutions’ time course have broader spectrum and contain
more high frequency components. To suppress the higher order
eigensolutions, the derivative of the input ẋ (t) should be a lowpass filter. One simple implementation is to use an ExpCDF as
explored in the modeling section, whose derivative is
ẋ (t) = Xe−X t · u (t)

eigensolutions.

peak overshoot. However, the difference between the ExpInc
and the other two waveforms is not as large, and the Ramp has
better performance compared to the ExpCDF for intermediate
transition length. Again, the ExpCDF performed extremely well
for 2τ transition length.

1) Transient Solution: The transient response of the step input is given by a further decomposition into exponential de(i)
caying eigensolutions with spatial profiles J0 (r) and time
(i)
constants τ [3]:

Each eigensolution corresponds to an eigenvalue λ(i) , which
is related to the time constant by
τ (i) = τ /Λ(i)

(21)

where Λ(i) is the normalized eigenvalue
Λ(i) = λ(i) τ.

with X = τX−1 .
A smaller X reduces the amplitude of ẋ (t), and hence the
overall transient component in the response as discussed in (15).
Furthermore, it can be demonstrated that for any i, the smaller
X is compared to λ(i) , the lesser this eigensolution contributes
to the overall response (derivation not shown). Therefore, for
effective suppression of higher order eigensolutions, the exponential decay of the input should have
X < λ(i) , i ≥ i0

(22)

Due to the normalization with τ , the normalized eigenvalues
are scaled by π/4 compared to the original values given by Nisancioglu and Newman [3]. Normalized eigenvalues are calculated in increasing order (according to increasing value), along
with their corresponding eigensolutions. The first ten normalized eigenvalues are given in Table III, and their eigensolutions
are given in Fig. 7 (generated according to [3]).
It can be observed that the current density at the edge is not
the highest for each eigensolution. The current densities toward

corresponding time constant
τX > 1/λ(i) , i ≥ i0 .

B. Mathematical Analysis

(23)

(25)

In the modeling section, ExpCDF waveforms have times constants of 1/6 of the transition time lengths. Hence, for the three
transition time lengths used, i0 s are 5, 3, and 1, respectively:
⎧
τ /12, i ≥ 5 for T = τ /2

i ≥ 3 for T = τ
< τX = τ /6,
(26)
⎪

⎪
⎩ τ /3,
i ≥ 1 for T = 2τ.
The results showed that the ExpCDF waveforms with transition time length of 2τ indeed reduced the current density maxima and COI to an extremely low level. This is further verified
in the computational optimization.
2) Computational Optimization: Based on the algorithm,
the optimal waveforms for a few OSL values are given as solid
lines in Fig. 8, with the dashed lines being their best-fit ExpCDF
waveforms. The corresponding Xs and the COI of optimal and
best-fit waveforms are shown in Table IV.
Comparing X with the eigenvalues, there will be almost no
overshoot within r ≤ 0.9995a, for X < λ(1) . For X < λ(2) ,
the overshoot is less than 40% (OSL = 1.4) of the average
SS current density. The fact that the optimum waveforms obtained by the algorithm resemble ExpCDF waveforms allows a
relative simple circuit to generate such stimulation waveforms
(see Section II).

3) Experimental Implementation: Current pulses were applied to platinum electrodes to validate the model, as described
in methods. Rectangular pulses were applied to four electrodes
and ExpCDF pulses applied to five electrodes. After pulsing,
the surface of the disk electrodes showed yellowish coloration
on the periphery in both groups, indicating corrosion due to
oxidation of platinum (see Fig. 9, arrows). This coloration was
evident in both rectangular and ExpCDF pulses.
EDS was performed on the surface, giving the atomic count
percentage of the two major identified elements: platinum and
oxygen. Fig. 10 shows the atomic count percentage values averaged across the radii within each group of electrodes versus the
radial location with the error bars showing standard deviation.
At each location, the mean oxidation levels for the test group
(black solid line), the control group (black dashed line), and the
baseline (gray solid line) were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, α = 0.05). The null-hypothesis that
the three groups have equal mean oxidation levels was rejected
at all locations (p ≤ 0.002).
Further multiple comparison tests were performed using the
Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference criterion to compare
group means and determine the source of the significant difference(s). The oxidation levels of the test group were significantly
lower on the periphery (asterisks) compared to the control group,
suggesting that the periphery current density was indeed reduced
with the test waveform. As expected, the oxidation level for the
baseline group was significantly lower, compared to either test
group or control group at any location.

points were slightly offset at each location for clarity. Error bars show standard
deviation. Asterisks indicate significant difference between test and control
groups. Filled and empty markers indicated center and periphery subgroups
within each group. The gray marker of test group is transition between center
and periphery subgroups.

ANOVA within groups shows change of oxidation level
across the radius for the test and control groups. Based on the
significant difference from ANOVA analysis, the radial locations
were divided into two subgroups: the center and periphery. For
the control group, the two outer points (asterisks) and the eight
center points showed significant difference in oxidation level,
which almost doubled from about 9.89% on average at the center to 18.07% on average on the edge. For the electrodes tested
with the modified pulse, the four outer points differ from the
five center points significantly, with one transition point in between. The transition point was statistically different from only
to two of the four peripheral points. The oxidation level stayed
relatively uniform around 9.46% in the center, only slightly increasing by one-third to 12.12% on the edge. Hence, the increase
of oxidation level for the control group is much stronger within
a narrower region compared to the test group. The baseline has
a relatively uniform oxidation level on average of 5.53% with

WANG et al.: REDUCTION OF EDGE EFFECT ON DISK ELECTRODES BY OPTIMIZED CURRENT WAVEFORM

no significant fluctuation. The previous results indicate that the
pulsing induced oxidation in both control and test pulse groups;
however, greater oxidation was noted at the edge of the control
pulse electrode.
IV. DISCUSSION
This paper provides comprehensive examination of the current waveform shaping method to reduce periphery current
density on disk electrodes. Analytical and numerical calculations yielded a prediction for an optimal waveform and transition length. Pulsing experiment verified the effectiveness of the
method on platinum electrodes.
A. Comparison of Different Approaches
FEM and analytical studies provided insight and quantitative
description to explain the mechanisms behind the current waveform shaping method. The double layer capacitance is responsible for the current density redistribution from the highly nonuniform primary distribution to the more uniform secondary distribution. The waveform shaping exploits this and increases its effect, allowing the current density to redistribute over longer time.
From the mathematical standpoint, current waveform shaping
suppresses contribution of the higher order eigensolutions to the
transient response, which the edge effect mostly relies on.
The modeling and analysis assume ideal conditions, and
therefore have certain limitations [13]. The electrodes were assumed to have perfectly smooth surfaces and an ideal seal at the
electrode–insulator interface. A rough surface would increase
the current density at locations of small curvature, therefore increasing the overall current nonuniformity. This is however a
small factor compared to the ideally infinite edge effect unless
the insulation of the electrode was very defective due to manufacturing failure. A nonperfect electrode–insulator interface
would cause leakage of current originating from the electrode–
electrolyte interface under the insulation. Nonideal electrical
properties at the edge decrease the edge effect. However, an
edge effect would exist and the current shaping method would
still help to reduce the nonuniformity.
The electrode–electrolyte interface has been simplified as
well. The double layer capacitance was assumed to be an ideal
capacitor, although it is often better described as a constant
phase element, whose parameter might vary depending on many
factors like frequency and bias potential [2], [22]. The Faradaic
components were excluded from the analysis and the FEM study.
This leads to further deviation from reality, especially for large
overpotentials, such as those used in the pulsing experiment.
The electrode was symmetric in geometry and referenced to
an infinite ground, and the conducting media were isotropic.
In reality, the electrolyte space is finite and of arbitrary geometry. In neural stimulation applications, the complex environment
of surrounding tissue may change the electrical field and current distribution. Nevertheless, the experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the current shaping method despite
the aforementioned simplifications and other factors such as the
slight recession of the electrodes used.

B. Trade-Off Considerations
Utilization of the proposed method must consider several
tradeoffs. To achieve the reduction in current density at the
periphery will require a rising leading edge, not a step. To minimize edge effects throughout the entire pulse, a transition zone
should be added wherever a discontinuity exists in the waveform, which for a rectangular pulse is at the beginning and end
of the pulse as edge effect is noted at pulse offset as well. The
total charge injection would remain the same for the modified
pulse, only increasing the overall pulse width. This has the effect of making the pulse longer. A longer pulse is generally less
efficient at stimulating nerves, so more charge may be required
for the modified pulse to have the same effect as the square
pulse. While the peak current density may be minimized, the
stimulation could be less efficient.
A secondary consideration when increasing pulse width is the
limitation this may place on pulse rate (the number of pulses
per second). For example, a pulse width of 2 ms (1 ms/phase)
can be repeated at up to 500 pps. Lengthening the pulse would
reduce the rate at which pulses can be applied. However, rarely
are pulses applied so rapidly; thus, this issue is unlikely to be
a significant limitation. For example, a microrough platinum
electrode array with 200 μm diameter has a time constant of
0.43 ms tested in vitreous or 0.98 ms when placed on the retina
in vitro [23]. The same type of electrodes in the Argus II Retinal
Prosthesis use pulse widths of 0.5 ms at rates of 20 pulses/s.
The pulse intervals are therefore 50 ms on average, and there is
enough room to accommodate a modification to the pulses.
C. Stimulation Safety and Efficacy
Reducing the edge effect may improve device safety since
neural damage is related to current and charge density. The
biological safety limit of neural stimulation is variable, and depends on both charge per phase and charge density [23]. An
analysis of experimental data has shown that stimulation is not
damaging to neurons with higher charge density when using
smaller charge per phase. On the other hand, the electrochemical
safety limit is a constant charge density. Therefore, given a small
charge per phase, smaller electrode could reach electrochemical
safety limit before biological safety limit, necessitating protection through methods like waveform shaping. Larger electrodes
may be restricted by biological safety (versus electrochemical
safety) limits, so waveform shaping may be less important in
these application.
The high current density is transient in time and limited to
near the surface of the electrode. Current nonuniformity decays
rapidly away from the electrode surface, even in the primary
distribution. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that waveform shaping will have little effect on the spatial extent of
neural response, especially in the situations where the electrodes could not be placed close enough to the stimulation target. Retinal prostheses use circular electrodes with rectangular
pulses, but the subjects do not describe annular perceptions [25].
Calcium fluorescence imaging studies of in vitro retina do not
show preferential neural activation at the edges of 0.2 mm diameter electrodes [26], [27]. In contrast, annular skin burns have

2262

been noted after defibrillation, but these electrodes are large
(several centimeters) and the skin is adjacent to the surface of
the electrode [10], [28]. With microelectrodes (less than 1 mm
in diameter), the edge effect is limited in time and space.
V. CONCLUSION
The objectives of this study were to investigate the method of
shaping current waveform to reduce periphery current density
on disk electrodes. Three approaches were used: FEM, mathematical analysis and numeric optimization, and pulsing experiment. The first two gave consistent conclusion on the optimal
waveform and transition length, and the experiment verified the
effectiveness of the method on platinum electrodes.
Further development of this method includes exploring its
efficiency on electrodes of different shapes and sizes (for example, cylindrical electrodes as used in deep brain stimulation or
cardiac pacing), engineering simple and feasible implementation of the current source, and studying the possible benefits in
potential biomedical applications.
