of Epilepsy Using Complex-Valued Classifiers
Musa Peker, Baha Sen, Senior Member, IEEE, and Dursun Delen

Abstract—The study reported herein proposes a new method
for the diagnosis of epilepsy from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals based on complex classifiers. To carry out this study, first
the features of EEG data are extracted using a dual-tree complex
wavelet transformation at different levels of granularity to obtain
size reduction. In subsequent phases, five features (based on statistical measurements maximum value, minimum value, arithmetic
mean, standard deviation, median value) are obtained by using the
feature vectors, and are presented as the input dimension to the
complex-valued neural networks. The evaluation of the proposed
method is conducted using the k-fold cross-validation methodology,
reporting on classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The
proposed method is tested using a benchmark EEG dataset, and
high accuracy rates were obtained. The stated results show that the
proposed method can be used to design an accurate classification
system for epilepsy diagnosis.
Index Terms—Complex-valued neural networks (CVANN),

I. INTRODUCTION
PILEPSY is a neurological disorder that causes an uncontrolled and involuntary movements called seizures due to
temporary electrical discharges that occur in the brain. Epilepsy
can be observed in all regions of the world, in males and females,
in all races and in one in every 100 individuals.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important diagnostic
method used to examine epileptic patients and patients with
suspicious attack problems. Brief information about history of
the EEG, EEG measurement, and used areas is presented below.
The presence of electrical activity in the brain was detected
for the first time in 1875 by Caton [1]. In 1929, Berger [2]
did a study to prove this claim. Berger, revealed the presence
of electrical activity in the human brain. He realized that with
the help of electrodes placed on the head and a galvanometer
connected to these electrodes. Then, Berger observed that these
signals called EEG are changed with the opening and closing
of the eyes. With these developments, the presence of EEG signals was scientifically proved. In 1934, Adrian and Matthews [3]

ensured of strengthening and recording of EEG signals obtained
with the electrodes. The number of research dealing with this
issue has increased day by day with the impact of the big developments in the field of electronics and computer. Today, EEG
signals are used in many areas, such as diagnosis of epilepsy,
controlling of anesthesia stage in surgical operations, and determining the depth of anesthesia, sleep disorders, investigation of
sleep psychology, and diagnosis of migraine.
Brain–computer interface is used to measure the EEG signals. The first part of this interface is metal electrodes, which
are used for measuring the electrical activity of the brain from
the head surface. Generally, measurements are made according to an electrode placement scheme called the international
10–20 system. EEG signals have very low amplitude (in μv levels) values. To be able to interpret these signs, they should be
amplified by EEG device. This amplified EEG signal is drawn
on a paper in continuous form. The recorded EEG signals are
similar to the multichannel seismograph record. Evaluation of
EEG recordings is performed by neurologists who specialized
in this subject.
The five main wave types in EEG signals are: alpha (8–13 Hz),
beta (13–30 Hz), delta (0–4 Hz), gamma (30–100+ Hz), and
theta (4–7 Hz) [4], [5]. EEG signals are not periodic and their
amplitude, phase, and frequencies change continuously. Therefore, these signals are very difficult to interpret. EEG data are
visually analyzed by neurologists [5]. This process is rather
stressful and tiresome. Also, EEG signals analyzed by neurologists who have received different training may generate inconsistent information. Therefore, it is imperative to analyze EEG
signals with a consistent and suitable method in order to ensure
correct epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this
study is to identify an algorithm with better classification accuracy than existing algorithms, and to ensure the provision of
gradable information through the use of EEGs.
The rest of the paper is organized in the following manner.
Section II presents a brief literature review about the diagnosis
of epilepsy including information regarding the method suggested in this study. Section III briefly describes the dataset of
the EEG signals employed in our research. Section IV details
the methods utilized in this study. Section V provides the experiments undertaken in the framework of this study, assessment
procedures that are used, and experiential results that are obtained. Finally, Section VI summarizes the conclusions derived
from this study and the future work.

epileptic activities. Some of the studies with high classification
accuracies are provided below. A direct comparison of our study
to those of others reported in the recent literature in terms of
classification accuracy is also given in the form of a table in the
result section of this paper.
Pradhan et al. [6] used two-layered learning vector quantization networks in order to analyze EEG signals. Petrosian et al.
[7] applied EEG signals to recurrent neural networks instead
of applying them to statistical properties in the identification
of epileptic seizures. In extracting features from EEG signals,
Srinivasan et al. [8] used five features based on time and frequency. High accuracy rates were obtained in the system, where
Elman recurrent neural network was used as a classifier. Nigam
and Graupe [9] used two feature values expressed as relative
spike amplitude and spike occurrence frequency. A multistage
nonlinear preprocessing filter was used to extract these features.
Later, these features were used as input data, especially for artificial neural networks (ANNs). Subasi and Ercelebi [10] used
both MLPNN (multilayer perceptron neural network) and logistic regression models in the identification of epileptic seizures
in the analysis of EEG signals. In another study, Subasi [11]
compared the two outputs (normal and epileptic) MLPNN, and
used a mixture of expert model in the classification of EEG data.
Kannathal et al. [12] arrived at 92% classification accuracy by
using different entropy values and an adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithm. In another study, Kannathal
et al. [13] used chaotic measures in the identification of features from EEG signals. These measures included correlation
dimension, the largest Lyapunov exponent, Hurst exponent, and
entropy values. The authors arrived at a classification accuracy
of higher than 90%. Tzallas et al. [14] employed Wigner-Ville
coefficients that have time–frequency conversion characteristics
along with ANNs for epilepsy diagnosis. Polat and Gunes [15]
proposed a hybrid model containing decision tree (DT) algorithms and a fast Fourier transformation base. Chua et al. [16]
used a variety of higher order spectral (HOS) attributes to distinguish normal, ictal, and preictal EEG signals, and they also
indicated unique ranges for these features for various classes
with high confidence level (p-value of less than 0.05). Faust
et al. [17] used Burg autoregressive coefficients in modeling of
epileptic seizures. In this study in which support vector machines
was preferred as classification algorithm, 93.33% classification
accuracy was obtained. Acharya et al. [18] used chaotic features,
such as Hurst exponent, largest Lyapunov exponent, fractal dimension, and approximate entropy (ApEn) to classify normal,
ictal, and preictal EEG signals. In this study in which SVM and
the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) algorithms were used as
classification algorithm, better results were obtained with the
GMM. The average 95% classification accuracy was obtained
with the GMM algorithm. Guo et al. [19] obtained features
from EEG signals by a relative wavelet energy (RWE) algorithm in different frequency bands. A classification accuracy of
95.2% was obtained in the system, where ANN was used as a
classifier. Acharya et al. [20], used HOS based attributes (specifically cumulants) for automatic detection of normal, ictal, and
preictal states using EEG signals. As a result, they achieved
95.5% classification accuracy. Acharya et al. [21] used ten

109

recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) attribute parameters
for the classification of the same problem. These attributes were
classified with different classification algorithms. SVM algorithm gave the best performance among these algorithms. As
a result, 95.6% classification accuracy was obtained. Acharya
et al. [22] employed wavelet coefficients and eigenvalues to
extract features from EEG signals. Wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) was utilized to obtain wavelet coefficients, and
eigenvalues were determined with the help of principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm, and later, an analysis of variance
test was implemented to select the significant eigenvalues. The
experiments were undertaken with the help of tenfold cross validation. 99% classification accuracy was obtained in the system,
where the GMM algorithm was used as a classifier. Acharya
et al. [23] proposed a method for automatic detection of normal, ictal, and preictal states using EEG signals. They used
four algorithms (ApEn, sample entropy, and two-HOS-based
entropy) in feature selection stage. Obtained attributes were
classified with seven different classification algorithms. These
algorithms are as follows: Fuzzy classifier (FC), SVM, k-nearest
neighbor (KNN), probabilistic neural network, DT, GMM, and
naive Bayes classifier. FC gave the best result in experiments
performed. As a result, three-class problem have been distinguished with 98.1% accuracy rate. Niknazar et al. [24] proposed
a RQA-based method for automatic detection of normal, ictal,
and preictal states using EEG signals. The proposed method is
based on combination of RQA-based measures of the original
signal and its subbands. As a result, 98.67% accuracy rate was
obtained. The use of complex-valued methods for the classification of EEG data was found for the first time in Peker and Sen
[25]. In their studies, they obtained eight real-valued attribute
values from EEG data. They turned these attribute values into
four attribute values in the form of complex numbers. The resulting four complex-valued attribute values are presented as
an introduction to a complex-valued neural network (CVANN).
The parameter values of the CVANN were obtained by trialand-error. The results indicate that high accuracy values were
obtained.
This study proposes a new method in the diagnosis of epilepsy
that is different from the approaches presented in the previous
studies. In this study, complex-valued classifiers are used to
diagnose epilepsy. The proposed hybrid method produced accuracy results that are better than any reported in the literature
(a comparative table is provided in the results section of this paper). The following is a short summary of our proposed method.
This study investigates the effects of complex-valued classifiers on the diagnosis of epilepsy. Complex numbers are known
to be important in the basis of signal processing. It is possible to hold this view through the Fourier transform method,
which is one of the most basic and important topics of signal
processing. The Fourier transform method works with complexvalued numbers and generates complex values as an output. If
we want to classify the outputs of this transform with a realvalued classifier, we need to present the real and virtual values
of the complex number to the input separately. This will cause
an extra load and a decrease in capacity. When complex numbers are preferred, 2-D information will be presented to the

110

network as 1-D information because complex numbers have
both real and imaginary parts. This is presented in more detail in
Section IV-B1. Sections IV-A and IV-B1 describe the advantages of these algorithms, while presenting complex-valued algorithms. In line with this information, a model that works with
complex numbers was targeted in order to classify the EEG values in high accuracy ratios. Dual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) has been applied in various levels for feature
extraction and statistical features are obtained from the obtained
complex-valued feature vector. The same number of features for
each set of EEG data is presented as entry to the CVANN. The
reason for using the DTCWT–CVANN hybrid model is related
to solving the problem with an algorithm that works completely
in the complex domain. This way, it is possible to observe the
effects of the complex-valued methods and compare them with
the real-valued methods.
III. DATA
The EEG signals used as the dataset in this study were obtained from the database of the Epileptology Department of
the University of Bonn [26]. This section provides some information regarding the data. More detailed information can be
obtained from the sources provided in [26]. All data are composed of five clusters (A–E) and each cluster consists of 23.6 s
single-channel 100 EEG segments. Clusters A and B consist
of surface EEG recordings received from five healthy volunteers, while eyes were open and closed, respectively. Cluster C
consists of EEG recordings obtained from the hippocampal opposing hemisphere of sick patients prior to seizures. Cluster D
consists of EEG recordings obtained from the epileptogenic region in the sick patients prior to seizures. Cluster E consists of
the recordings of seizures from sick volunteers. The signals were
transferred to a digital environment with a 173.61-Hz sampling
frequency (a total of 4097 samples) after being converted with
a 12-bit analog digital converter. A 0.53–40-Hz bandpass filter
was applied to the EEG signals obtained from the participants.
IV. METHOD
A. Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transformation
Discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) has a wide range of
applications, and is frequently used in many fields, such as signal and image compression, feature extraction, noise reduction,
channel coding, image processing, and the numerical solution
of partial differential equations [27], [28]. Although it offers a
proficient computational algorithm and limited representation,
the DWT displays four fundamental disadvantages compared to
DTCWT: 1) Shift sensitivity: If there is an unpredictable change
in transformation coefficients when there is a shift (change)
in the time for the input signal, this transformation is defined
based on shift sensitivity. Shift sensitivity is an unwanted characteristic. DWT coefficients are unsuccessful in differentiating
the input-signal changes [29]. DTCWT is insensitive to change.
When compared with standard DWT, it has a developed sensitivity toward shifts in time. 2) Poor directionality: Standard DWT is
unsuccessful in selecting diagonal characteristics. DTCWT has

and g0 and g1 for the imaginary part of the DTCWT coefficients.

12 wavelets (six for the real tree and six for the imaginary tree)
in two dimensions oriented in ±15°, ±45°, ±75°. 3) Absence
of phase information: One of the important shortcomings of the
DWT algorithm is the absence of phase information. All natural signals are mainly real-valued and therefore complex-valued
filtering is necessary in order to benefit from local phase information [30]. As opposed to normal wavelet transform (WT),
the DT-CWT algorithm uses complex functions instead of realvalued main wavelet functions. This way, amplitude and phase
information can be examined separately. Due to the existence
of all these problems, the use of a DTCWT was proposed by
Kingsbury et al. [31].
The DTCWT uses analytic filters to perform the wavelet analysis. DTCWT has a more complex structure compared to standard DWT, and is composed of two DWTs that work parallel to
each other, as shown in Fig. 1. One of these trees is called the
real tree, whereas the other is called the imaginary tree. DTCWT
uses a pair of filters for mother wavelet function ψ(t) and scaling function ϕ(t) and these filters are h0 (n), h1 (n), which is
the low-pass/high-pass filter pair and (g0 (n), g1 (n), which is the
low-pass/high-pass filter pair [32]. Wavelet function and scaling
functions are calculated by

ψh (t) = 2
n

√ 
φh (t) = 2
h0 (n)φh (2t − n) .

(2)

n

Together with the real and imaginary compounds, complex wavelet transformation is expressed as ψ (t) := ψh (t) +
jψg (t). Here, ψh (t) and ψg (t) are real valued. ψh (t) is calculated, as seen in (1).
If ψ (t) is almost analytic (if supported only one side of the
frequency axis), obtained conversion may have features, such
as lack of aliasing, directionality, and shift invariance as in the
Fourier transform, in which complex base functions are analytic

[31]. For ψ (t) to be approximately analytic, it is required that
one wavelet basis must be approximately equal to the Hilbert
transform of the other wavelet basis [32]. As seen in (3), ψg (t)
is designed to provide the Hilbert transformation of ψh (t) [32]
ψg (t) ≈ H{ψh (t)}.

(3)

To ensure the condition in (3), there should be approximately
half-sample distance between the low-pass analysis filters in
real and virtual trees [33]
g0 [n] ≈ hn [n − 0.5] .

To perform these operations, there are various filter design
methods in the literature, such as q-shift solution and common
factor solution. In this study, q-shift filter, which is proposed by
Kingsbury [31], was used in the filter design. Detailed information about q-shift filtering can be obtained from the [31].
B. Complex-Valued Neural Networks
First studies in the literature that present and apply CVANN
algorithm were examined and presented in this section. The
CVANN algorithm was first introduced with the announcement
of the complex least mean squares algorithm by Widrow et al.
[34]. A complex-valued learning algorithm for signal processing application was published by Kim and Guest [35]. Another
version of CVANN, incorporating a different activation function, was presented by Georgiou and Koutsougeras [36]. Nitta
[37] reports an extensive study of CVANN. The results obtained from this study are as follows. 1) Two hypersurfaces,
which intersect orthogonally, create the decision boundary of
a single-complex-valued neuron, and four equal sections are
formed in the decision region. When both the absolute values of
real and imaginary parts of the net inputs to all hidden neurons
are sufficiently large, an orthogonal intersection of three-layered
CVANN will be realized by the decision boundaries for real and
imaginary parts of an output neuron [38]. 2) Average learning
speeds of a complex backpropagation (BP) algorithm and a real
BP algorithm are different, with the former being faster. The
standard deviation of the learning speed of the complex BP and
the real BP is different, with the latter being larger. Therefore,
the CVANN and the related algorithm are natural for learning
of complex-valued patterns [38].
CVANN algorithm can be used with multilayered neural networks, where weights, threshold values, inputs, and outputs all
are complex numbers (see Fig. 3). As can be seen from Fig. 3,
the CVANN structure is actually a model of ANN that processes
complex numbers. In terms of this model, complex-valued vectors are provided as inputs for CVANN. Complex-valued output
vectors are obtained by having complex values in the weight
values situated between the input layer and the hidden layer and
between the hidden layer and the output layer, and by using
the activation function in line with the equation provided in (5).
CVANN is initiated with the help of the transmission of complex input signals or data through the connection, where each
connection has an associated weight that enhances the signal
that is transmitted, where the received signals is transformed by
each neuron (the sum of the input multiplied by the connection
weight) through an activation function, and in turn, the output

a single neuron.

signal is determined. Later, error values are minimized by updating the weight and threshold values of the network through
a complex BP algorithm. This is presented with the help of
formulas in mathematical modeling section.
1) Advantages of the CVANN Algorithm: When real-valued
ANNs are used in solving problems with complex-valued numbers, ANNs should be applied separately for real and imaginary
parts. However, when CVANNs are applied to the same problem, the operation time decreases due to the ability to operate
directly. In addition, the ratio of accuracy increases [37]. The use
of complex-valued input/output, weights, and activation functions enables an increase in the functionality and performance
of single neurons and the neural network, as well as a decrease
in training time [39]. Fig. 2 can be examined as a simple example to observe the advantages of a CVANN. The example shows
that a two-input network is reduced to one input in the case
of CVANN use. This provides the opportunity to substantially
reduce the degree of complexity in large networks and allows
speedy training. Here, z = a + ib and w = w1 + iw2. What
provides the advantage is the fact that complex numbers can
carry 2-D information in a single dimension due to having both
real and imaginary parts. As mentioned above, such a situation
will result in the decrease of the network size and in speedy
training.
In addition, to the advantages that are mentioned above, there
are other advantages of CVANN compared to real-valued neural
networks. These advantages are high-level functionality, better
plasticity, and greater flexibility. They learn faster and attain better generalizations [40]. The skill of a single neuron in CVANN
to learn input/output mappings that can be differentiated as
nonlinear in the real domain shows greater flexibility. These

112

neurons have the skill to learn without generating higher degree
inputs and progressing to a higher dimensional space.
Nitta study [41] can be examined to see the advantages of
CVANN more clearly. This study shows that the XOR problem,
which cannot be solved using two-layered real-valued neural
networks can easily be solved by using two-layered CVANN.
2) Mathematical Model of CVANN Algorithm: Brief details
about the mathematical model of CVANNs are provided below
[37], [42]
Yn active value of the neuron can be defined as


In (5), Wn m is the complex-valued connection weight between n neuron and m neuron. Im is the complex-valued input
signal of the m neuron, and θn is the complex-valued threshold
of n neuron. In order to obtain the complex-valued output signal, Yn active value is transformed into two components as real
and imaginary
(6)
Yn = x + iy = z

Here, i stands for the value of −1. When various output
functions of each neuron are considered, the output function

The learning rule for the complex-valued BP model is defined
below to minimize the square error Ep [43]. The arrangement
of weights and threshold values are designed according to the
equations provided below (where η > 0, η is a small learning
constant)
ΔVn m = −η.
Δλn = −η.
ΔWm l = −η.
Δθm = −η.

where fR (u) is called the activation function of neural network.
Let’s assume that the sigmoid function is selected as the activation function. In this case, fR (u) = 1/ (1 + exp (−u)) , u ∈ R
(R denotes the set of real numbers), the real and imaginary parts
of an output of a neuron mean the sigmoid functions of the real
part x and imaginary part y of the net input z to the neuron,
respectively.
The CVANN used in this study is composed of three layers
(input, hidden, and output layers). Fig. 3 presents the threelayered CVANN structure used in this study. Here, Wm l is the
weight between the input layer neuron l and the hidden layer
neuron m, Vn m is the weight between the hidden layer neuron
m and the output layer neuron n, θm is the threshold value for
the hidden layer neuron m, and λn is the threshold value for the
output layer neuron n. Il , Hm , On are the output values for the
input layer neuron l, the hidden layer neuron m and the output
layer neuron n, respectively. Similarly, Um and Sn are the active
values of the hidden layer neuron m and the output layer neuron
n, respectively,

Ep = (1/2)

Here, N is the number of neurons in the output layer, (δ n =

neuron, and Tn the target output. The square error also can be
rewritten as follows:

3) Activation Functions: One of the difficulties experienced
in using the BP algorithm in the complex plane is the selection of
the appropriate activation function [44]. There is no consensus
in the literature regarding which activation function should be
selected. Activation function selection depends on input training
data type and the case. This study investigates the most efficient
activation function for the problem. Literature proposes different complex activation functions. In this study, four different
activation functions were used in order to identify the activation

V. APPLICATION AND THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This study aims to increase the productivity of the CVANNs
by using DTCWT in the classification of EEG data and statistical feature extraction. The block diagram of the proposed
structure is given in Fig. 4. In order to extract the features of
data, two separate vector matrices are created with the size of
(100 segments × 4096 samples) for both dataset A (healthy)
and dataset E (epileptic activity condition). Sample numbers of
each column of A and E datasets with the size of 100 × 4096
are decreased by using three different levels of DTCWT. Five
statistical features are extracted from new dataset with reduced
size and are classified with the help of CVANN. These statistical
features are presented in Table I. In (26)–(31), xn = 1, 2, 3 . . . n
is a time series, N is the number of data points, AM is the mean

of the sample. If the number of values is odd then (30) is used
for Median. If number of values is even, then (31) is used for
Median (where N = number oﬁtems). A sample of a feature
table is presented in Table II.
In the sample given, third-level DTCWT was applied to data
of normal subjects and epilepsy patients. In this way, dataset
consisting of 4096 samples in each segment decreased to 2048
samples. In final situation, 2048 complex valued samples were
obtained. Each sample consists of real and complex coefficients.
For these coefficients, arithmetic mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values were calculated individually. For example, suppose that arithmetic mean of the real
values of 2048 samples in a segment is x and arithmetic mean
of the imaginary values is y. In this case, the value of the arithmetic mean feature will be x + yi for this sample. Other feature
values have also been calculated in this way. In the literature,
statistical features were used in real-valued WT for dimension
reduction. However, such an application has not been observed
in DTCWT applications. In addition, last column of Table II
shows the output values. The output value for epilepsy patients
is (0 + i), the output value for healthy people is (1 + i).
Since this study employs DTCWT on the data in three different levels (first, second, and third levels), there are three
problems with different input data. For ease, these three problems are called DTCWT–CVANN-1, DTCWT–CVANN-2, and
DTCWT–CVANN-3, respectively, in terms of level values. Operations undertaken during the implementation phase are listed
below.

A. Experimental Results
A computer with Intel(R) Core i7–2670QM 2.20-GHz microprocessor and 8-GB RAM is used for the solution of problems.
Parameter set displayed in Table III is selected for parameter
values for CVANN. The parameter values of the CVANN were
obtained by trial-and-error.
The first step is the calculation of root-mean-square error
(RMSE) values obtained through the best parameter results.
RMSE is used to determine the error ratio between assessment
values and model estimates, and the RMSE values close to
zero shows increase in the ability of the model for estimation.
RMSE values are presented in Table IV. It is seen that the best
results are obtained by the DTCWT–CVANN-1 method. The
other methods are also found to be effective.
The second step of this study consists of the calculation of
statistical analysis values. Table IV displays the obtained results
according to performance evaluation criteria. Best results for
average classification accuracy are obtained using DTCWT +

CVANN-1 and DTCWT + CVANN-3 algorithm for epileptic
seizure detection.
Although DTCWT + CVANN-1 and DTCWT + CVANN-3
provide the same accuracy rates, its RMSE values are different. RMSE value obtained by DTCWT + CVANN-1 method is
lower. This results shows that obtained output values and target
output values are closer and it points to the fact that the most
effective method is DTCWT + CVANN-1. Hundred percent
classification accuracy is obtained using these algorithms.
The classification accuracy rates obtained in this study and
in previous studies on the same dataset are compared, and the
analysis results are presented in Table V. Only the studies that
used the same dataset were utilized in order to achieve a reliable
and fair comparison. In this sense, only the database used in
Subasi and Ercelebi studies [10] differs. The reason for including
this study in the comparison table is related to the fact that
the authors have used the real-valued version of the proposed
method in their studies. It is possible this way to compare the
success rates of real- and complex-valued classifiers.
Generally, hold-out and k-fold cross-validation methods are
used in the selection of training and test data. As shown in
comparison tables (see Tables V and VI), the authors have performed the analysis by one of these two methods. For a fair
comparison, data selection in this study was performed using
two methods. As shown in Table V, in the classification of A–E
problem, 100% accuracy rate was obtained with the proposed
method. The results show that the proposed method produced
better results compared to those of the other studies. With regard
to important matter, such as medical diagnoses and diagnostic
systems, even a 0.1% increase in accuracy rates is very important. In addition, the proposed method seems to give good
results when the sensitivity and specificity values are analyzed.
It is observed that Tzallas et al. [14] have also achieved 100%
accuracy rate by using time–frequency analysis and artificial
neural network methods on the same dataset.
Table V shows that Subasi and Ercelebi [10] studies are impressive. It is seen that the accuracy rates obtained in this study
is higher than those of studies including real-valued wavelet
and neural networks, which is an indicator that the effect of
complex-valued classifiers is higher. Subasi and Ercelebi studies [10] does not provide information regarding the computation
time. We have mentioned that complex classifiers have important effects on the time parameter. The same experiment was

repeated to compare the computation times of the real-valued
classifiers and the proposed complex-valued classifiers.
Real-valued WT and neural networks (ANN) were used
on the same data to compare computation times. The BP
feedforward neural network was preferred for neural networks,
and various models were tried for WT. The best one was selected to be the WT that used fourth degree Daubechies wavelet.
About 92.5% classification accuracy was obtained, while using
the real-valued WT-ANN structure. The result obtained is similar to the result in [10], and the computation time was found
to be 126.4 s. For the same problem, computation times were
found to be 45.6, 40.2, and 30.9 s for the DTCWT + CVANN-1
model, the DTCWT + CVANN-2 model, and the DTCWT +
CVANN-3 model, respectively. For a fair comparison, all the
experiments were carried out on the same computer using the
same programming language.
As can be seen, the use of DTCWT + CVANN models significantly reduces computation time compared to real-valued classifiers. The difference in the computation times of DTCWT +
CVANN-1, DTCWT + CVANN-2, and DTCWT + CVANN-3
models is related to the change in the numbers of input samples provided to the CVANN input. The DTCWT + CVANN-3
model with less input has a lower computation time.
Peker and Sen [25] used complex-valued methods for classifying EEG data. There are significant differences between the
proposed method used in this study and the proposed methods
[25]. In [25], real-valued attributes were obtained to represent
EEG data, and these attributes were converted to a complex
number format. In this study, complex-valued attributes are obtained directly from EEG signals thanks to complex WT.
It can be concluded from the above results that the hybrid system combining the DTCWT + CVANN, obtains highly accurate
results in classifying the possible epileptic seizure of patients.
The advantages of DTCWT and CVANN were mentioned
separately in Sections IV-A and IV-B1. It is observed that the
DTCWT-CVANN hybrid model obtained by combining the two
models achieves the targeted success in terms of results. It is

known that the WT–ANN approach produces effective results
in the classification of EEG data [7]. However, as mentioned
in the first part of this study, it is known that complex numbers
play an important role in signal processing. In line with this idea,
the proposed method generates better results than does the realvalued WT-ANN model in terms of both accuracy rates and
computation times. It should also be mentioned that methods
other than this can also provide high classification accuracies.
Certainly there are researchers who are keen to obtain high
accuracy ratios. However, in addition to achieving high accuracy values, this study completely implemented complex-valued
methods with regard to EEG data for the first time, and obtained
successful results. In this sense, it is believed that this study will
act as a good guide to researchers in the field.
Up to this point, experiments were performed on two classes
(A and E). Analysis phase has been extended in order to see
the efficiency of the algorithm better. The effect of the proposed
method on more complex problems was also investigated. To
this end, the proposed method has been applied to four different
experiments.
Experiment 1: Three sets from the dataset were used and they
were classified into three different classes. These classes are
as follows: Healthy ones (A), epilepsy patients in seizure-free
intervals (D), and epilepsy patients (E). Notation is simplified
as A-D-E.
Experiment 2: All sets in the dataset were used and they
were classified into two different classes: A, B, C, and D sets
were included in the nonseizure class, and E set was included
in the seizure class. Notation is simplified as ABCD-E. This
classification problem is more close to clinical applications.
Experiment 3: Four sets from the dataset were used and they
were classified into two different classes. Nonseizure sets excluding healthy with eyes closed (A, C, D) were employed in
the first class and epilepsy patients with epileptic seizure (E)
was used in the second class. Notation is simplified as ACD-E.
Experiment 4: Five sets from the dataset were used and they
were classified into three different classes. These classes are as

follows: Healthy ones (AB), epilepsy patients in seizure-free
intervals (CD), and epilepsy patients with epileptic seizure (E).
Notation is simplified as AB-CD-E.
The results obtained with the proposed method for the four
different experiments are presented in Table VI. In the table,
there are also results obtained in the literature on the same
dataset. A brief evaluation of the results obtained is presented
below.
For experiment 1 (A-D-E), higher accuracy rate was obtained with the proposed method compared to the studies in
the literature. 99.3% accuracy rate was obtained with tenfold
cross-validation method and 99.04% accuracy rate was obtained
with the hold-out data selection method.
For experiment 2 (ABCD-E), 99.33% accuracy rate was obtained with the hold-out data selection method. This result is
0.27% less than the result in this study of Orhan et al. [49.]
In other experiments, classification was performed with the accuracy rates higher than the rates in this study of Orhan et al.
[49].
For experiment 3 (ACD-E), 98.37% accuracy rate was obtained with tenfold cross validation. Kumar et al. 51] who
used Fuzzy ApEn and SVM methods reported the closest value
(98.15%) to this result.

For experiment 4 (AB-CD-E), 98.28% accuracy rate was obtained with tenfold cross validation. Tzallas et al. [14] who used
time–frequency analysis and artificial neural network methods
reported the closest value (97.72%) to this result.
This experiment shows that the proposed method can be applied successfully to more complex problems.
All the methods and stages that were applied in the article
are presented in detail. This may give the idea that a complex
and computation burden method is applied. However, there is no
substantial difference between the method used and the methods given in Table V and Table VI in terms of simplicity and
computational load. The proposed method is a two-stage one,
such as the studies presented in Tables V and VI. These phases
are feature extraction and classification phase.
It is used in order to determine the parameter values in the
initial stage. The difference from the other studies in terms of the
proposed method is the use of complex numbers instead of real
values. Complex numbers do not impose a mathematical burden.
As presented in the last paragraph of Section II, it is known that
complex numbers play an important role in the fundamentals
of signal processing. Therefore, the use of complex numbers
provides a more natural way of achieving a solution with regard
to signal processing. When computing time is analyzed, it is

PEKER et al.: NOVEL METHOD FOR AUTOMATED DIAGNOSIS OF EPILEPSY USING COMPLEX-VALUED CLASSIFIERS

observed that the complex-valued classifier classifies faster than
the real-valued classifier. As a result, the method applied is a
fast one with a low calculation load.
VI. CONCLUSION
This study proposes a hybrid model for neurologists to help
them analyze EEG signals for epilepsy diagnostic purposes with
high rates of accuracy.
These models can be used in the automatic diagnosis of
epileptic activities from EEG signals. The prominent parts of
this study are as follows:
1) The effect of complex-valued classifiers shown to have a
positive impact on classification accuracy of EEG signal
data. It is projected that such high levels of prediction
accuracy rates can also be obtained in different biomedical
signal processing fields.
2) This study investigates the effects of different levels of
complex-valued wavelet transformation, the results, and
comparative analyses of findings for those different levels
are presented using popular statistical analysis metrics.
3) The reported measures include the required time for obtaining the experimental results. In our future studies, we
would like to minimize this duration by realizing the system using graphic processors. This will be possible by
utilizing a new technology in the form of CUDA programming. Also future studies will make use of a visual
interface for the model for ease of model building and. The
use of such a visual interactive interface would increase
the model’s intuitiveness applicability.
4) In order to determine the success of the method used, the
preferred datasets in previous studies were used. For future
studies it is intended that this method will be implemented
on EEG data involving larger and more continuous data.
