Field Distribution during Deep Brain Stimulation
Mattias Åström, Elin Diczfalusy, Hubert Martens, and Karin Wårdell∗ , Member, IEEE

Abstract—Models and simulations are commonly used to study
deep brain stimulation (DBS). Simulated stimulation fields are often defined and visualized by electric field isolevels or volumes of
tissue activated (VTA). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between stimulation field strength as defined
by the electric potential V, the electric field E, and the divergence
of the electric field ∇2 V , and neural activation. Axon cable models were developed and coupled to finite-element DBS models in
three-dimensional (3-D). Field thresholds (VT , ET , and ∇2 VT )
were derived at the location of activation for various stimulation
amplitudes (1 to 5 V), pulse widths (30 to 120 μs), and axon diameters (2.0 to 7.5 μm). Results showed that thresholds for VT
and ∇2 VT were highly dependent on the stimulation amplitude
while ET were approximately independent of the amplitude for
large axons. The activation field strength thresholds presented in
this study may be used in future studies to approximate the VTA
during model-based investigations of DBS without the need of computational axon models.
Index Terms—Axon cable model, deep brain stimulation (DBS),

I. INTRODUCTION
EEP brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for
movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, essential
tremor, and dystonia [1], [2]. DBS leads are implanted with
stereotactic neurosurgical techniques in the deep regions of the
brain [3]. Chronic electrical stimulation is delivered to the leads
from battery-operated pulse generators that are implanted below
the clavicle. The clinical benefit of DBS is largely dependent
on the spatial distribution of the stimulation field in relation to
brain anatomy [4]–[8].
To maximize therapeutic benefits while avoiding unwanted
side effects, precise control over the stimulation field is essential.
Finite-element models and simulations of DBS are commonly
used to calculate and display the distribution of the stimulation
field. Stimulation fields may be represented and visualized by

different electrical quantities such as the electric potential [6],
[9], [10], the electric field [11]–[13], the second difference of the
electric potential [4], [14], [15], as well as with a volume of tissue
activated (VTA) derived from neuron models coupled to finiteelement simulations [6], [8], [16], [17]. During modeling and
simulation of DBS a challenge is to display a stimulation field
that is relevant to the stimulation-induced therapeutic effects as
well as side effects. In order to visualize an electric entity that is
relevant for the therapeutic outcome of DBS it should ideally be
related to what is responsible for the clinical effects. However,
the mechanisms of DBS are not fully known. It is hypothesized
that jamming of the pathological activity is likely to play a
prominent role [18]. It is further hypothesized that activation of
axons may to a large part be responsible for the jamming but
also for inducing stimulation-induced side effects [19].
Activation of axons during extracellular stimulation is, however, rather complex. First of all, the threshold for activation is
widely ranging for different sizes of axons [20], and it is not
known what sizes of axons are responsible for therapeutic effects and side effects during DBS. In addition, polarization at
a particular axon node (voltage-sensitive ion channel) is dependent on the potential differences at the adjacent nodes on either
side of the particular node [21]. Thus, it is not possible to derive
the amount of polarization at a specific node without considering the field distribution in the vicinity of that location, i.e., the
curvature of the stimulation field. In addition, as presented in
Weiss’ equation [22], the width of the stimulation pulse affects
the polarization of neurons in a nonlinear fashion.
Activation of neurons of a specific type, size and orientation in relation to the stimulation field may be investigated by
the coupling of neuron compartment models to finite-element
simulations [4], [14], [17], [23], [24]. Simulations with coupled
neuron models are, however, limited by their complexity, and
the extensive execution time, as well as the obvious reason that
it is not known what neurons are responsible for certain effects
and side effects. The complexity of implementing and solving
axon models may be a major hurdle for many research groups
that would like to perform model-based investigations of DBS.
Computational time is also a major issue for software tools that
are to be used in clinical practice. In the present study we sought
to identify activation threshold levels related to the simulated
stimulation field that can be used to define the VTA. Specifically, the aim was to derive activation threshold levels for the
electric potential, the electric field, and the second derivative of
the electric potential (activating function, AF) and investigate
if these can be used to define the VTA during model-based investigations of DBS, without the need for computational axon
models.

II. METHOD
A. Axon Model
A computational axon cable model was developed to define
axonal activation in response to DBS stimulation. The electrophysiological response of the axon was modeled based on
ion channel kinetics and channel densities as described by Wesselink et al. [25] and Richardson et al. [26]. The general equation
describing the electrical response of the neuron is given by
dVm ,n 
+
cn
gx (Vm − vx ) − gA · Δ2 Vm ,n = gA · Δ2 Ve,n
dt
x
(1)
where the first term on the left-hand side describes the capacitive membrane current proportional to the total membrane
capacitance cn at each position n along the fiber over time; Vm ,n
corresponds to the membrane potential at position n. The second term represents the ionic membrane conductance at each
position; fast potassium, slow potassium, fast sodium, and leak
conductance at nodes of Ranvier and leak conductance at myelinated internodes. The dynamics of the ionic conductance at each
node of Ranvier were modeled according to experimental data
reported for human fibers [27]. The third term gives the axial
current flow, which is proportional to the axial conductance gA
between successive fiber segments and the second spatial difference of the membrane potential Δ2 Vm ,n . The right-hand part of
the equation describes the driving term due to the extracellular
electrical potential Ve ; this driving term is often referred to as
the AF. The AF is proportional to the discretized second spatial
derivative of Ve along the nodes of the axon, according to
Δ2 Ve (n) = Ve (n − 1) + Ve (n + 1) − 2Ve (n).

(2)

In addition, the internodal myelinated portion of the fibers
was explicitly modeled in order to match empirical data with
regards to conduction velocity and strength-duration. The fiber
geometry also plays an important part in the axon cable model,
since it strongly affects physiological properties such as the
action potential conduction velocity and the sensitivity to extra
cellular stimuli [21]. In the current model, the fiber geometry
was defined by its internodal length L (mm), the outer diameter
D (μm), the internodal axon inner diameter d (μm), and the nodal
axon diameter dn (μm) [see Fig. 1(a)]. The relation between L
and d was approximated by a power law according to

where

L = 146 d1.12

This relationship was derived from morphometric data of
mammalian central nervous system (CNS) fibers [28]–[31] and
is valid for D in the interval 1.5–10 μm.
Definitions of the nodal parameters used in the model are
presented in the Appendix, together with plots presenting the
relation between d, D, and L for the morphometric data used
for construction of the axon model. Ionic membrane conductances at nodes of Ranvier were modeled based on data by

Here, the axon models were located in a plane at the level of the active contact.

models were oriented perpendicular to the DBS lead in all cases.

Schwarz et al. [27] who studied human peripheral nerves (see the
Appendix). The leak conductance gL at nodes of Ranvier and
the fiber diameter D are the only parameters that were varied in
order to match the fiber model to available data for clinical DBS
data. All the other parameters were obtained from experimental
literature. In order to optimize gL , computed chronaxies were
matched to strength-duration data for stimulation in ventral intermedius nucleus of thalamus and the internal segment of the
globus pallidus (GPi) [32], [33]. Relevant fiber–diameter range
for clinical DBS was estimated by matching simulation results
to threshold–distance data for thalamic DBS [34].
Axon cable models with 21 nodes were constructed for a
range of different axon diameters (2.0–7.5 μm) corresponding to a range in intermodal length of 0.182–0.994 mm [31],
[35]. The axon models were implemented in MATLAB (The
MathWorks, USA), and the solver “ode15” was used to integrate the differential equations describing each axon cable
model.
B. DBS Model
A model of the DBS lead as well as surrounding tissue was
set up and used for simulation of the stimulation field. The DBS
lead was modeled with a diameter of 1.27 mm, four electrode
contacts with a height of 1.5 mm separated by 0.5 mm in order
to mimic Medtronic lead model 3389 (Medtronic Inc., USA).
The surrounding tissue was modeled as a sphere with a radius
of 30 cm placed as the outer boundary from the active electrode
contact. Homogeneous brain tissue was assumed for the sphere
and the layer of distributed resistance, and was modeled with a
conductivity σ = 0.1 S/m. Simulations were carried out during
single contact monopolar settings where contact 1 was active
and the outer boundary of the tissue was set to ground. Non
active contacts were set to floating [36]. The total impedance of
the model during single contact monopolar settings was 1 kΩ.
Simulations were carried out with COMSOL Multiphysics 4.4
(COMSOL AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and consisted of approximately 500 000 tetrahedral mesh elements. The mesh density

666

was defined by the built in physics-controlled mesh generator,
where the smallest elements were located by the electrode contacts in order to capture the strong electric field gradients by the
edges. The distribution of the electric potential Ve in the tissue
was simulated for various DBS amplitudes (VDBS ) by solving
the Laplace equation for steady currents [37]
∇ · J = −∇ · [σ∇Ve ] = 0.

(5)

For each amplitude, the distribution of the electric potential
was sampled in a region of interest and exported to MATLAB.
The sampled region of interest was defined as a plane at the
level of the active contact, perpendicular to the lead (XY-plane)
with a radial extension of 0 to 7 mm in X, and –20 to 20 mm
in Y.
C. Simulations
By combining the constructed axon cable models, the exported field distributions, and a function that defined the stimulation waveform over one stimulation cycle, the axonal responses
to extracellular stimulation were computed. The function defining the stimulation waveform was based on output from the
Medtronics Itrel II device [38] and consisted of a cathodic-first
biphasic charge-balanced waveform with a 0.4 ms interphase
gap. The width of the cathodic pulse was related to the pulse
width, while the anodic counterpulse width was set to 10 times
that of the cathodic pulse with an amplitude 0.1 times the cathodic pulse amplitude. The cathodic pulse amplitude was defined as the cathodic-peak to anodic-peak voltage of the DBS
waveform.
Axon models were positioned perpendicular to the lead within
the sampled region of interest at a radial distance of 0.7–7 mm,
in steps of 0.1 mm from the center of the DBS lead [see Fig. 1(b)
and (c)]. For each stimulation configuration, the maximum radial distance for which the axon was activated was stored. At this
location of activation the field strength was measured. The field
strength was measured in three different entities: the electric
potential (VT ); the magnitude of the gradient of the electric potential (∇VT ), commonly referred to as the electric field strength
(ET ); and the divergence of the electric field (∇2 VT ), which is
a generalization of the second derivative of the electric potential
in three dimensions. In total, 288 simulations were carried out
for the fiber diameters D (2.0 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, and
7.5 μm), pulse widths T (30, 60, 90, and 120 μs), and stimulation amplitudes VDBS (1.0–5.0 V; in steps of 0.5 V). In order
to further investigate the relationship between axonal activation
and VT , ET , and ∇2 VT additional simulations were carried out
for axon diameters of 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 μm, during stimulation
with VDBS of 3 V, and a pulse width set to 60 μs. Axons were
then located in the vicinity of the DBS lead similar to the previously explain simulation set up, but in multiple planes separated
by 0.1 mm to cover the full field along the lead [see Fig. 1(d)].
The result was visualized with stimulation fields for each entity
(VT , ET , and ∇2 VT ) as derived at the level of the active contact,
together with red markers at the locations where the axons were
activated.

D. Data Analysis
Activation field thresholds (VT , ET , and ∇2 VT ) at the location of activation were derived for all stimulation configurations. Median field thresholds (median) and range (min-max)
were calculated for each axon diameter and pulse width. In order to compare the activation field thresholds for each entity
(VT , ET , and ∇2 VT ), they were normalized with the activation
field strength derived during the lowest stimulation amplitude
setting, i.e., VDBS = 1.0 V.
E. Comparison With Other Models
In order to relate our results to existing DBS models, our
results were compared with voltage–distance data from a widely
used axon model developed by McIntyre et al. [4], [39]. Their
voltage–distance data were derived during stimulation with a
T = 100 μs and D = 5.7 μm. The axon diameter of our model
was adjusted in order to align with their results.
In addition, our derived activation threshold levels were compared with two previous studies were neural activation during
DBS was investigated [34], [40]. In the study by Kuncel et al.
[34], the spatial extent of activation in thalamic DBS during
stimulation with a T = 90 μs was investigated. When compared
with our results their derived relationship was implemented as

U − Uoﬀset
(6)
r(U) =
k
where Uoﬀset = 0.1 and k = 0.22.
In addition, comparisons were carried out with the results of
Madler and Coenen [40] who presented a function that describes
the radius of the volume of activated tissue during stimulation
with T = 60 μs in the subthalamic nucleus target area

k4 Ω − k42 Ω2 + 2k1 k4 Ω + k12 + 4k3 U + k1
r(Ω, U ) = −
2k3
(7)
where r is the radius of the VTA, Ω the tissue impedance, U
the stimulation amplitude in volt, and k1 , k3 , and k4 the derived
constants. When compared to our results the following constants
were applied
k1 = −1.0473, k3 = 0.2786, k4 = 0.0009856, and Ω = 1000.
III. RESULTS
A. Activation Field Thresholds
Activation field thresholds were derived for VT , ET , and
∇2 VT for all simulated axon diameters, pulse widths, and VDBS
settings. The activation field thresholds were normalized for
comparison between the different entities. Normalized results
for the axon diameters 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 μm and the different
pulse widths are presented in Figs. 2–4. Activation field thresholds for the electric potential VT increased substantially along
with an increased VDBS . The influence of the amplitude was
most pronounced for the smallest fiber diameter and shortest
pulse width (see Fig. 2). Activation field thresholds for the electric field ET increased with increased amplitude for the smallest
fiber diameter but remained approximately constant for larger

fibers (D = 5 μm and 7.5 μm) (see Figs. 3 and 4). Activation
field thresholds for ∇2 VT decreased with increased stimulation
amplitude for all fiber diameters and pulse widths. Median and
range of the normalized activation field thresholds for VT , ET ,
and ∇2 VT during stimulation with T = 60 μs are presented in
Table I. For large axons (5.0 and 7.5 μm) the median of ET was
close to 1 with a relatively small range (1.00–1.19) and (0.97–
1.06) respectively, while VT and ∇2 VT showed larger ranges.
Absolute activation field thresholds for VT , ET , and ∇2 VT are
presented in Table II.
As expected, it was found that the activation field thresholds
for all electrical entities were lower for larger fiber diameters and
for longer pulse widths. In order to cover the range of clinically

was performed with activation field thresholds for the lowest V D B S value, i.e., 1 V.

relevant axon diameters in DBS targets, additional simulations
were carried out for axons in the range 2.0–5.0 μm in steps of
0.5 μm (see Table III).
Comparisons between VT , ET , and ∇2 VT and axonal activation were also carried out at different depths along the lead for
axon diameters of 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 μm. The results was visualized with stimulation field isolevels for each entity (VT , ET , and
∇2 VT ) at thresholds derived at the level of the active contact.
Red markers display the locations where action potentials was
initiated (see Fig. 5). It was found that all the electrical entities
roughly fitted the volume of axonal activation, although none of
the electrical entities aligned perfectly with the VTA.

Simulations were carried out for amplitudes of 1–5 V in steps of 0.5 V (n = 9).

T of 60 μs, and axon diameters D of 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5μm. The red markers
represent the location where the axon cable models were activated.

IV. DISCUSSION
Finite-element DBS models were coupled to a novel axon
model in order to investigate the relationship between neural
activation and the stimulation field strength at the location of activation. The results showed that the VTA can be approximated
by a constant stimulation field threshold (VT , ET , or ∇2 VT )
presented in this study without the need to couple axon models to the finite-element solution. The simulations were carried
out for clinically relevant amplitudes and pulse widths typically
used for treatment of Parkinson’s disease [1].
A. Activation Field Thresholds

B. Comparison With Other Models
The results from our axon model were compared with
voltage–distance data from McIntyre’s axon model [see
Fig. 6(a)]. In order to align the results a pulse width of 100 μs and
an axon diameter of 3.5 μm were used for our axon model, contrary to what was used in McIntyre’s study 5.7 μm and 100 μs.
The difference in axon diameter was to a large part related to
how the two models calculated the diameter-based internodal
length. After this adjustment, both models showed similar results. In Fig. 6(b), two activation field thresholds for the electric
field (0.165 and 0.190 V/mm) were used for comparison with
the results of Kuncel et al. and Madler and Coenen. The electric
field matched well with both studies.

Activation threshold levels for the electric potential, the electric field, and the divergence of the electric field, were derived
at the location of activation during one contact monopolar stimulation. Simulations showed that the derived field thresholds
were dependent upon stimulation amplitude, pulse width, and
axon diameter. The electric field ET showed the least sensitivity
to stimulation amplitude and were approximately independent
of the amplitude for large axons (see Figs. 2–4 and Table I).
This suggests that the VTA for large axons can be approximated by a constant electric field threshold independent of the
stimulation amplitude, while for smaller axons the stimulation
amplitude should be considered when using the electric field
as an approximation of the VTA. The electric potential field
thresholds VT increased substantially with increased stimulation

of 3 μm [24]. In order to cover this range of axon diameters,
additional simulations were also carried out and electric field
thresholds were derived and presented in Table III.
B. Visualization

of McIntyre et al. [4]. In order to align the results, a diameter of 3.5 μm was
used for our axon cable model. (b) Comparison between electric field strength

amplitude and showed a nonlinear appearance. This has also
been shown by Chaturvedi et al. [10]. The activation thresholds
for the divergence of the electric field ∇2 VT decreased with
increased stimulation amplitude. Similarly, McIntyre et al. [4],
[14] showed a nonlinear decrease of the activation field strength
by increased distance to axon for the second derivate of the
electric potential.
Since the mechanisms of DBS are not well understood, it
is not know which neurons are primarily responsible for the
therapeutic effects and side effects. It is likely that certain side
effects are related to stimulation of large axons such as capsular fibers, while other effects may be related to stimulation of
smaller axons when nuclei are targeted such as the STN or the
GPi. Measurements of axon diameters inside the STN and GPi
have shown axon diameters ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 μm [41].
In a model-based study axons in the STN were modeled with a
diameter of 2 μm, while axons in the fields of Forel H2, substantial nigra, and zona incerta were modeled with a diameter

Several previous studies have used an electric field isolevel of
0.2 V/mm for defining the stimulation field [12], [13], [42]. In
our study, this isolevel corresponds to a fiber diameter between
3 and 3.5 μm for a pulse width of 60 μs (see Table III). When
comparing the simulations with the results of Kuncel et al. and
Madler and Coenen, the 0.165 and 0.190 V/mm isolevels [see
Fig. 6(b)] would correspond to axon diameters between 3 and
4 μm. Multiple electric field isolevels have also been used to define and display the stimulation field [43], [44]. Such multilevel
presentations might be useful in order to visualize tentative activation of different axons. Independent of the threshold chosen
for visualization, the electric field has the advantage of making relative comparisons possible between patients and studies,
since the results are not limited to a specific axon model.
C. Axon Model
As the axon geometry and in particular the internodal length
L has a substantial impact on the activation threshold, efforts
were put to model L based on detailed morphometric data previously reported in the literature [28]–[31]. From this data, a
power law [see (3)] was derived to calculate L based on D. Resulting internodal lengths deviate slightly from the commonly
approximated relationship of 100:1 [21]. The fit of the power
law to the morphometric data is shown in the Appendix (see
Fig. 7).
Our axon model is valid for smaller fiber diameters (range
1.5–10 μm, see the Appendix) than what is commonly used
during model-based studies on DBS. This fiber diameter range
should be compared to the neuron model presented by McIntyre et al. [39], which is valid for D in the interval 5.7–16 μm
and commonly used in the model-based DBS community [14],
[17], [23], [24]. When comparing our axon model with this
axon model, it was clear that there was a difference with regard to axon diameters and corresponding internodal lengths
[see Fig. 6(a)]. In McIntyre’s model, a D of 5.7 μm corresponds
to an L of 0.5 mm, while in our model, the same axon diameter corresponds to an L of 0.726 mm. Due to the substantial

670

impact of the internodal length on the activation threshold, it
may be considered in the future to define modeled axons by
their internodal length instead of their axon diameter.
D. DBS Model
Model-based studies are in general full of assumptions and
simplifications [45], [46]. Thus, model-based investigations
should always be considered on a rough level. Nevertheless,
models and simulations can be valuable for providing knowledge on a general level, or when relative differences are studied.
In the present study, homogeneous tissue was used in order
to produce general results. Thus, no heterogeneity such as encapsulation tissue, tissue inhomogeneities, or anisotropic tissue
properties was implemented although such properties will influence the results in the patient-specific case.
One contact cathodic monopolar stimulation settings was
used together with a model of Medtronic lead model 3389.
Thus, the results of this study are only valid for this case and
it is not evident that the results can be generalized for other
configurations and DBS leads. The underlying reason is that
activation of axons is dependent upon the curvature of the stimulation field, and different configurations and DBS leads may
generate fields with different field curvatures.
The curvature of the stimulation field may also be affected
by the location of the grounded reference electrode as shown by
Walckiers et al. [47] and the inclusion of a whole-head model
[48]. Field thresholds for the electric field ET showed the smallest influence of field curvatures with only a threshold range of
9% for the largest axon diameter (7.5 μm) during stimulation
with 1–5 V (see Table I). In order to minimize the influence of
the curvature of the stimulation field, the electric field thresholds ET may be preferred when approximating the VTA with
a constant stimulation field threshold. Future studies may investigate how these activation thresholds are related to other
modes of stimulation, such as double monopolar, bipolar, and
tripolar stimulation, or stimulation with other DBS leads. In addition, patient-specific tissue models with axons positioned in
a patient-specific manner in the vicinity of the DBS lead have
been used extensively in the past [7], [14], [17], [23]. Similar
studies could be carried out to investigate the impact of tissue
heterogeneity [13] and anisotropy [44] on the stimulation field
thresholds.
V. CONCLUSION
A neuron model valid for small axon diameters has been introduced and used together with finite-element models of DBS for
calculation of activation field thresholds. Results showed that the
electric potential, the electric field as well as the second derivative of the electric potential can be used to approximate the VTA
without the need to couple axon models to the finite-element
solution. Electric field thresholds showed the least sensitivity
to stimulation amplitude and were approximately independent
of the amplitude for large axons. The activation field strength
thresholds presented in this study may be used in future studies
to approximately define the VTA during model-based investigations of DBS.
