Epileptic Seizure Classification of EEG Time-Series
Using Rational Discrete Short-Time
Fourier Transform
Kaveh Samiee∗, Péter Kovács, and Moncef Gabbouj, Fellow, IEEE

Abstract—A system for epileptic seizure detection in electroencephalography (EEG) is described in this paper. One of the challenges is to distinguish rhythmic discharges from nonstationary
patterns occurring during seizures. The proposed approach is
based on an adaptive and localized time–frequency representation
of EEG signals by means of rational functions. The corresponding
rational discrete short-time Fourier transform (DSTFT) is a novel
feature extraction technique for epileptic EEG data. A multilayer
perceptron classifier is fed by the coefficients of the rational DSTFT
in order to separate seizure epochs from seizure-free epochs. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is compared with several
state-of-art feature extraction algorithms used in offline epileptic
seizure detection. The results of the comparative evaluations show
that the proposed method outperforms competing techniques in
terms of classification accuracy. In addition, it provides a compact
representation of EEG time-series.

I. INTRODUCTION
LECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG) is one of the
most common techniques used for monitoring the brain
activities. Generally, expert neurologists analyze the records
visually, which is time consuming. In particular, the noisy characteristics of the EEG recording make it difficult to separate
seizures from artifacts with similar time–frequency patterns. To
address this problem, machine learning algorithms have been
widely used for automatic detection or prediction of epileptic
seizures in raw EEG signals. Generally, preprocessing and feature extraction steps are performed, followed by (un)supervised
data mining methods. Lately, a wide range of general signal
processing and machine learning algorithms were adapted for
seizure detection and EEG classification. Then, the most important step is to extract discriminative features in the time
and/or frequency domains. Preprocessing of the raw EEG data

is commonly used to remove major artifacts caused by muscle
activities or eye blinking.
For instance Polat and Güneş [1], [2] used the fast Fourier
transform (FFT)-based feature extraction to detect rhythmic discharges in epileptic seizures, while Gabor et al. [3], [4] used FFT
to calculate the spectrograms in the frequency band 0 to 32 Hz
for each EEG channel. Namely, a 2-D FFT spectrogram of size
8 × 32 was computed for eight EEG channels. A self-organizing
map was then used for the classification [5]. However, wavelet
transforms are more appropriate for analyzing nonstationary
EEG signals since they provide a simultaneous representation
in the time–frequency domain. For instance, Adeli et al. [6], [7]
applied Daubechies wavelet transform to analyze the epileptic
seizure pattern in five frequency subbands: delta (0–4 Hz), theta
(4–7 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz), and gamma (30-60
Hz). Using these five subbands and the chaos theory, nonlinear
dynamics of the EEG are simultaneously quantified by a classifier. Then, the correlation dimension (CD) is used to represent
the complexity of the system, and the chaoticity is measured
by the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) in the five subbands.
Finally, each EEG signal is classified into three classes: healthy,
interictal, and ictal. It is also worth mentioning that the special
short-time Fourier transform (STFT), namely the Gabor transform, has been found effective in epileptic seizure analysis. Chen
et al. [8] described the EEG signal patterns during epilepsy periods by means of the so-called frequency band relative intensity
ratio. In this method, a filter bank consisting of a number of
Gabor filters, with different parameters such as orientations and
central frequencies, was used to detect seizure and seizure-free
epochs. The advantage of this method is that it works simultaneously on both scalp EEG and electrocardiography (ECG) and
so improves information extraction [9].
The proposed method relies on rational functions (RFs),
which were efficiently used to represent one period of an ECG
in [10] and [11]. Furthermore, these systems were successfully
applied for modeling the QRS complex [12] and for compressing the heart beats as well. We note that the basic concept of
this method was originally proposed in [13]. In this paper, we
extend the previous work by providing a detailed description
of the time–frequency model, adding feature analysis and more
comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we
use results from the recently developed theory of signal models
based on rational orthogonal polynomials (see, e.g., [10]–[12])
to construct an efficient epileptic seizure classification algorithm utilizing such functions. Namely, we introduce a novel
time–frequency representation, which can be interpreted as a

generalization of the classical STFT. Furthermore, we compare
the accuracy of both methods by means of the reconstruction
error and the classification performance. The main advantages of
the proposed feature extraction algorithm are that it is adaptive,
scalable, and the model is compact in both time and frequency
domains. Moreover, we show that our method outperforms conventional time–frequency feature extraction techniques commonly used in epilepsy research in terms of robustness and
efficiency. The experiments are available and completely reproducible by using the MATLAB implementation in [14].
This paper is organized as follows. Section II contains the relevant part of the theory of RF systems. Section III presents the
method for time–frequency representation. Additionally, Section IV provides a novel feature extraction technique for EEG
signals. Section V presents the experiments on the recordings
of the Bonn EEG database [15], while Section VI discusses
the results and the comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.
Finally, Section VII concludes this paper.
II. RFS
In this section, we give a brief introduction of the theory
of RFs. Let C represent the set of complex numbers, D :=
{ z ∈ C : |z| < 1 } the open unit disk, N := { 1, 2, 3, . . . } the
set of natural numbers, and T := { z ∈ C : |z| = 1 } the unit
circle (or torus).
The basic RF are defined as follows:
ra,k (z) =

1
,
(1 − az)k

f=

ck ra,k ,

(a ∈ D)

z−a
(z ∈ C \ { 1/a }) .
1 − az
Although we have an orthogonal set of functions the time localization property of the basic rational form has been lost. Fortunately, biorthogonal rational functions (BRF) cure this problem by keeping the orthogonality while avoiding the drawbacks
of the MT system. This type of biorthogonal systems can be
defined by taking n + 1 different poles a0 , . . . , an with multiplicities m0 , . . . , mn and the corresponding modified rational
base functions (MRF)
Ba (z) :=

ϕk ,i (z) =

z i−1
(1 − ak z)i

(k = 0, . . . , n, i = 1, . . . , mk ) .

We note that, the system of ra,k and ϕa,k span the same subspaces of R for a = 0. For the definition of a biorthogonal
system, the following functions are needed:

(a ∈ D, k ∈ N) .

Parameter a is referred to as the inverse pole (because 1/a is
a pole in the standard sense), k is said to be the order of the
basic function. Using a terminology similar to the trigonometric
case, the value k = 1 corresponds to the fundamental tone and
k > 1 the overtones. Let us denote the proper RFs that are
analytic on the closed unit disk by R. Then, it can be shown that
R = span {ra,k : k ∈ N, a ∈ D} , i.e., any function f ∈ R can
be written as

with 0 ≤ k ≤ n , where Ba (z) is the so-called Blaschke function defined by

for an appropriate set of complex coefficients ck ∈ C .
However, the basic RFs {ra,k : k ∈ N, a ∈ D} are linearly
independent, but do not form an orthogonal set, so it is difficult
to compute the ck coefficients in (1). On the other hand, we can
easily solve this problem by applying Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization to the basic RFs. The corresponding RF system is the
so-called Malmquist–Takenaka (MT) system. A handy property
of the MT system is that the elements can be explicitly expressed
as Blaschke products. Namely, taking the basic functions for a
given n ∈ N and the sequence of poles a0 , . . . , an ∈ D the orthogonalized MT system can be written as

SAMIEE et al.: EPILEPTIC SEIZURE CLASSIFICATION OF EEG TIME-SERIES USING RATIONAL DSTFT

In this paper, we take the restriction of the functions f ∈
H 2 (D) on the unit circle by applying the mapping t → eit , t ∈
[−π, π). Besides, we consider the discrete-time signals as functions f ∈ H 2 (T ), which are uniformly sampled at the unit circle. Then, the scalar product can be approximated by replacing
the integral with a sum in (2).
The advantages of the use of RF systems over the other transformation methods are as follows:
1) flexibility in the sense that not only the coefficients but
also the system itself can be varied, which means the
system can be adapted to the EEG signal;
2) the coefficients give a compressed representation of the
signal, so in further processing steps they can be used as
features;
3) the elementary waves are localized in time and the basic
functions can carry time–frequency information;
4) this is a simple analytic representation of the original
signal, which means the whole set of analytic tools can be
applied on the representation;
5) only a couple of arithmetic operations are required to
recover the signal.
We note that the MT and the biorthogonal systems Φ and Ψ
with the basic RFs ϕ are referred as the rational orthogonal basis
(ROB) in the literature. The construction of these generalized
orthogonal bases were introduced by Heuberger et al. [17].
III. GENERALIZED STFT
Fourier transform is a well-known tool for analyzing the frequency distribution of a signal. Unfortunately, the time information is lost after this transformation. As a consequence, sudden
changes of the signal cannot be localized in time. However, there
is a wide range of applications where both time and frequency
information are needed. On the other hand, several techniques
such as STFT, Wigner–Ville transform (WVT), Choi–Williams
distribution, etc., are attempted to solve this problem. Most of
these algorithms operate on short segments of the signal, which
make it possible to localize the frequencies in time. On the
other hand, there is a large tradeoff between the resolutions in
the two domains (time and frequency). That is any attempt to
increase the time resolution causes a decrease in the frequency
resolution, and vice versa. The well-known continuous wavelet
transform (CWT) provides a good solution for this problem. In
the case of CWT, the frequency domain is logarithmically scaled
by dynamically changing the window size. For this reason, the
lower frequencies have a fine frequency distribution, while the
higher ones are well localized in time. Generally, the orthogonal wavelet basis is not an adaptive system. Hence, the required
number of coefficients can be high for achieving an acceptable
level of accuracy.
Let us consider a signal f ∈ L2 (R) and define its STFT in
the form

Fg f (t, ω) =
f (τ − t)g(τ )e−2π iτ ω dτ (t, ω ∈ R) (4)
R

where g is the complex conjugate of g ∈ L2 (R). In practical applications, the so-called window function g is compactly

543

supported. In this case, the integral in (4) can be computed over
the support of g. Furthermore, this algorithm can be interpreted
as a successive evaluation of Fourier transforms over short segments of the whole signal. Additionally, the frequencies can be
visually represented by displaying the squared magnitude of the
Fourier coefficients at each segment. The resulting diagram is
called the spectrogram of signal f.
Let us denote the uniformly sampled f (t) and g(t) functions
by f [n] and g[n], respectively. The discrete (D) STFT over the
compactly supported g window function can be written as
Fg f [n, k] =

M
−1


f [m − n]g[m]k [m]

(n, k ∈ N)

(5)

m =0

where k [m] = e−2π k M (0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1) and M is the window length. Perfect reconstruction is possible if we choose
N ≥ M , which is the number of equally spaced frequency bins
(see, e.g., [18, ch. 5]).
Using the same terminology as in (5), we can define a similar
representation of the signal by replacing the trigonometric bases
k with the elements of the ROB. More precisely, let us consider
n + 1 different poles a0 , . . . , an with multiplicities m0 , . . . , mn
and the uniformly sampled functions f, g ∈ H 2 (T ). In order to
define a generalized time–frequency representation, we set N
to be equal to the sum of the multiplicities and M to be a proper
window size. Then, the rational DSTFT can be written as

with 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1, where φk [m] = Φk (e−2π M ), but

ψk [m] = Ψ0,k +1 (e−2π M ) or ϕk [m] = ϕ0,k +1 (e−2π M ) can

where 0 ≤ m ≤ M − 1. These formulas follow from the discretization of (2) and (3) as a consequence of the orthogonal and
biorthogonal properties of the RF systems Φk , Ψl,k , and ϕi,j .
This procedure can also be interpreted as a windowed Fourier
transform, but now we are using a different basis. In addition, if
we set ak = 0 for all k, then ϕk [m] = φk [m] = k [m], so we get
back the classical DSTFT as a special case, which can be seen
inFigs. 2 and 3. We note that the ≈ token was used in (7). The
main reason for this is that there are no proper inversion formulas
for these types of rational systems at the uniform discretization
of the unit disk. On the other hand, perfect reconstruction is also
possible if we resample the original signal f over an appropriate nonuniform discrete grid. For further details, the reader is
referred to [16, proof of Th. 2].

Let us set the number of poles and their multiplicities such

This can be interpreted as Parsevals formula of the generalized
transformation. Hence, we have the same energy preservation
property as in the case of the classical DSTFT.
Now, the generalized rational DSTFT and its inverse can be
easily computed for f ∈ H 2 (T ) using (6) and (7). Unfortunately, in most cases, the real signals f ∈ L2 (T ) have nonzero
negative Fourier coefficients, so they cannot be interpreted as
the elements of H 2 (T ). Nevertheless, we can handle this issue by using the analytic representation of real signals. Namely,
we should compute the function F = f + iHf , where H denotes the well-known Hilbert transformation. For instance, the
hilbert operator can evaluate F in MATLAB, and then,
the generalized rational DSTFT can be applied on the result.
Moreover, the coefficients and the expansions in (3) can be
easily calculated by using the biort_coeffs and
mt_coeffs commands of the RAIT MATLAB toolbox [21].

where t ∈ [0, π] and g is the so-called Hanning window. In our
first experiment, we apply the rational DSTFT transformation to
f , which was uniformly sampled with the sampling frequency
fs = 4000 Hz. One can see the functions f and f3 in Fig. 1.
Additionally, we use only one pole a0 with multiplicity N =
m0 = 32 by setting the window length M = 128. Hence, we
compute 32 frequency components at each windowed segment.
For the sake of simplicity, we use the uniform distribution on
the real interval [−1, 0] as the poles of the biorthogonal RF
system. Then, the absolute square values of the Rψ F g f [n, k]
coefficients are displayed in Figs. 2 and 3. We note that for a0 =
0 we get back the classical DSTFT where the two frequency
components f1 and f2 are well separated.
IV. FEATURE EXTRACTION USING RATIONAL DSTFT
A. Dataset
In this study, we use an EEG database, which has been provided by the University of Bonn and is freely available online
[15]. This database has been widely used for EEG feature extraction and classification in the literature [22]. The EEG database
consists of five sets (A–E). Each set contains 100 single-channel
EEG segments, each with a duration of 23.6 s. Sets A and B have
been recorded using the standard international 10–20 system
for surface EEG recording. Five healthy volunteers were participated in these tests with eyes open (A) and eyes closed (B).
For sets C, D, and E, five epileptic patients were selected for
presurgical evaluation of epilepsy by using intracranial electrodes. Depth electrodes were implanted symmetrically to

record EEG from the epileptogenic zone (D) and from hippocampal formation of the opposite hemisphere of the brain
(C). Segments of set E were taken from contacts of all electrodes. In sets C and D, segments contain interictal intervals
while seizure activities occur in set E. Each epoch was sampled
at 173.61 Hz resulting in a total of 4096 samples.
B. Rational DSTFT Coefficients
In this paper, we apply the generalized rational DSTFT to
EEG time series. The seizure epochs in set E contain lowfrequency oscillations in the theta frequency subband along with
high-frequency rhythmic spikes, and high amplitude changes in
the alpha and beta frequency subbands. These characteristics
of the seizure patterns can be used to distinguish them from
seizure-free EEG segments. Thus, we want to achieve a better
resolution by increasing the number of coefficients. In this paper, we use one pole a0 with m0 multiplicity. Then, we represent
each EEG epoch of length M by N = m0 coefficients of the
rational DSTFT. The optimal parameters a0 , M, and N will be
determined in Section V. As features, the absolute values of
the coefficients and the following five statistical measures are
considered:
1) absolute mean value;
2) absolute median value;
3) absolute standard deviation;
4) absolute maximum value;
5) absolute minimum value of the coefficients.
The resulting feature vector contains N + 5 feature elements
for each M sample long EEG epoch. For instance, in Fig. 4,
one can see the rational DSTFT spectra for all the five sets and
the comparison with the classical STFT spectra. Here, we used
the MT system Φk with 32 coefficients and a fixed window size
of 0.5 s (i.e., N = 32, and M = 88). The figure shows that the
frequency responses can be similar to each other as we move
the pole closer to zero.

V. CLASSIFICATION
In order to evaluate the efficiency and the robustness of the
proposed feature extraction method, we perform different binary classification tasks. We mainly investigate the detection of
epileptic seizure epochs (Set E) in the presence of seizure-free
epochs (Sets A, B, C, and D). Thus, we define six classification
tasks as
1) (E - A): classification of set E in the presence of set A;
2) (E - B): classification of set E in the presence of set B;
3) (E - C): classification of set E in the presence of set C;
4) (E - D): classification of set E in the presence of set D;
5) (E - A, C): classification of set E in the presence of sets A
and C;
6) (E - A, B, C, D): classification of set E in the presence of
sets A, B, C and D.
In all of these classification tasks the rational DSTFT features
were tested by using various classifiers such as naive Bayes,
logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest
neighbors and multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. After
a series of numerical experiments, the feed forward MLP has
been selected as the optimal classifier, which is trained by the
back-propagation algorithm. More precisely, the MLP architecture consists of N + 5 neurons in the input layer, (N + 6)/2
neurons in the hidden layer, and two neurons in the output layer
representing seizure and seizure-free classes.
A. Impact of the Pole on the Classification Accuracy
Once the poles and multiplicities are given, the orthogonal
and biorthogonal rational systems are determined. Then, the
coefficients of the representation can be easily calculated by using the discretization of the scalar product in (2). Although
the system is adaptive due to the free parameters provided
by the pole(s), it has an effect on the coefficients as well. Namely,
the shape of the base functions varies along with the position of
the pole a0 . For this reason, the classification results can also

change. One of the main interest of this section is to analyze the
impact of the position of the pole a0 on the classification accuracy. More precisely, we compare the classification results of
the simple (E - A) task for a set of poles, which are chosen from
a 50 × 50 grid of the unit circle. Half of the dataset is used to
train the classifier and the other half was used for testing. Additionally, for each 1-s long epoch M = 176, we extract N = 16
coefficients with respect to four different rational systems (MT,
RF, MRF, and BRF). Then, we apply MLP architecture as the
classifier, which was described in the previous section.
According to our experiments, the number of zero coefficients increases in the rational DSTFT as the absolute value of
the pole increases. This phenomenon is caused by the terms in
the rational series expansions in (6) as they represent higher
frequencies while the poles tend closer to the torus. These zero
coefficients can reduce the accuracy of the A-E classification
task up to 6%. However, for the poles that are close enough to
the center, the classification accuracy is similar to the rational
STFT, which is a special case of the proposed model for a0 = 0.
This can be seen in Fig. 5 where the classification results of the
four rational systems have been displayed at each pole. During
this experiment, we extracted different rational coefficients for
all EEG records while we used the same pole for every segment.
Then, the classification accuracy at each pole is indicated by a
color code. One can see that the results are similar near the
zero pole. Unfortunately, stepping away from zero can degrade
the results by introducing more zero coefficients to the rational expansion. All the RF systems defined in Section II share
the same behavior because they span the same subspaces of R
for a = 0. Table I shows the average and the highest classification accuracies for each rational system. As it can be seen, MT
representation can outperform all the other rational series expansions. Therefore, we will consider only MT rational systems

in our further experiments. Moreover, the proposed algorithm
can outperform the classical STFT technique as well by fixing
the pole at a0 = −0.1 + 0.1i. It means that the performance of
the classical STFT-based seizure detection methods can be improved by using RF systems. Furthermore, the results highlight
the importance of choosing the right pole as well.
For this reason, we decided not to fix the pole for the whole
signal. More precisely, an optimal pole was chosen by using
the well-known particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm
[23]–[25] to minimize the mean square error (MSE) of the reconstructed signal. Taking advantage of this adaptive behavior
of the RF systems, the projection error can be minimized. The
purpose of the optimization procedure is to make a compact
representation of each segment. Consequently, the coefficients
can carry more information and they can be used as features.
Flexibility is one of the main advantages of the rational DSTFT
comparing to other STFT representations. Namely, the rational
systems can be varied from segment to segment in contrast with
the uniform representations such as STFT, WVT, or even the
CWT where the shapes of the base functions are fixed for all
segments. For this reason, we expect an improvement in the
classification accuracies comparing to STFT-based features.
B. Impact of the Time–Frequency Resolution
The classification accuracy of EEG epochs mostly depends
on two primary regularizations of the time–frequency transform:
1) time resolution, which is equal to the size of each epoch M.
In real applications, it is generally more than 1 s; 2) frequency
resolution, which is related to the number of coefficients N
(i.e., features). Hence, in case of multichannel EEG data, highdimensional feature vectors should be avoided. For this reason,
we investigate the tradeoff between time and frequency resolutions to reduce the computational complexity.
In order to find the best choice for the epoch size and the
optimal number of coefficients, we consider all the possible
combinations for M = 173, 256, 512, 1024 samples long segments with N = 8, 16, 32 number of MT coefficients. We evaluated the average classification accuracy of the six classification
tasks for each combination. As it can be seen in Table II, the
best average classification accuracy using MT rational DSTFT is
obtained for 32 coefficients with 256 sample size window, which
is roughly equal to 1.5 s. Besides, the highest average sensitivity (true-positive-ratio) and specificity (true-negative-ratio) are

also obtained for this combination of epoch size and number of
coefficients. Moreover, by increasing the size of the epoch, the
performance of the MT rational DSTFT is dropped. This phenomenon is due to the fact that only a limited number of base
functions were used for the representation. In contrast, the classical STFT operates with an equal number of bases and samples
in the epoch. The former method is an approximation, while the
latter one is an interpolation procedure. For this reason, rational
DSTFT may not be able to fit the signal in the presence of a long
epoch and high frequency changes. Hence, we fix the window
size to M = 256 samples and we extract N = 32 coefficients
in our further experiments.
VI. RESULTS
In this section, we compare the performance of the MT rational DSTFT system with the classical STFT in terms of classification accuracy. Based on the results in Section V, we decided
to use the optimal pole at each segment by setting N = 32 and
M = 256. Furthermore, we applied the classical STFT, which
is embedded in MATLAB. For all of the six classification tasks
defined in Section V we consider 50% of the data, chosen randomly, as the training set and the remaining data as the test set.
More precisely, for the MT rational DSTFT, we extract feature
vectors containing 37 elements (32 coefficients + 5 statistical
values). For the classical STFT, we choose 32 coefficients with
the largest absolute values from each 256 sample long epoch.
Table III shows the classification results for the six classification
tasks. As it can be seen, MT rational DSTFT yields the highest classification accuracy. It means that the proposed method
is able to achieve a higher sensitivity while keeping the same
specificity of the classical STFT. Recall that, sets A and B,
and sets C, D, and E are recorded using scalp and intracra-

nial electrodes, respectively. However, this has no influence on
the performance of the proposed method as it can be seen in
Table III. Therefore, the classical STFT-based EEG feature
extraction algorithms can be improved by using the proposed rational t-f distribution. Although we achieved a small
amount of enhancement in the sense of classification accuracy, the reconstruction error has been significantly decreased
comparing to the classical STFT. Furthermore, the representation is more compact thanks to the adaptive nature of the RF
systems, which can be seen in Fig. 6. The inverse discrete (ID)

resolution, the lower it is for the time localization, and vice
versa (see, e.g., [26, ch. 1]).
Although several procedures have been constructed to cure
this problem, there is no clear winner among them. Unfortunately, all time–frequency (t-f) distributions suffer from this
problem to some extent. In the previous sections, we have already compared the proposed method with the classical STFT,
where a particular window g(t) had been used for time localization. Here, the length of the function g(t) controls the
tradeoff between the t-f resolutions. The WVT was another solution, which does not spread the time or frequency support of
sinusoids (see [26, Th. 4.7]). Although it gives a very good t-f
resolution, it can hardly be used in the case of multicomponent
signals because of the so-called cross terms. However, there is
a family of t-f representations, which may solve this problem.
The Cohens class of distributions [27] is a generalization of the
WVT, where most of the cross terms are eliminated using different kernels. The related power spectrum can be written in the
form

MSEs for the Bonn batabase.

STFT of the signal was computed by using the optimal parameters N = 32 and M = 256. Then, the average mean square
error was evaluated for all EEG records of the Bonn dataset.
The overall MSEs are as follows: 2.52 × 103 and 5.5 × 102 . In
this sense, the accuracy of the representation is about 4.5 times
better than STFT. As a consequence, the proposed representation is more robust than the classical STFT, i.e., one can achieve
a better classification result with our model using a smaller set
of coefficients or features. In other words, the proposed method
provides a sparse representation of the signal while the components remain orthogonal.
A. Time–Frequency Distributions
In quantum mechanics, the well-known Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the position and momentum of a
particle cannot be measured at the same time with arbitrarily
high precision. In signal processing, this theorem is referred to
as Gabor limit, which is related to the fact that a function and
its Fourier transform cannot have compact support at the same
time. As a consequence, the higher level is for the frequency

There is a wide range of applications of these distributions.
Additionally, a recent study [28] has already introduced a feature
synthesis for epileptic seizure detection in EEG based on these
t-f distributions. For the sake of completeness, we also tested
the proposed algorithm against 13 Cohen’s class distributions
with different kernels. In order to extract features from each t-f
representation, we follow the same procedure as suggested in
[28]. More precisely, a grid is constructed for each 1 s long EEG
epoch to divide its t-f plane into regions. Each region points out
a specific frequency subband in a certain time window. The
frequency subbands are: 0–2.5 Hz, 2.5–5.5 Hz, 5.5–10.5 Hz,
10.5–21.5 Hz, and 21.5–43.5 Hz. Moreover, we divide the time
axis into three equal windows resulting in a total 15 t-f regions.
Then, the energy of the signal is computed in each region to
extract feature vectors. Furthermore, the energy of the signal
over the entire segment is also computed as an additional feature
resulting in a feature vector with 16 elements. Finally, the feature
vectors are fed into the MLP classifier, which was trained in
the same way by using 50% of the data.
Table IV shows the results of the six classification tasks using different t-f distributions and the comparison with two sets
of MT rational DSTFT features, one with similar epoch size
and N = 16 coefficients and the other with the optimal setting (M = 256 samples and N = 32 coefficients) determined in
Section V-B. The classification results of the Cohen’s class t-f
distributions do not differ significantly from each other except
for the Pseudopage distribution. Furthermore, we could achieve
the best accuracy in all the binary classification tasks, and the

difference is more than 8.3% and 3.3% for last two classification tasks, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method shows
a significant improvement in terms of sensitivity and accuracy
for the first four classification tasks. We note that the database is
very small compared to long term recordings used in practical
applications [29]. Additionally, our algorithm uses only a few
coefficients of the rational decomposition in contrast to t-f features in [28], where the sums of several coefficients were used
from particular partitions of the power spectra.
Wavelet-based power spectra has been also developed to
maintain the tradeoff between the t-f domains. In this case, the
frequency distribution is scaled in a nonlinear way. Namely,
higher levels possess a fine time resolution, but poor frequency
resolutions. This has proved to be a very useful property in many
practical applications [30]. Although various types of wavelet
functions exist, the decomposition procedure itself generally
works with a fixed orthogonal basis. For this reason, the wavelet
packets were introduced by Coifman et al. [31] to form an
adaptive wavelet representation. In this case, one can define a
particular tiling of the t-f plane by selecting the optimal coefficients related to the most suitable basis. Here, the optimization
means the minimization of the Shannon entropy of the coefficients. We note that both the adaptive representation [10] and
the nonuniformly spaced frequency scale [32] are also available
with RFs. Additionally, in our case the adaptation can be further
improved by varying the number of different poles at each segment. For localizing the best poles, we can use the dimensional
optimization process, i.e., the multidimensional (MD) PSO [24].
So our algorithm provides a time-varying power spectra, where
the density of the frequency distribution changes dynamically.
B. Most Significant Feature Element
Since our extracted features are coefficients of the t-f distribution, finding the most discriminative elements in the feature
vector indicates the frequency range, where epileptic seizure
patterns are mostly active. In order to determine the most sig-

nificant components in the feature vector, we sort the feature
elements in a supervised manner via an SVM. Using the whole
feature vector of the training set, the elements can be ranked
by using a recursive leave-one-out procedure according to the
weights of the support vectors [33]. One can see the top five most
significant elements for each classification task in Table V. For
five classification tasks, the most discriminative component of
the feature vector is the median value of the coefficients. In
addition, the most common elements in the top five ranking list
are the 10th, 11th, and 12th coefficients. Thus, it is expected that
the seizure patterns of set E should be more active in a specific
frequency subband. In order to illustrate this phenomenon, the
spectrograms of sets E and D were displayed in Fig. 7. As it
can be seen, the spectrum of set E possesses a higher magnitude
for the theta and alpha frequency subbands in contrast with the
spectrum of set D. Furthermore, the power spectrum of the tenth
rational component (c10 Φ10 ) shows a noticeable visual difference in the theta subband. Namely, seizure patterns of set E are
mostly active in a wider frequency range comparing to set D.
Comparison of the power spectra of the 20th rational component (c20 Φ20 ) of sets D and E shows that the dominant seizure
activity of set E is concentrated in the alpha frequency subband.
This explains the reason why the 20th coefficient is ranked as

the most significant feature element in the discrimination of sets
E and D.
C. Comparison With State-of-the-Art Methods
As a final performance assessment, we compare our method
with other state-of-the-art feature extraction techniques proposed for seizure classification in the literature. These methods
includes the following: 1) Wavelet analysis, which decomposes
an EEG signal into five frequency subbands by using secondorder Daubechies (db2) wavelet transform. The feature vector
consists of the maximum, minimum, average, and standard deviation of the wavelet coefficients of each subband [34], [35].
2) Entropy-based feature extraction using Shannon entropy,
log-energy entropy, and sample entropy [36]. 3) Spectral analysis applying Welch FFT power spectral density (PSD) [1].
4) Approximate entropy-based feature extraction [37]. For all
of these methods, the same MLP classifier was used by feeding
50% of the data in the learning phase. As it can be seen in Table VI, our method is mostly ranked as the first or the second best
approach in terms of classification accuracy. It can outperform
both the entropy and the approximate entropy-based feature
extraction methods in all classification tasks. Besides, due to
consideration of all coefficients in Welch PSD-based method, a
large-dimensional feature vector is obtained in contrast with our
method which uses only 32 + 5 features. For this reason, training the classifier by the proposed compact features is faster. Our
approach is ranked first together with the wavelet-based method
on average. Moreover, the high accuracy level obtained by the
proposed method in the classification task 6 demonstrates its
ability to discriminate between epileptic seizure and seizurefree epochs in the presence of an imbalanced EEG data.

Finally, we compare the proposed algorithm with the results
of some state-of-the-art epilepsy detection methods reported in
the literature using the same dataset. We consider the classification accuracies of the same classification tasks, which are
summarized in Table VII. For the classification tasks (E-B) and
(E-C), our method achieved the best results with a significant improvement comparing to the others. It is ranked second best for
the classification task (E-D), where the difference is about 0.6%.
In addition, the proposed method is close to the best scores in
terms of the highest classification accuracy, where the difference
is 0.2% and 2% for the classification tasks (E-A) and (E-A, B,
C, D), respectively. The deviation is caused by the high variance
between the pole(s) and the coefficients. More precisely, in each
segment the optimal value of the pole is selected via a stochastic search method using the hyperbolic modification of the basic
PSO algorithm [25]. Furthermore, altering the pole(s) changes
the basis functions as well. This procedure can affect the variance of the extracted coefficients, which can cause variations
in the classification results. In order to address this problem, a
higher number of coefficients can be extracted and fed to the
classifier, which will attempt to fit better the underlying distribution. In addition, a more sophisticated classification approach
such as ensemble learning with bagging techniques can be considered. Such techniques may reduce the variance between the
poles and coefficients by using, e.g., bootstrap replicates.
VII. CONCLUSION
The main contribution of this paper is to provide an effective
and novel feature extraction algorithm for epileptic seizure detection in EEG signals. We proposed the rational DSTFT, which
is an adaptive generalization of the classical STFT. Additionally, we described the epileptic seizure patterns in the t-f domain
by using different types of RFs. In order to increase the efficiency, we investigated both the optimal number of coefficients
and the best window size. Moreover, we analyzed the proposed
features in order to determine the most significant ones. The performance of different rational systems was compared with the
classical STFT in terms of classification accuracy. Furthermore,
we increased the adaptability of our method by applying the
stochastic hyperbolic PSO algorithm to determine the optimal
position of the pole for each EEG epoch. For this reason, the
proposed method gives a compact t-f representation of the signal. We also showed that the inverse rational DSTFT achieves
a reconstruction signal with a smaller MSE compared to the
classical STFT for the same number of coefficients. Finally, we
compared the performance of our feature extraction procedure
with 13 Cohen’s class t-f distributions. Several state-of-the-art
feature extraction methods were taken into account, which are
commonly used in epileptic seizure detection and classification. The comparative study shows that the proposed rational
DSTFT can be used as a robust feature extraction method in offline epilepsy analysis and detection. In addition, the proposed
algorithm uses results from the recently developed theory of
signal models for rational orthogonal systems. As confirmed by
experiments, the MT rational DSTFT can be successfully applied to perform epileptic seizure pattern detection in EEGs.

We note that, the adaptability of the system can be further improved by using MDPSO [24], [50] to determine the optimum
number of unique poles. The MDPSO can explore multidimensional search spaces while it will converge to the best pole
configuration in the optimal dimension. In this latter case, we
can describe each segment with a set of poles and multiplicities.
By taking the advantage of the adaptive behavior of the rational representations, we expect that our method can perform
well on longer EEG recordings as well. Hence, future work will
focus on the use of rational DSTFT in multichannel long-term

epileptic seizure detection in order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed method in the presence of high-frequency
EEG activities (i.e., high gamma > 50 Hz) as was suggested in
[51]. For this purpose, we shall test our future algorithms on
larger datasets such as Physionet [29] that contains more variability between seizure and seizure-free epochs. Furthermore,
using long-term EEG records, we can evaluate the performance
of future methods for real-time seizure detection by measuring
the delay of detected seizures onset.
