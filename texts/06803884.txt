Combining Multiobjective Optimization and Cluster
Analysis to Study Vocal Fold Functional Morphology
Anil Palaparthi, Member, IEEE, Tobias Riede, and Ingo R. Titze∗

Abstract—Morphological design and the relationship between
form and function have great influence on the functionality of
a biological organ. However, the simultaneous investigation of
morphological diversity and function is difficult in complex natural systems. We have developed a multiobjective optimization
(MOO) approach in association with cluster analysis to study the
form-function relation in vocal folds. An evolutionary algorithm
(NSGA-II) was used to integrate MOO with an existing finite element model of the laryngeal sound source. Vocal fold morphology
parameters served as decision variables and acoustic requirements
(fundamental frequency, sound pressure level) as objective functions. A two-layer and a three-layer vocal fold configuration were
explored to produce the targeted acoustic requirements. The mutation and crossover parameters of the NSGA-II algorithm were
chosen to maximize a hypervolume indicator. The results were expressed using cluster analysis and were validated against a brute
force method. Results from the MOO and the brute force approaches were comparable. The MOO approach demonstrated
greater resolution in the exploration of the morphological space.
In association with cluster analysis, MOO can efficiently explore
vocal fold functional morphology.

I. INTRODUCTION
UNCTIONAL morphology investigates the relationship
between anatomical form and behavior. In biology, innovation in design and the form-function relationship have great influence on the evolution of diversity in systems [1]. In medicine,
the repair of a damaged mechanical structure and the formfunction relationship impact the performance of the organ after
recovery. Investigating morphological diversity and function simultaneously is especially difficult in complex systems, but
computational simulations can provide new insights. Here, we

Inside the larynx are two vocal folds positioned. (b) Schematic of the enlarged

morphology of the vocal folds determines their oscillation behavior. Vocal folds
in humans and many other mammals are multilayer structures. A deep layer

used multiobjective optimization (MOO) [2] pp. 227–298] to
investigate morphological variety and vocal function of vocal
folds. Associating MOO with cluster analysis provides a new
approach to evaluate trends generated by the utilized evolutionary algorithms.
Vocalization for singing and speaking is a highly complex
behavior, intimately related to the process of energy conversion.
The vocal fold oscillation rate determines the sound fundamental frequency (Fo ), and their oscillation amplitude contributes to
the sound amplitude (“sound pressure level,” SPL). Generating
sound by vocal fold oscillations is complex (see Fig. 1): (a) lung
pressure must be generated, (b) vocal fold mechanical properties determine their oscillation behavior, (c) neuromechanical
properties of involved muscles determine active movements of
larynx and vocal tract. The high dimensionality of the vocal
system makes predictions of effects on voice quality generated
by perturbations at a single point in the system very difficult.
Voice simulation used in this study was based on control in
two domains: 1) flow-induced oscillation of collapsible tissue
walls to produce sound, and 2) propagation of sound in airways [3] pp. 80–135]. Finite-element and finite-difference approaches are used to solve differential equations [4], that govern
air and tissue movement. Similar approaches have been taken by
others [5]–[11]. We utilize a modified Bernoulli flow calculation
coupled with a few hundred finite elements for tissue vibration,
striking a balance between a sufficient number of iterations (for
accuracy and stability) and computation time.

The voice simulator and MOO are integrated by an evolutionary algorithm, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II
(NSGA-II) [12]. The algorithm searches for optimal solutions
that are diverse and globally distributed. It produces multiple
generations of populations that contain alternative nondominated solutions. The MOO is more efficient than a brute-force
search that explores space at a predefined resolution. The solutions are viable and characterized by different phenotypic features (here two acoustic parameters:F̄0 , SPL). The solutions of
each new generation are closer to the predefined target objectives. The use of evolutionary algorithms to study functional
vocal fold morphology has two advantages over other optimization techniques. First, multiple solutions are generated reflecting
natural variation at the individual level. They also demonstrated
that the vocal organ can facilitate very similar vocal features by
multiple solutions. Second, for surgical repair, a compromise
is sought between tissue reconstruction (targeting a predamage
shape) and establishing a sufficient voice quality and long-term
tissue survival.
II. PROBLEM DEFINITION
The goal of this study was to develop a tool for obtaining
alternate vocal fold morphological solutions that allow voice
production within targeted ranges of voice features based on an
evolutionary algorithm. The MOO technique operates with vocal fold morphology parameters as decision variables, and with
voice acoustic requirements as objective functions. Constraints
can be imposed on both, morphology and acoustic requirements.
We developed a computational mapping procedure that delivers
20 alternative solutions per population. Each solution is viable,
i.e., a sustained voice is produced. The algorithm is run for 500
generations, producing 10 000 solutions. Each new generation
contains solutions that are closer to the target morphology than
those from the previous generation.
Section III first outlines the voice simulator. Then, the evolutionary algorithm is explained, and finally details of the integration of the voice simulator with the evolutionary algorithm are
presented.
III. METHODS
A. Voice Simulator—A Vocal Fold Finite Element Model
Vocal fold dynamics includes fast and small amplitude oscillatory movements in which various layers of the vocal fold are
vibrating. The implementation of vocal fold morphology is outlined in Fig. 2. Soft tissue of the vibrating portion of each vocal
fold was divided into triangular elements in the coronal plane
and into rectangular layers in the ventro-dorsal direction (along
the length of the vocal folds) as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). The
number of elements was chosen to capture two principal modes
of oscillation [13], [14]. These modes are based on approximate
half-wavelength standing waves in the dorso-ventral direction
and half-wavelength standing waves in the caudo-cranial direction on the vocal fold surfaces. We used 12 elements in the
caudo-cranial direction, which would be 24 elements per wave-

length. In the dorso-ventral direction, the number of elements
was 10.
Mammalian vocal folds consist of several layers of tissue [see
Fig. 2(c)] each characterized by specific biomechanical properties. The current simulation investigated a vocal fold with two
layers and a vocal fold with three layers. In the three layer vocal fold, the outermost layer is the mucosa. Underneath is the
vocal ligament consisting of extracellular matrices of collagen
and elastin proteins. All layers contain glycosaminoglycans like
hyaluronan. Lateral to the lamina propria is a muscle (musculus thyroarytenoideus) which demonstrates passive and active
stress response characteristics. In our model, the material is
considered isotropic in a plane transverse to the dorso-ventral
fiber direction. In essence, the tissue is an orthotropic fiber-gel
compound.
Tissue vibration is solved with the planar viscoelastic equation of motion [13] p. 178],

where x and z are space variables in the coronal plane, ξ and

μ is the shear modulus in the coronal place, ν is the Poisson
ratio, and μ is the shear modulus in any plane perpendicular
to the coronal plane. The variable μ contains the tension in the
tissue fibers that are imposed by moveable boundary conditions.

frequencies is expressed by the relation

and the planar Poisson ratio ν is taken to be as close to 1.0 as
numerically feasible. The tissue density ρ is 1.04 g/cm3 . This
leaves only two elastic variables, μ and μ , to be selected as
control variables. By far the dominant one of these is μ for frequency of oscillation. μ describes the tension in the tissue fibers,
and tension in the tissue fibers is the primary restoring force and
largely determines F0 [43]. Hence, we chose μ for parameter
variation. Amplitude of oscillation is controlled primarily by
lung pressure. The constitutive equation for the fiber-gel substance is embedded in (1), defined by the shear elastic moduli
and the poisson ratio. FEM solution includes a shear viscosity
η.
There are six boundaries for the vibrating portion of each
vocal fold. Tissue fibers originate or insert into these boundaries laterally, ventrally, and dorsally. Tissue oscillation is constrained to be zero on these surfaces because the boundary movement is postural, not oscillatory [see Fig. 2(d)]. In the study
reported here, all postural movements occur prior to phonation,

mesh requirements.

not during phonation. Aerodynamic and acoustic pressures apply cranially, caudally, and medially, and tissue vibration is
unconstrained. The boundary conditions are formulated as displacements at the nodes of each finite element. Interpolation
functions are derived to express displacements and velocities
inside each element. More details on the implementation of the
vocal system by finite element modeling can be found elsewhere
(e.g., [13], [15], [16]).
The finite-element construct allows solution of the partial
differential equations [13] pp. 214–231]. The most important
boundary for driving pressures is the medial surface of the vocal
folds, which is parameterized as

plane, ξ01 and ξ02 are lower and upper abduction from the y-z

bulging parameter that gives curvature to the medial surface.
Oscillation of the vocal folds is self-sustained by airflow between the vocal folds. This airflow is computed by the equation

is the effective combined vocal tract area, made up of the subglottal area As and epiglottal area Ae . In the above, ad is the flow
detachment area in the glottis, ke is a transglottal pressure coefficient (approximately 1.1), ρ is air density, c is sound velocity,
p+
s is the subglottal incident pressure (steady plus acoustic), and
p−
e is the supraglottal incident pressure (also steady plus acoustic). A wave reflection algorithm [13] pp. 319–334], [17], [18]

is used to solve all the acoustic wave pressures in the vocal tract,
which was modeled as uniform tube of 17.5 cm length and 2 cm
diameter. Pressures in the glottis are solved with Bernoulli’s
energy equation below flow detachment and with jet stream
equations above flow detachment [13] pp. 270–279].
B. Optimization Algorithm
Given a set of decision variables x ∈ X, a generic multiobjective optimization problem is defined as maximizing or
minimizing the objective functions F (x) ∈ Y , subject to the
constraint information g (x) ≤ 0 and h (x) = 0. Here, X is the
decision variable space, Y is the objective function space, which
can be weighted according to objective priority function w (y)
to determine the relevance of each objective function to the individual. The constraints determine the set of feasible solutions
where g corresponds to inequality constraints and h corresponds
to equality constraints.
There are several MOO techniques and their comparison
studies available [12], [19]–[23]. A critical feature of MOO
techniques is how they use constraints information [24].
The NSGA-II has been chosen for our purpose because of its elitist approach, low computational cost, handling of constraints,
better spread of solutions, and better convergence to the true
pareto-optimal front [12].
1) Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm: The NSGA-II
is a genetic algorithm that uses evolutionary strategies to generate populations of solutions in each generation. An arithmetic
crossover and Gaussian mutation generate offspring population
of individuals from parent population. Solutions are the optimal individuals that are the outcome of the optimization in each
generation. The binary tournament selection method chooses
individuals for next generation from a combined parent and offspring population. The NSGA-II algorithm uses nondominated
sorting method [12] for sorting individuals into different nondomination levels and crowding distance method [25] to sort

2202

3) Gaussian Mutation: Mutation is used in optimization algorithms to maintain diversity in individuals from one generation to the next [27]. The Gaussian mutation function is given
as

where O is the offspring, σ denotes standard deviation of the
random number r2 generated, s is a scalar that decreases the
mutation range as the optimization progress forward, Gi is the
current generation number, Gm is the maximum number of
generations, and bu and bl are the upper and lower bounds of
the offspring, respectively.
4) Binary Tournament Selection: A binary tournament selects individuals for next generation. Individuals are chosen
above others based on their pareto front number and crowding
distance [28]. An individual with lower pareto front number is
chosen if the two individuals are from different pareto fronts
and the individual with larger crowding distance is chosen if
the two individuals are from the same Pareto front. The crowding distance is computed on objective function values sorted
in ascending order within the parent population. The crowding
distance equation derived by Mehdipour [29] is given as

either side of the current individual in the sorted list, Min and
Max are the minimum and maximum values of the objective
function in the sorted list, respectively.

individuals within the same level. An individual dominates another individual if it is strictly better in at least one objective
and no worse in all the other objectives. All individuals that are
not dominated by any other individuals in the objective space
form the first nondomination level called pareto front 1. The individuals that are dominated only by individuals in pareto front
1 form the pareto front 2 and so on. The step by step procedure
of NSGA-II algorithm is provided in Fig. 3 as a flowchart.
2) Arithmetic Crossover Function: A crossover function
generates two offsprings from two parent individuals [26]. The
offsprings have the best characteristics of the two parent individuals. The arithmetic crossover function is given as
O1 = r1 cP1 + (1 − r1 c) P2

(6)

O2 = (1 − r1 c) P1 + r1 cP2

(7)

where P1 is parent 1, P2 is parent 2, O1 is offspring 1, O2
is offspring 2, r1 is a random number, and c is a scalar called
crossover fraction. The crossover fraction controls the closeness
of offsprings to the parents. A small number of c keeps the new
solutions close to the old ones.

One key morphology parameter of the vocal folds for fundamental frequency control μ /μ was used as a decision variable.
Acoustic output variables F̄0 and SPL were the objective functions. Restrictions on the morphology and acoustic variables
were the constraints of the optimization algorithm. The acoustic priority weights were all set to 1. A single run of the finite
element model to generate 0.4 s of voice signal requires about
11 s to complete. It took about 30 h to complete an optimization
simulation with a population size of 20 and 500 generations,
yielding 10 000 solutions.
1) Morphology Parameters: Vocal folds demonstrate a
species-specific layer structure (e.g., [30], [31]). Each layer is
characterized by length L, thickness T , depth D, bottom ξ01 ,
and top ξ02 x-position, bulging B, viscosity η, longitudinal μ ,
and transverse μ shear modulus.
In our current experiment, subglottal pressure and longitudinal shear moduli μ of each vocal fold layer were varied during
optimization (see Table I). The current presentation focuses on
longitudinal shear modulus because it is the single most important parameter affecting F̄0 . The left and right vocal folds
were considered symmetric. In vector form, the morphological

parameters were written as
X=

[PL , μ1 , μ2 , . . .]

(10)

where PL is the subglottal pressure, μ1 is the longitudinal shear
modulus of layer 1, μ2 is the longitudinal shear modulus of layer
2, and so on. Layers are concatenated as needed.
2) Acoustic Requirements: Several acoustic parameters can
be measured for simulated voice production. Investigators in
human speech and voice research have established norms for
mean fundamental frequency F̄0 and mean sound pressure level
SPL . Similar data exist for some animals. Acoustic requirements alter with species, gender, age, etc. In vector form, the
acoustic requirements considered here are given as a dot product


(11)
Y = W · F̄0 , SPL
where W is a priority vector that gives a weight to each acoustic
parameter. Weights can range between 0 (assigning lowest importance to an acoustic parameter) and 1 (highest importance)
such that the sum of all the weights will be equal to 1. In this
study, W for both parameters was considered to be 1.
3) Constraints: Restrictions are imposed on both morphological and acoustic variables. These restrictions set ranges of
each variable based on published values (see Table I). Constraints are also set on the ratio of transverse to longitudinal
shear modulus μ /μ of each layer. These restrictions will guide
the optimization of morphological parameters in achieving the
desired acoustic requirements.
D. Presentation of Results and Performance Assessment
The MOO algorithm was programmed to generate a population of 20 solutions in each generation. It is customary in
studies using MOO techniques to present the solutions of the
last generation, given that they are closest to the true pareto
front among all generations. However, our concern is to explore
the relationship between the morphology and the acoustic space.
Hence, we chose to present all the individual solutions that were
generated by the crossover and mutation algorithms during the
optimization rather than just the optimal solutions of the final
generation. This has the advantage of exploring the parameter
space for viable solutions, similar to a brute force approach

with random parameter variations. However, greater resolution
and more rapid convergence are expected with predefined target
morphology and acoustic spaces.
The performance of the NSGA-II algorithm is measured
across generations as it gives an indication of how many generations are needed for the algorithm to converge to the true
pareto front and the optimal mutation and crossover parameters needed [32]. The performance of the NSGA-II algorithm
across generations has been measured using hypervolume indicator [32].
1) Cluster Analysis: The objective is to obtain multiple alternate solutions of morphology parameters for the desired
acoustic output. Hence, the results from the optimization were
presented as clusters of solutions between decision and objective spaces. The optimization algorithm was altered to store the
generated individuals and their corresponding acoustic outputs
across all generations. The combinations of each of the morphology and acoustic spaces were then analyzed using cluster
analysis. The clusters are computed using Gaussian mixture
models (GMM), which were formed by combining multivariate
normal density components [33]. An expectation maximization algorithm assigned posterior probabilities to each component density with respect to each observation. Clusters were
formed by selecting the component that maximizes the posterior
probability.
2) Hypervolume Indicator: A hypervolume indicator is a
measure of space covered by solutions in the objective space
[32]. It measures this space with respect to a reference point that
is dominated by all points in the objective space. Considering
minimization of objectives to be the goal of the optimization, the
point containing the maximum value of each objective function
will be a good reference since it will be dominated by any
other point in the objective space. The hypervolume indicator
can be measured on a single point or group of points. When
a single point is considered, the hypervolume is the product
of individual differences between the reference point and the
point of interest (i.e., the volume of the hypercube between the
point and the reference). When group of points is considered,
the hypervolume is the union of all hypercubes between the
reference point and the points in the group [25].

2204

Here, we compute the hypervolume of each generation (i.e.,
group of 20 solutions) to see the progress of the NSGA-II algorithm across generations. The objective functions are normalized
to their maximum values. So, the hypervolume will always lie
between 0 and 1 with 1 corresponding to the best solution. If
better solutions are obtained in each generation of the optimization, the hypervolume will increase across generations.
E. Validation of MOO Simulation Results
1) Sound Output Validation: In order to test whether a simulation generated a sustained voice signal, i.e., resulted in a
successful voice simulation, each simulation was investigated
for its periodicity over time. We used simple peak detection which detects periodicity in the time-domain envelope by
measuring the period of the envelope peaks. A sufficient number of consecutively matching periods (limiting the range of frequencies that are acceptable for a periodicity from 30 to 400 Hz)
are interpreted as the presence of a periodic voice signal. A
standard deviation of the peak values less than 0.01 was used
as selection criterion for a sustained voice signal. The measure
proofed to be robust in a subsample of 500 simulations for which
the outcome was visually confirmed in a spectrogram. F̄0 is computed using standard autocorrelation method [34] and SPL is
computed as a pressure measured at 30 cm from the mouth with
reference to a standard pressure of 20 μPa [3] p. 221].
2) Brute Force Search: An alternative way to explore the
relationship between two spaces is through brute force search
by systematically varying the parameters in the input space and
finding the corresponding values in the output space. But, there
are inherent issues with the brute force search. The computational cost increases steeply with the increase in resolution
and the number of variables in the input (morphology)
 space.

The computational cost of brute force search is O K N , where
N is the number of decision variables and K is the number
of points per decision variable. For simplicity, we assumed an
equal number of points for each decision variable.
The
 com
putational cost of the NSGA-II algorithm is O M G2 , where
M is the number of objective functions and G is the number
of generations [12]. Only two variables were explored in this
study, but in future studies, cases might require up to 100 morphological parameters to be varied simultaneously [indicated
by the compartmentalization in Fig. 2(c)], which is not practical for a brute force approach but can be easily handled by the
MOO as the number of generations will not increase dramatically with morphology parameters. Furthermore, the number of
objectives will remain low. There is also no means to impose
constraints on the output (acoustic) space, leading to exploration
of regions of no interest. These problems can be overcome by
using MOO techniques which only explores regions of interest
set by constraints and the resolution in the morphology space
is controlled by mutation and crossover functions. Hence, we
used coarse brute force search only to validate our results from
MOO simulations.
F. Two Case Studies—A Two-Layer and a Three-Layer Vocal
Fold System
In order to test the applicability of MOO approach to optimize
vocal fold morphology, we ran two test cases. Optimization was

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 7, JULY 2014

performed on fiber stress in a two layer and a three layer vocal
fold system (see Table I). There are two reasons to use these two
specific case studies. First, the number of layers represents an
important distinctive feature in vocal fold design among mammals. Species-specific vocal fold design and vocal repertoire
are linked [31], [35], [36], [40]. Second, the two-layer and the
three-layer systems provide a contrast between human and tiger
vocal fold design. Both have been studied in sufficient detail to
facilitate the finite element model [30], [31], [37]. In this study,
we implemented tiger data for the two layer vocal fold, and
human data for the three layer vocal fold.
1) Parameters for Test Cases: The objective of the optimization was to produce F̄0 of 130 Hz (three-layer vocal fold) and
80 Hz (2-layer vocal fold), respectively, SPL of 70 dB (threelayer vocal fold) and 110 dB (two-layer vocal fold) at a distance
of 30 cm from the lips, respectively. The two layer system has
been referred to as a body-cover system and the three layer system represents mucosa, ligament, and muscle. Left–right symmetry was imposed. Each parameter has lower and upper bounds
for their respective cases. The parameters and their bounds are
listed in Table I. The objective function for the three-layer vocal
fold is written in terms of quadratic error functions

(13)

The two errors were minimized with equal acoustic priority. In the decision space, the subglottal pressure was varied between 0.01–2 kPa for three-layer vocal folds and 0.01–
3 kPa for two-layer vocal fold system. The longitudinal
shear modulus of each layer was varied between 5000 to
100 000dyn/cm2 . There were no restrictions on the ratios of
longitudinal shear modulus of different layers. The geometric
parameters (L, T, D, B, ξ01 , ξ02 ), the transverse shear modulus μ, and the viscosity η of the layers were kept constant at
their nominal values throughout the optimization. The nominal
values for (L, T, D, B, ξ01 , ξ02 , μ and η) for a three-layer system are (1.0 cm, 0.5 cm, 0.5 cm, 0, 0.01 cm, 0.01 cm, 5000
dyn/cm2 , and 2 poise), respectively, and for a two-layer system
are (4 cm, 5 cm, 3 cm, 0, 0.05 cm, 0.05 cm, 5000 dyn/cm2 , and 3
poise), respectively. The vocal tract length of three-layer system
is considered as 17.5 cm and for two-layer system as 40 cm.
2) Parameters for NSGA-II Algorithm: The NSGA-II
multiobjective optimization algorithm was implemented in
MATLAB. The optimal solutions and the individuals considered in each generation were stored for later analysis. The
parameters of the NSGA-II algorithm that needed to be set
are the number of generations, population size, crossover fraction, mutation scale, and shrink. The outcome of the optimization algorithm depended on the choice of these parameters. For a fixed population size and number of generations,
we varied the crossover fraction (c), mutation scale (σ), and
shrink (s) and ran the optimization on the three-layer vocal
fold system. We considered eight combinations of these three
parameters. The combination that gave the maximum Hypervolume Indicator across generations was chosen as the optimal

Indicator for every 50 generations of these eight combinations
is shown in Fig. 4. The set H (σ − 0.5, s − 0.2, c − 1.2) generates larger Hypervolume across all generations whereas the set
G (σ − 0.5, s − 0.2, c − 0.7) generates larger Hypervolume in
the last 50 generations. Since we considered solutions from all
generations for our analysis, we chose set H to be the optimal
combination. These values are listed in Table II.
IV. RESULTS
A. Two-Layer Vocal Fold
Fiber stress relations for a two layer system plotted against
two acoustic variables are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). The density
of solutions is illustrated by the contour lines in cluster maps
[see Fig. 5(c) and (d)]. The acoustic priorities for the two layer
system were low F̄0 (80 Hz) and high SPL (110 dB). Results
show high density clusters for F̄0 reaching between 90 and
100 Hz [see Fig. 5(c)] and for SPL around 110 dB [Fig. 5(d)].
Both priorities are achieved with a translayer ratio (μ2 /μ1 ) near
and below 1, suggesting that a homogenous system (both layers
equal), or a system with a slightly stiffer superficial layer, helps
to obtain the desired low F̄0 and high SPL requirements.
Results demonstrated also that viable solutions are not limited
to a single cluster [high density cluster in Fig. 5(c)]. For both
F̄0 and SPL, there are second clusters of lower density. The

respective values for F̄0 and SPL, are lower, and the associated
translayer fiber tension ratio is increased.
The results from the optimization were validated against results from the brute force search [see Fig. 6(a)–(d)]. In the brute
force search, the parameters in the morphological space are varied systematically without MOO convergence criteria and the
corresponding values in the acoustic space are measured. The
subglottal pressure PL is varied from 0.01 to 3 kPa in increments
of 0.1 kPa and the longitudinal shear modulus is varied from
5000 to 100 000 dyn/cm2 in increments of 5000 dyn/cm2 . The
density resolution is lower in the brute force approach [compare
Fig. 5(a) and 6(a), or 5(b) and 6(b)]. Like in the optimization
approach, two to three clusters were formed, associated with a

2206

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 7, JULY 2014

Brute force results are shown in Fig. 8(a–d). Subglottal pressure (PL ) was varied from 0.01 to 2 kPa in increments of
0.1 kPa. Longitudinal shear modulus of the three layers was
varied from 5000 to 100 000 dyn/cm2 in increments of 7500
dyn/cm2 . Exploring the entire morphological space by brute
force took five times longer than the MOO approach. Most viable solutions cluster at translayer ratios of 1.
There is good agreement between the optimization and brute
force search results as can be seen from Figs. 7 and 8. This indicates that MOO acts as an alternative to the brute force search,
but is more efficient and faster in searching for a relationship
between the targeted objective and decision spaces.

shift in the location of the centroids of the clusters (see Table I).
One implicit acoustic requirement imposed on both approaches
is self-sustained oscillation, which governs the overall range of
solutions.
B. Three-Layer Vocal Fold
For the three-layer system, we focus the graphic analysis on
the translayer ratio (μ2 /μ1 ) because layers 1 and 2 are exposed
and interacting with the passing air flow. The translayer ratio is
again close to 1 for F̄0 and SPL (see Fig. 7(a) and (b); Table I).
This indicates that, like in the two layer system, the tissue is
almost homogenous if the vocal fold is optimized for low F̄0 .
High SPL [see Fig. 7(b)] is also achieved if layer 2 is as or less
stiff than layer 1.

The use of the MOO technique to explore simultaneously a
decision space (morphology) and an objective space (acoustic
variables) provided two important insights that will help in future explorations of functional morphology of vocal folds. First,
MOO is superior to single objective optimization algorithms
because it generates multiple alternate solutions in a single run.
The combination of MOO with cluster analysis provides the
power to evaluate solutions simultaneously in both decision and
objective spaces. Because of the use of mutation to generate
populations, a good solution tends to generate more good solutions around it, forming clusters. Second, since there is considerable overlap in solutions between MOO and brute force
search, both methods recognize spaces that are viable for voice
production. One important implicit criterion common to both
approaches is that self-sustained oscillation must occur. This
probably accounts for the similarities between solutions in the
two approaches. The morphological parameter space that does
not support sustained voice production will not show up in the
results. The observation that cluster spaces for MOO solutions
and for brute force solution overlap is therefore not surprising.
The two approaches (MOO plus cluster analysis and brute force)
generated similar results and were not too dramatically different
in computation time. However, in the future, when we consider
more than just two parameters, the faster computation time of
the MOO approach will be apparent. Furthermore, resolution of
MOO approach is higher, in particular near the optimal solutions. MOO will specifically explore the area around an optimal
solution and ignore an area of inferior or no solution. In contrast, the brute force approach will explore each aspect of the
morphology space with equal resolution.
A. Two Case Studies—A Low Pitched Voice is Well Generated
With a Homogenous Vocal Fold
The interesting result here was that MOO suggests translayer
ratios near and below 1 for both the two-layer and three-layer
vocal fold. This corresponds with empirical data. First, the two
layer system was modeled after the tiger vocal fold lamina
propria which consists of two layers, a deep layer with relatively
high fat content (not stiff), and a stiffer superficial layer with
highly organized collagen fiber content [31], i.e., the translayer
ratio (μ2 /μ1 ) is smaller than 1. In the three-layer vocal fold,
which was modeled after a human vocal fold, mechanical

PALAPARTHI et al.: COMBINING MOO AND CLUSTER ANALYSIS TO STUDY VOCAL FOLD FUNCTIONAL MORPHOLOGY

properties for low F̄0 vocalization also performs best with a
translayer ratio close to 1. In other words, mucosa and ligament
should be nearly homogenous. Low F̄0 vocalization, as in
speech, is easily produced when both mucosal and ligamental
tissue is lax so that optimal energy transfer can occur from glottal airflow into the tissue [3]. For high-pitched productions (not
investigated here), the results may be very different, however.
The ligament must become very stiff (tense), which means that
the translayer ratio for μ may be quite different from 1.0.
B. MOO to Study Functional Morphology
Traditionally, studies using MOO techniques present results
only in the objective space, but rarely in the decision space.
Obtaining optimal solutions in the objective space is the primary goal in such studies. In contrast, the problem investigated
here was to better understand the relationship between the decision space and the objective space. The larynx as a vocal organ
can naturally produce a large range of sounds, yet there are
specializations facilitating species-specific vocal behavior [35],
and there is large interest in predicting what small changes
to the integrity of the vocal folds will do to the voice of a person [38], [39]. The cluster analysis helps to relate morphological
to acoustic spaces. Weights provide the possibility to evaluate
parameters in the decision space differently. For example, SPL
might be most important for one condition tolerating tradeoffs
in F0 (WSPL > WF 0 ). In the simulations presented here, we assigned equal priority to both parameters (W = 1). In the future
studies, it will also be interesting to explore tradeoffs between
various acoustic features and vocal fold morphology, i.e., between objective and decision space.
Furthermore, current data confirm that more than one solution
is possible. High density clusters were close to target variables
(F̄0 and SPL). However, additional clusters indicated that with
different acoustic priorities, different morphologies may be favored. For example, trends were seen that higher pitches were
associated with a larger translayer ratio [see Fig. 7(c)]. The nonisotropic (fiber-gel) nature of the different layers within a human
vocal fold would account for this shift in the translayer ratio.
The analysis of complex relationships between function and
morphology is challenging in many fields of research [42]. The
MOO approach in association with cluster analysis appears to
provide a route to explore this relationship.
