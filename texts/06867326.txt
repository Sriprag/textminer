A Clinically Applicable Stochastic Approach
for Noninvasive Estimation of Aortic Stiffness
Using Computed Tomography Data
Ferdinando Auricchio, Michele Conti, Anna Ferrara∗ , and Ettore Lanzarone

Abstract—The degeneration of the vascular wall tissue induces
a change of the arterial stiffness, i.e., the capability of the vessel to
distend under the pulsatile hemodynamic load. In the literature,
the aortic stiffness is usually computed following a simple deterministic approach, in which only the maximum and the minimum
values of arterial diameter and blood pressure over the cardiac
cycle are considered. In this paper, we propose a stochastic approach to assess the stiffness, and its spatial variation, of a given
aortic region exploiting patient-specific geometrical data derived
from computed tomography angiography (CTA). In particular, the
arterial stiffness is computed linking the aortic kinematic information derived from CTA with pressure waveforms, generated using a
lumped parameter model of the arterial circulation. The proposed
method is able to include the uncertainty of the input variables as
well as to use the entire diameter and blood pressure waveforms
over the cardiac cycle rather than only their maximum and minimum values. Although the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed
method are tested on a single patient-specific case, the proposed
approach is powerful and already possesses the ability to evaluate regional changes of stiffness in human aorta using noninvasive
data. The final objective of our paper is to support the adoption
of techniques such as CTA as a standard tool for diagnosis and
treatment planning of aortic diseases.

may determine severe life-threatening risk to patients if not
diagnosed early [3].
From the histological point of view, the development of aortic
diseases involves significant alterations in the arterial wall tissue, e.g., deposition of calcified materials, reduction in elastin
content, and/or plaque formation [2]. Such a tissue degeneration
induces a change in the so-called arterial stiffness, i.e., the capability of the vessel to vary its section secondary to blood pressure
variations. In recent years, great emphasis has been placed on
the role of arterial stiffness in the development of cardiovascular
diseases, recognizing it as a relevant predictor of cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality [4], [5]. Focusing our attention on the
aorta, changes of the vessel stiffness lead to increased systolic
and pulse pressures, which in turn may induce left ventricular
hypertrophy and failure (with possible stroke volume reduction),
aneurysm formation and rupture, and atherosclerosis [1], [6].
Consequently, the determination of arterial stiffness appears
to be fundamental for clinical purposes, but it should be performed in a noninvasive manner for large-scale diagnostic
screening. In this scenario, a useful approach consists of an
indirect evaluation of arterial stiffness, which involves in vivo
measurements of blood pressure waveform and wall displacement over the cardiac cycle. At present, given in vivo pressure
and diameter waveforms, the aortic stiffness is usually computed using only the maximum and the minimum values of
arterial diameter and blood pressure over the considered cardiac
cycle [7]–[9]. However, this approach neglects the information
carried out by the temporal trend of the observed variables and
does not include any evaluation about the uncertainty related
to the estimated stiffness. This paper aims at improving the estimation procedure; we propose a stochastic method to assess
the stiffness of a given aortic region and its spatial variation, exploiting the entire geometrical data and pressure waveforms and
providing the credibility interval of the estimates. Indeed, acquired geometrical and pressure information are linked through
a proper (linear elastic) constitutive model of the vessel wall
and, then, the aortic stiffness is computed using a Bayesian approach able to include the uncertainty of both the input variables
(diameter and pressure) and arterial stiffness.
Nowadays, the variation of the arterial diameter during the
cardiac cycle can be observed through a number of medical imaging techniques, such as dynamic X-ray angiography,
ultrasonography, computed tomography, and MRI [10]–[15].
Among them, the computed tomography angiography (CTA)
has become a standard tool for diagnosis and treatment planning of aortic diseases, as the level of technology has increased.

AURICCHIO et al.: CLINICALLY APPLICABLE STOCHASTIC APPROACH FOR NONINVASIVE ESTIMATION OF AORTIC STIFFNESS

In particular, recent advances in CT technology have made possible 4-D imaging of the aorta and its branches allowing coupling spatial 3-D and temporal information, so that multiple
CTA datasets can be acquired along the cardiac cycle [14], [16].
This technology has opened the doors to a number of studies
addressing the assessment of aortic dynamics, which is essential
for the planning of endovascular grafting [17], [18]. Hence, in
this paper, geometrical information are taken from CTA images.
Unfortunately, the availability of information regarding the
temporal variation of the aortic diameter cannot be straightforward complemented with the pressure counterpart. Direct noninvasive measurements of blood pressure in the central arteries
are not feasible up to now. In fact, direct measurement requires
catheterization, which is usually performed only during surgery
and not in the clinical routine.
Several approaches can be followed to get the information in
a noninvasive manner. The aortic pressure can simply substituted by the pressure measured on peripheral vessels (such as
brachial or radial arteries); however, this substitution may yield
misleading results because differences in the pressure waveform
are evidenced between peripheral and central vessels.
Considering a more accurate evaluation, two alternatives can
be followed. The first one is to generate the pressure waveforms by means of an appropriate mathematical model of the
arterial circulation. The advantage of this method is the capability of obtaining pressure waveforms in each particular segment
of the aorta. On the contrary, the disadvantage is that such a
model has to be calibrated with physiopathological parameters.
In the absence of patient-specific information, such parameters
are usually assumed equal to standard values that neglect the
peculiarities of the specific patient. The second approach is to
derive the aortic pressure from peripheral measurements, using
proper medical devices (see for example [19]). The advantage
of this method is to consider patient-specific data (i.e., his/ her
peripheral pressure waveform). However, also in this case, the
central aortic pressure is derived from the peripheral one by a
proper mathematical model implemented in the software of the
device. Hence, the benefits of considering patient specific data
mainly disappear when the propagation of the pressure waveform is included in the measurement process.
We adopt the first alternative and, among the possible mathematical models of the arterial circulation, we considered the
simplest one, i.e., a lumped parameter model [20], [21]. Alternatively, other mathematical model can be considered, e.g., the
pressure wave propagation along the circulatory system can be
estimated by solving a fluid-structure interaction problem between blood flow and arterial wall [22]–[24]; however, such an
approach may result in being computationally expensive.
In this paper, we present our approach, validating it with respect to a numerical test case. Moreover, we apply it on a clinical
case and we compare the results with those obtained using the
classical deterministic approach, in which only the maximum
and the minimum values of arterial diameter and blood pressure
over the cardiac cycle are taken. The final goal of this paper
is to support the adoption of noninvasive techniques in the real
clinical practice as a standard tool for large-scale diagnosis and
treatment planning of the aortic diseases. In this light, also the

177

adoption of devices already present in several health care facilities, i.e., the CTA, makes the proposed technique cheap and
applicable to several patients.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
The methodology adopted in the paper consists of three main
steps: 1) medical imaging analysis, 2) generation of aortic blood
pressure waveforms, 3) estimation of the aortic stiffness. The
last step is developed following both the standard literature approach and the Bayesian stochastic procedure. Consequently,
this section of paper is structured as follows. Section II-A deals
with the patient-specific anatomical reconstruction and the noninvasive measurement of cross-sectional aortic diameter change
along the cardiac cycle. Section II-B briefly recalls the adopted
lumped parameter model used for generating pressure waveforms, and describes some modifications introduced in such
a model to fit our problem. Then, the estimation of the stiffness is described, considering both the usual literature approach
(Section II-C1) and the stochastic approach (Section II-C2). Finally, the validation on a numerical test case is described in
Section II-D.
A. Medical Imaging Analysis
Medical image analysis aims at reconstructing a 3-D model
of a given arterial district through an image segmentation processing and then at obtaining information on the corresponding
anatomical changes of configuration over the cardiac cycle. The
adopted imaging analysis develops in the following three steps:
1) acquisition of patient-specific medical images, 2) segmentation and anatomical reconstruction of the lumen profile, 3) virtual slicing of the 3-D reconstruction to assess cross-sectional
contours at different sites.
The medical images used for the anatomical reconstruction
consist of CTA-image data (DICOM format) obtained by the
so-called 4-D electrocardiography (ECG)-gated CT. The ECG
technique allows synchronizing a series of CT scans with the
cardiac cycle through the ECG signal, obtaining different snapshots of the vascular district as function of the time (commonly
expressed as percentage of the R-R interval). In particular, the
4-D CT scans are acquired every 5% of the R–R interval, resulting in 20 CTA images (the last image at 100% is not acquired
as the cardiac cycle is repeated, and it is assumed equal to the
initial one at 0%).
For each CTA dataset and then for each time instant,
the anatomical reconstruction of the descending aorta lumen
profile was performed through a semiautomatic segmentation process [25], using the open source software ITK-Snap
(http://www.itksnap.org ) based on a 3-D active contour segmentation method [26]. The segmented models are exported
in stereolithography representation (STL format) for the subsequent virtual slicing of the 3-D reconstructions.
The slicing procedure is performed through the following
steps: 1) definition of the aortic centerline; 2) definition of n
cutting planes normal to the centerline and equally spaced along
the centerline; 3) detection of the cross-sectional contour points
in each plane and spline interpolation; 4) calculation of the

center of mass for each cross-sectional contour and computation
of the mean radius as the mean value of distances between the
center of mass and contour points. The whole processing is
implemented through a python-script exploring and combining
modules of VTK library (http://www.vtk.org ) and of VMTK
library (http://www.vmtk.org ).
It is worth noting that we keep the same cutting planes for
all the frames, where the cutting planes are computed using
the centerline referring to the first frame. Such an approximation is reasonable only under the working hypothesis that the
movement of the considered tract of the aorta is negligible. This
working hypothesis is admissible from physiologic point of view
because we are considering the descending tract of the thoracic
aorta, which is bounded by the surrounding tissue. Moreover, we
have confirmed such hypothesis on the analyzed clinical case.
In this study, we consider the case of a 74-year-old female
patient, presenting an asymptomatic 5.5-cm pseudoaneurysm at
the level of the distal anastomosis (eight years after ascending
aortic repair for aneurysm) and whose medical history includes
hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Because the patient declined
a new sternotomy and the anatomy of the lesion was suitable,
endovascular exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm was planned
using a custom-made stent graft (Bolton Medical, Inc., Sunrise,
FL, USA). The core of the graft scaffold is composed of three

self-expanding nitinol rings, having a 0.5 mm thickness, sutured
on the polyester vascular fabric; a slender nitinol ring is sutured
inside the fabric tube at each end. The proximal landing zone is
composed of a surgical graft, 30 mm in diameter, which shows
an elliptic shape with a maximum diameter of 37 mm [25].
For such a reason, the part of ascending aorta targeted by the
endovascular treatment is neglected in this study, so that the
vascular region of our interest reduces to part of descending
aorta.
Fig. 1 shows the vascular region of our interest (i.e., the descending aorta between the left subclavian and the diaphragm)
and some of the available CTA images, whereas Fig. 2 schematically shows the results of the implemented workflow with eight
considered cross sections in the region.
They refer to the analyzed clinical case, detailed in Section III.

B. Generation of Aortic Blood Pressure Waveforms
As mentioned, the absence of noninvasive methods for directly measuring pressure waveforms in the aorta motivates their
generation by means of a mathematical model. In this study, we
refer to the lumped parameter model of the arterial tree proposed
in [20] and [21]. Such a model describes the arterial tree from

the aortic valve to the capillaries by means of 63 large artery
segments and 30 peripheral networks, which are appropriately
connected in series and in parallel to reproduce the arterial system structure.
Each segment is represented by an electrical circuit, in which
tension and electric current are the analogous of pressure and
flow in the vessel, respectively. Thanks to the electrical analogy,
each segment is characterized by two ordinary differential equations, one for blood pressure and one for blood flow. Moreover,
each segment is characterized by resistances, inductances, and
compliances, whose values are given by the vessel geometrical and mechanical properties (properties for each segment are
taken from [27]). The input of the overall tree is represented by
the blood flow through the aortic valve, which is analytically described by the Swanson and Clark expression [28]. The model is
applied neglecting the regulatory systems, which are conversely
included in [20] and [21].
Since we are interested in the generation of a specific waveform for each considered cross section, we have modified the

existing lumped parameter model in order to increase the
number of large artery segments in the observed aortic region.
Hence, the same tract is modeled by a higher number of segments in series, each one with a reduced length. The aim is to
obtain as many segments in the observed aortic piece as the number of the sections. Consequently, as highlighted by Fig. 3, the
segments 3 and 4 are split in eight subsegments corresponding to
the eight sections; the corresponding parameters are reported in
Table I.
The aim of this manipulation is to impose an univocal correspondence between the subsegments of lumped parameter
model to the acquired cross-sectional data, imposing the intrasubsegment distance equal to the intrasection distance. According to [20] and [21], simulations are conducted considering
physiological hematic parameters while the inlet aortic flow, the
average flow, and the pulse period are tuned to accomplish a reference literature value of 5 L/min and a duration of one cardiac
cycle equal to 0.8 s, as indicated by the metadata of the adopted
CTA dataset.

The relation between the adopted subsegments and the corresponding aortic cross section derived from medical images, i.e.,
CTA, are reported.

Moreover, in order to simulate physiological or hypertensive
conditions, a tuning of the peripheral resistances is implemented.
In the considered example, where a relevant hypertension is
observed, resistances are increased by 40% to generate pressure
waveforms between about 90 and 140 mmHg. Values are generated by the model every 0.002 s whereas values used for the
estimation are those at time instants corresponding to the CTA
trigger, i.e., every 0.04 s.

Assuming each aortic segment i as a thin-walled circular tube,
having luminal radius ri and thickness hi , under the hypothesis
of cylindric vessel made up of isotropic linear elastic material
model described by Young modulus Ei , it is possible to derive
from the Laplace law the relation between ri and the internal
tube pressure Pi and the corresponding variation as follows:
dri =

C. Estimation of Aortic Stiffness
In this section, we describe two different approaches for the
estimation of the aortic stiffness at each cross section: 1) the
classical approach, in which only the maximum and the minimum values of arterial diameter and blood pressure over the
cardiac cycle are considered; 2) our probabilistic approach in
which the temporal evolution of both aortic blood pressure and
cross-sectional diameter is included.
1) Classical Literature Approach: local measures of aortic
stiffness are usually defined in terms of the maximum change in
cross-sectional diameter ΔDi = Di m ax − Di m in at section i
and the corresponding maximum change in blood pressure
ΔPi = Pi m ax−P i m in during the cardiac cycle at the same section. The so-called Peterson modulus [29] and Young modulus
[30] are the two stiffness indexes considered in this study. In this
paper, we consider the Young modulus E, which is defined as
the ratio between the stress increment Δσ and the strain increment Δε. Assuming the arterial wall as a thin-walled tubes and
following the Laplace law for thin-walled tubes subjected to an
internal pressure, the Young modulus Ei at section i assumes
the following form:
Δσi
ΔPi
E=
=
Δεi
2hi · ΔDi /Di2 m in

(1)

where hi is the thickness of the arterial wall at section i. It is
worth noting that the Young modulus is computed considering
each section independently.
2) Proposed Stochastic Approach: the procedure starts from
the assumption of a constitutive law between the aortic radius

ri2 (t)
dPi .
Ei hi − Pi (t)ri (t)

(2)

The quantities ri (t) and Pi (t) are state variables, whose values are provided by the noninvasive measurements. The term
Ei hi is the unknown quantity given by the product of two physical terms, i.e., the Young modulus Ei and the thickness hi .
Unfortunately, given the physics of the problem, it is not possible to separate the two contributions based on the observations
of ri (t) and Pi (t); to overcome such a limitation, we aim at
providing a probabilistic estimation of the term Ei hi ; once such
a term will be estimated, the Young modulus will be provided
assuming a given constant value of thickness.
For our purposes, we assume the term Ei hi at each section i as
a random quantity varying in time but having a constant expected
value at each time instant. For this reason, as highlighted by (3),
the term Ei hi is assumed as the sum of two terms: a constant
expected value [Ei hi ]0 and a Gaussian white noise ξiE (t) scaled
by a coefficient η which is the same for each section
Ei hi = [Ei hi ]0 + ηξiE (t).

(3)

The constitutive equation is then modified as follows:
ri2 (t)

dri = 
dPi .
[Ei hi ]0 + ηξiE (t) − Pi (t)ri (t)

(4)

Time t is discretized into discrete instants tj . Consequently,
the state variables are discretized into values ri,j = ri (tj ) and
white noise ξiE (t) follows a normal density with null mean value
and unitary variance, N (0, 1) and ξiE1 (t1 ) is independent of ξiE2 (t2 ) if i1 = i2
or t1 = t2 .

adopted in [Pa] for the estimation procedures.

where P̂i and r̂i denote the set of the observations for pressure
and radius at section i, respectively.
For the considered eight cross sections, the unknown parameters to be estimated are the products [Ei hi ]0 (with i = 1, . . . , 8)
and the error parameters η 2 , ε2 , and ψ 2 .
Following the Bayesian setting, the prior densities for such parameters are required. We assume a priori independence: among
all error parameters (η 2 , ε2 , and ψ 2 ), and between each parameter [Ei hi ]0 and the measurement errors (ε2 and ψ 2 ). Moreover,
all parameters [Ei hi ]0 are assumed conditionally independent
given η 2 .
Inverse Gamma densities are used for the errors
 
g η 2 = InvGamma (αη , βη )
 
g ε2 = InvGamma (αε , βε )
 
g ψ 2 = InvGamma (αψ , βψ )
(12)
where parameters α and β are the shape and scale factors of the
densities, respectively.
As for parameters [Ei hi ]0 , the joint prior densities
g([Ei hi ]0 |η 2 ) are factorized into g([Ei , hi ]0 , η 2 )g(η 2 ), and norare used

The choice for the prior densities and their parameters follows the configuration usually adopted in the literature [33].
Assuming a Young modulus of 0.4 MPa and a wall thickness of
2 mm, [Eh]prior
is set equal to 800 Pa·m. As for the shape and
0
scale factors of the errors, the following values are assumed:
αη = 0.125, βη = 0.1, αε = 0.01, βε = 0.01, αψ = 100, and
βψ = 10. These choices are such that the expected value of
g(η 2 ) is [Eh]prior
/10, the expected value of g(ε2 ) is 104 , and
0
the expected value of g(ψ 2 ) is 13·10−3 Pa2 /m2 . The idea is
to have the square errors of one order of magnitude lower than
the corresponding parameter or variable; only for pressure, the
same order is considered, due to the higher uncertainty coming from the adoption of standard waveforms coming from the
lumped parameter model. The entire statistical model is solved
numerically since an analytical derivation is not possible [32];
indeed, it has been implemented in JAGS [35].
D. Validation of the Approach
The proposed approach is validated using a numerical test
case as input data, where the true value of the stiffness to be
estimated is known. We choose a numerical test because of the
difficulty to get a “true” value with in vivo or in vitro tests; in
fact, the only way is to take a sample of the aortic wall from
the patient after the CTA measurements are acquired, but it is
clinically impossible to obtain such a sample in patients at the
moment the CTA is performed. Even in the case a patient dies
or undergoes a surgical intervention, the time elapsed between
the CTA images and the analysis of an aortic sample could be
associated with modifications in the stiffness.
The numerical test case is based on a finite element analysis
(FEA) performed using the commercial software Abaqus/STD

v12 (Simulia, USA). The analysis is performed under small
strain regime (NLGEOM=OFF), and it aims at computing the
radial enlargement of a straight cylinder with constant radius
clamped at both ends in axial direction. The cylinder is inflated
with an inner pressure ranging from 0 to ΔP , and the pressuretime curve resembles the typical shape of the aortic pressure in
a cardiac cycle. In particular, we assume a cylinder length of
160 mm, an initial radius of 13 mm, and a ΔP of 60 mmHg.
The cylinder thickness is assumed to be constant and equal to
2 mm. The FEA mesh is defined by 14 168 nodes and 14 080
S4 elements (4-node general-purpose shell, finite membrane
strains). We adopt a linear elastic model: the Poisson’s ratio ν is
fixed and equal to 0.33, whereas the Young modulus E and its
variation along the structure define the case under investigation.
In particular, we define two cases: 1) E is the same for the whole
model, 2) E varies along with the section.
For both cases, the simulation outputs, i.e., the radius variation
at eight sections combined with the pressure history, are used as
input for the Bayesian estimation.
The results of the statistical analysis, as depicted in Fig. 4,
show very good estimates. Expected values are very close to the
values used to generate the example and low standard deviations
are found.

In this section, we report the variation along the cardiac cycle
of both the aortic cross-sectional diameter (obtained through the
liberation of the CTA images) and the blood pressure (computed
through the lumped-parameter cardiovascular model). Given
this input data, we estimate the aortic stiffness at the level of
the different vessel cross sections, according to the classical
approach and the proposed probabilistic approach. It is worth
mentioning that to allow a fair comparison, the same input is
considered for both approaches; indeed, maximum and minimum values of radius and pressure for the classical approach
are those of the waveforms used for probabilistic one.
Fig. 7. Plot of Young modulus E i along the sections according to the classical
approach.

The Bayesian estimation has been also applied after modifying data with white noises. Indeed, a white noise scaled by a
coefficient has been added to each datum, where the coefficient
is equal to 10−5 m for each radius and 1 Pa for each pressure.
Such a choice allows to alterate the dataset while keeping a quite
linear trend between pressures and radii, as in the wall structure.
Results in Fig. 5 show that, for the first case, the true value is
within the credibility interval of one standard deviation, but in
one section where the credibility interval has to be extended at
1.1 standard deviations to always include the true value. For
the second case, the true value is within the credibility interval
of one standard deviation but in two sections, where the credibility intervals have to be extended at 1.3 standard deviations
to always include the true value. Thus, the approach is robust
enough to analyze the case.

A. Variation of Aortic Cross-Sectional Radius and Pressure
Along the Cardiac Cycle
The results of medical image elaboration, i.e., the temporal
variation of the aortic cross-sectional radius, are reported in
Table II. Then, the corresponding values of pressure obtained
from the lumped-parameter cardiovascular model are listed in
Table III. For both the tables, also the maximum and the minimum values along with the cardiac cycle are reported.
It is worth noting that the obtained pressure values are practically the same in each of the eight cross sections due to their
close proximity. Moreover, we remark that such values refer
to a hypertensive subject (+40% for all peripheral networks).
Finally, representative waveforms of both cross-sectional area
and blood pressure are shown in Fig. 6. Taking into account
the standard deviations 
 and ψ, the diameter and pressure data
provide a close positive relationship between the slope of the
diameter/pressure curve during the systole and the diastole, with
a consistent hysteresis loop.

III. RESULTS ON A CLINICAL CASE
We test the proposed method on a relevant clinical case, where
a variation of the stiffness along with the aorta is expected. In
this direction, the method is applied to a real patient who, as
described above, had an intense medical history, which includes
hypertension, repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm, and an
endovascular exclusion of a pseudoaneurysm. Clearly, the presence of a surgical graft and of an endovascular device may affect
the biomechanics of the aortic tree and the estimated stiffness.
First, the estimated stiffness refers to the entire structure of the
wall and it is not possible to separate the contribution of the vessel wall from that of the attached graft. Second, local alterations
of the pressure waveform that may occur cannot be acquired and
taken into account; this is an unavoidable limitation if we aim
at maintaining the procedure noninvasive. However, this issue
is negligible in our case since the graft is in the ascending aorta
and we are observing the descending one.

B. Estimation of Aortic Stiffness: Classical
Literature Approach
The aortic stiffness is computed at each cross section in terms
of the Young modulus E by (1), which is based on the minimum and maximum values of diameter and pressure, taken from
Tables II and III (diameter is twice the radius), respectively. As
for Ei , we assume h = 2 mm for each cross section. Results
are summarized in Table IV and plotted in Fig. 7. It is worth
noting that the peak values of stiffness correspond to the aortic
sections, where the pathological enlargement occurs.
C. Estimation of Aortic Stiffness: Proposed
Stochastic Approach
Estimates are obtained in JAGS [35] with 200 000 iterations,
a burn in period equal to 10 000, and a thinning interval equal

The obtained posterior densities are reported in Table V in
terms of expected value, standard deviations, and some quantiles of each posterior density. Higher expected values of [Ei hi ]0
than in the prior densities are observed, and nonnegligible errors

present in the system. The Young modulus is finally derived assuming a wall thickness of 2 mm for each section. The obtained
values are listed in Table VI plotted in Fig. 8.
In the Bayesian setting, the robustness of the estimates with
respect to the hypothesized data (i.e., the pressure waveforms) is
also evaluated. Indeed, the same analysis is repeated considering
pressure waveforms relative to a physiological subject, where
the 40% increase of the peripheral networks in the lumped parameter model is neglected. After assuming the same wall thickness of 2 mm for each section, the obtained Young moduli are

reported in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the obtained values are
only marginally influenced by a large variation of pressure levels (physiological waveforms are between 80 and 120 mmHg);

thus, the approach is robust enough to guarantee good results
even with a rough evaluation of hypertension level.
IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a noninvasive approach to estimate the aortic stiffness of a specific subject/patient and its
regional changes. The aortic stiffness is computed combining
cross-sectional radial enlargements of the aorta with the respective pressure waveforms, taking into account their entire trend
over the cardiac cycle. In particular, cross-sectional radii are
obtained elaborating CTA images, whereas pressures are simulated using a lumped parameter model to keep the method
noninvasive. Finally, the approach exploits a Bayesian stochastic estimation method to include the uncertainty of the input
variables, i.e., vessel radii and blood pressures.
First, we have verified the model prediction with respect to
a numerical toy-problem. Then, we have used the developed
framework to assess the regional changes of the descending
aorta stiffness in a real clinical case.
Results from the tests show fine estimations of the Young
moduli used to generate the numerical examples. Concerning
the clinical case, results obtained with the stochastic procedure
are compared with those from the classical literature approach,
in which only the minimum and maximum values of diameter
and blood pressure are considered. A similar trend of stiffness
along the aortic district is obtained, which evidences peak values
in the aortic sections where the pathological enlargement occurs.
In particular, the classical approach provides stiffness values a
little higher than the proposed stochastic approach in all sections
(with exception for the Section IV); the relative differences
between the stiffness values are plotted in Fig. 10. In addition,
the obtained stiffness values are comparable with the available
literature data [36]–[39].
The stochastic estimation has a general validity and supports
all possible waveforms. As a consequence, if a patient has a
particularly altered waveform, the proposed approach is able
to capture its peculiarities in contrast to the classical literature
approach. Moreover, the outcomes of the stochastic approach
are associated with a confidence interval, to take into account
the uncertainty deriving from the inlet variables of the estimation process. On the contrary, no information of the estimation
uncertainty is present in the classical literature approach. The
width of such a confidence interval gives information about the
robustness of the estimates and an idea of the possible error
committed in taking the expected value as estimated value. In
discriminating between a physiological or pathological condition, this is an important added value.
The proposed approach is powerful, but it requires the support of a model to generate the pressure waveforms. In this
paper, the profiles are generated using a standard lumped parameter model built on standard reference data. In particular,
both minimum and maximum pressure values are similarly increased with respect to the physiological profiles, to simulate
the effect of hypertension. Clearly, this could be a limit for certain pathologies with waveforms particularly altered. A future
work could be dedicated in personalizing the model, i.e., in
considering patient-specific parameters for such a model.

Moreover, it is worth underlining that we have estimated the
radial change of the aorta at each given section elaborating the
4-D CTA images under the simplifying assumption discussed
in Section II-A. More advanced methodologies can be used to
assess the movement of the aorta along the cardiac cycle, which
is certainly complex and 3-D [40], [41]. Furthermore, semiautomatic segmentation based on snake evaluation like ITK-SNAP
can certainly contain some noise due to manual stopping criteria.
This noise is limited in the case of lumen segmentation because
the forces deriving from the gradient jump at the lumen border limit the bubble expansion. However, further investigations
addressing the role of image noise and segmentation bias on
the final computation of lumen diameter variation could be performed. As for the adopted lumped parameter model, it accounts
for a very simple mathematical description of the blood flow and
its mechanical interactions with the vessel wall. For this reason,
such an approach may be not appropriate to describe the local
behavior in complex vascular geometries (such as bifurcations
and stenosis), which instead would require supplementary local modeling accounting for the solution of the Navier–Stokes
equation. However, such more sophisticated models may be
very computationally expensive, whereas the proposed method
appears to be faster and so more practical for its use into the
clinical practice.
Finally, the adopted constitutive equation refers to cylindrical
vessel, in which the radius does not vary along with the section.
This means that, when applied to cases in which a sudden variation is present, the movement of largest section could be slowed
by the neighboring ones and this could result in an overestimation of the stiffness. Future work will be done in considering
more complex kinematics and constitutive models to take into
account the 3-D structure of vessels with a nonconstant radius
increasing also the robustness of the approach.
The final objective of our paper is to support the adoption
of noninvasive techniques (such as CTA) in the clinical practice as a standard tool for large-scale diagnosis and treatment
planning of the aortic diseases. Indeed, the possibility of estimating the stiffness using noninvasive methods and a device
already present in several health care facilities makes the technique cheap and applicable to a large number of patients. For
a large-scale application, low computational times of the proposed methodology are fundamental: once the CTA images are
stored, they are processed in few minutes, and the outcomes
of the stochastic model are provided in few seconds. Also in
case a patient specific lumped parameter model is adopted, the
generation of ad hoc waveforms requires about a couple of minutes. Thus, the overall procedure can be easily automatized and
included in a tool.
The only limitation to the large-scale application is related
to the ionizing radiation of the CTA. In this direction, it is
worth noting that the number of CTA scans usually acquired
in a cardiac cycle is lower than 20 (usually eight scans) to
reduce the amount of radiation. Thus, our future aim will be
to investigate the effect of a reduction in the acquired CTA
images on the predictive capability of the method, and to determine a policy for distributing the reduced scans over the cardiac
cycle.
