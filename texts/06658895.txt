Abstract—System identification techniques have been used to
separate intrinsic muscular and reflexive contributions to joint
impedance, which is an essential step in the proper choice of patient specific treatment. These techniques are, however, only well
developed for linear systems. Assuming linearity prescribes the
neuromuscular system to be perturbed only around predefined operating points. In this study, we test the validity of a commonly
used linear model by analyzing the effects of flexion–extension displacement amplitude (2◦ , 4◦ , and 8◦ ) on damping, stiffness, and
reflex gain of the wrist joint, at different background torque levels
(0, 1, and 2 N·m). With displacement amplitude, intrinsic damping increased, while intrinsic stiffness and reflex gains decreased.
These changes were dependent on the level of wrist torque. The
dependency of the neuromuscular system properties on even small
variations in angular displacement is evident and has to be accounted for when comparing different studies and clinical interpretations using linear identification techniques. Knowledge of the
behavior of the neuromuscular system around operating points is
an essential step toward the development of nonlinear models that
allow for discrimination between patients and controls in a larger
range of loading conditions.

I. INTRODUCTION
HE dynamic relation between joint rotation and torque,
i.e., joint impedance, represents the resistance a joint applies to externally imposed rotation, and plays a key role in both
movement and postural control [1], [2]. Joint impedance has
been studied in normal and pathological cases (e.g., [3]–[7]) to
analyze underlying neuromuscular properties constituting joint
impedance. Research has shown that intrinsic and reflexive contributions to joint impedance can be discriminated between by

using high precision manipulators in combination with system
identification tools and models [8]–[11]. Existing identification
approaches assume linear behavior of the joint system, although
the neuromuscular system is known to be highly nonlinear. As a
consequence, the extent of intrinsic or reflexive contributions to
joint resistance will change with the system state. Several studies
investigated the variation of intrinsic and reflexive components
with changing joint angle [12]–[14], angular velocity [8], [15],
and displacement amplitude [13], [16], [17], in most cases combined with changes in background torque. Although aforementioned studies indicated changes in joint impedance with small
changes in displacement amplitude, effects on underlying neuromuscular properties have not yet been systematically assessed.
Several types of linear models of the neuromuscular system
have been proposed in the past. Intrinsic muscle properties have
been modeled as a damper and spring in parallel. Spinal reflex
pathway models representing the muscle spindles that feed back
muscle stretch and stretch rate [18], and Golgi Tendon Organs
that supply force-dependent feedback [19] are usually included
by linear state feedback gains. The effect of displacement amplitude on the type of reflexive pathway, i.e., force, velocity,
and/or position feedback, has not yet been investigated.
The goal of this study was to systematically investigate the
effect of displacement amplitude and level of background joint
torque on the contribution of intrinsic and reflexive components
to joint impedance in terms of damping, stiffness, and reflex
gain, after analysis of several feedback model structures. Measurements were to be controlled with high precision to ensure
only small deviations from chosen operating points. A linear
analysis method was used to reflect the nonlinear mechanisms
that contribute to joint impedance, without the need of assumptions on complex, nonlinear model structures. A two-step approach was used for the analysis. First, the optimal model structure was selected by testing different feedback models; second,
the change of intrinsic and reflexive properties with measurement condition was identified.

manipulator [20]. The setup consisted of a vertically positioned
electrical motor connected to a handle via a lever. The forearm
was fixated at the wrist and elbow joint and the hand was fixated
to the handle (see Fig. 1); details on the fixation are given in
van Eesbeek et al. [21]. The center of rotation of the wrist was
visually aligned to the motor axis. Joint angle was measured by
an encoder (Stegmann SRS50, accuracy 0.011◦ ) and torque was
measured by a custom-made force transducer integrated in the
lever (inaccuracy < 1 % full scale). Muscle activity of flexor
and extensor carpi radialis (FCR and ECR, respectively) was
measured using surface electromyography (EMG) electrodes
(Delsys Bagnoli-4, interelectrode distance 10 mm), online band
pass filtered (20–450 Hz), offline rectified and integrated by
low pass filtering (all signals) at 80 Hz, using a third-order
Butterworth filter. All signals were stored at 2000 Hz sample
frequency.
C. Measurement Protocol
Wrist joint properties were assessed using a series of
ramp-and-hold perturbations, switching between eccentric and
concentric loading, occurring at random time intervals. Nine
measurement conditions were applied: combinations of three
displacement amplitudes (2◦ , 4◦ , 8◦ ) at three flexion torque levels (0, 1, 2 N·m). All conditions were applied three times in
random order. The highest background torque level was chosen such that multiple consecutive runs were endurable. Cathers
et al. [22] encountered endurance issues above 35 % of MVC in
tests of similar intensity and duration. MVC was not measured
but earlier investigations on stroke patients indicated a level of
approximately 10 N·m [23]. The test was redone when subjects
experienced difficulty in maintaining the 2 N·m background
torque.
The wrist was displaced at constant rotation velocity of
3 rad/s. Displacement amplitude was then varied by changing the duration of displacement ramp. The resulting ramp
displacements were separated by hold periods of 200 ms or
more. Ramps were applied at random time intervals, based on
a pseudo-random binary sequence (see Fig. 2), similar as used
by Kearney et al. [8]. Each sequence lasted for 50 s, containing
between 42 and 51 stretches, depending on the amplitude (i.e.,
duration) of the ramp displacements. The first and last 5 s were

removed from the analysis to account for variable startup and
stopping behavior.
Torque was displayed to the subject as a moving trace in
time. High peak torques induced by the joint accelerations were
removed by low-pass filtering (2 Hz, second order). Subjects
were instructed to maintain a constant activation, i.e., keeping
the average (background) torque constant, without responding
to the variation caused by displacements. Average EMG, 100 to
50 ms prior to each ramp (i.e., base-level activation) was checked
for variation in cocontraction between conditions. Practice trials
were provided before the start of the actual experiment.

D. Modeling and Analysis
Three datasets of 50 s were obtained under equal conditions,
two of which were used for identification and one for validation.
A linear neuromechanical model from Schouten et al. [24], [25]
was adapted to account for the unidirectional sensitivity of the
velocity-dependent muscle spindle feedback pathway [26]–[28],
by using a half-wave rectifier (see Fig. 3).
The intrinsic component in the model represents damping B
and stiffness K from active muscle and passive tissue viscoelasticity. The reflexive feedback components contain a reflexive
gain (torque kf −E , velocity kv −E , or position kp−E dependent),

The model parameters were optimized using a nonlinear gradient optimization algorithm that minimized the least squares
error between the modeled torque and EMG and the measured
torque and EMG, respectively, using the following cost function:

a time delay td and a second-order filter to mimic muscle activation dynamics.
Extensor activity was monitored and appeared to be low
throughout this study, yielding negligible reflexive activity of
the extensors [17]. The unidirectional sensitivity of the velocitydependent muscle spindle was modeled as a one-way rectifier on
joint angular velocity, as proposed by Mirbagheri et al. [14]. Position and torque related feedback are directly related to relative
muscle length [26] and force [19], respectively, with bidirectional sensitivity. Muscle activation dynamics is represented by
a second-order filter, determined by two parameters; the eigenfrequency fa and a fixed relative damping at 0.75, where the
latter is based on the work of Genadry [29]

The parameters to be estimated were inertia I, damping B, stiffness K, position, velocity, and force reflex gains (kp−E , kv −E ,
and kf −E ), eigenfrequency of muscle activation dynamics fa ,
reflexive latency time td , and an EMG to torque scaling factor
kE −T . The product of activation dynamics Hact and kE −T describes the relationship between EMG and reflexively induced
torques. Average torque and EMG activity has been removed
before simulating the model. Seven combinations of reflexive
feedback gains were tested
1) kf −E + kv −E + kp−E ;
2) kf −E + kv −E ;
3) kf −E + kp−E ;
4) kv −E + kp−E ;
5) kf −E ;
6) kv −E ;
7) kp−E .
The product of the reflex gains with kE −T results in the
net reflex gain between input and torque, and is denoted
without the subscript E , e.g., kv −E [Vs/rad] · kE −T [N·m/V] =
kv [N·m·s/rad].

Here θ is the parameter vector, T is the measured torque, E the
measured flexor EMG, the hat indicates the modeled versions,
and (n, θ) is the prediction error. n is the individual sample
out of N samples. EMG was used to improve the parameter
optimization because reflex contributions to wrist torque were
small compared to the intrinsic contribution for the conditions
applied in this study. To prevent unequal contributions between
the torque and EMG errors, a constant factor c was used to
equally weigh the EMG error E and torque error T . The scaling value c was obtained from a condition that consistently
showed reflexive activity (2◦ displacement amplitude, 1 N·m
background torque condition), and consecutively used for all
other conditions. Another scaling factor was calculated for the
repeated dataset, again on the 2◦ , 1 N·m condition. Measured
joint angle was used as the model input.
All conditions were compared using the same length of data
before and after the ramp (100 ms before ramp displacement
onset up to 200 ms after ramp displacement). Eccentric and
concentric ramps were averaged, i.e., T (n) and E(n) in the
cost function consisted of two sets of averaged data; the average
torque or EMG during all eccentric and all concentric ramps.
All data cutting and averaging was done after model simulation
to prevent problems with changes in initial state values.
Although EMG is not necessary for model optimization (e.g.,
[7]), it was added for additional response shape and timing
information, therefore increasing sensitivity to model structure
selection and time delay td . Also, although less trustworthy
than the reflex contribution to torque [30], EMG magnitude was
considered as it subdivides the common reflex gain into two
parts, one of the neural pathway and one of muscle activation
(e.g., as mentioned before, kv −E · kE −T = kv ).
A difference in estimated parameters with measurement condition indicated nonlinear behavior. All computations were performed in MATLAB (The Mathworks).
E. Reflex Model Selection and Quality Measures
All combinations of feedback gains were tested for model
quality, determined by three outcome measures: 1) Variance
Accounted For (VAF∗ ) for goodness of fit of the model for
the validation data set; 2) normalized Standard Error of the
Mean (nSEM) for convergence of the parameter estimator; and
3) normalized InterTrial Variation (nITV) for consistency of
the estimator over repetitions. Each of these measures is described in more detail below. On the basis of these three quality
measures a single best model structure was chosen. This model

1008

was subsequently used to systematically assess the amplitudedependent change in intrinsic and reflexive contributions to joint
impedance.

where θ̂ is the optimized parameter vector. The signal means
were removed before VAF∗ calculation. When the VAF∗ equals
100%, each datapoint in the validation dataset would be exactly
described by the model. The difference between VAF and VAF∗
is related to the exogenous nonmodeled response, either due to
noise or varying subject performance. Furthermore, VAF generally increases with number of parameters, while VAF∗ will
decrease when the additional parameters are used to fit the exogenous part of the response. Therefore, an optimal number of
parameters can be found by maximizing the VAF∗ .
SEM values indicate the standard error of the estimated parameters in their optimal value [31]. High standard error values
represent low precision of estimation. SEM values were obtained from the diagonal of the estimated covariance matrix

where J is the Jacobian (matrix of partial derivatives of the prediction error () to each parameter). The SEM for each parameter
was averaged over two observations.
The ITV parameter equals the estimated variance of the estimated model parameters over the first two observations

where subscript i indicates the ith element and s refers to the
applied dataset. ITV values represent the variation over repetitions, mainly determined by consistency of the estimator, but
may also include variance from changes in subject performance.
For comparison of model structures, containing a different
amount of parameters, both SEM and ITV values were normalized using the average estimated parameter vector (determined
on each separate model structure, averaged over all conditions),
referred to as nSEM and nITV.
The three quality measures were complementary. The nSEM
indicates that the parameter fulfilled a distinct role in the optimization while the VAF∗ indicates the quality of the model
as a whole in describing the observed behavior. These two parameters are sufficient for model structure selection. The nITV
measure supports the other two and indicates whether the parameters that were estimated on one observation were different
from those estimated on another one.

F. Additional Contribution of Reflexive Pathway
Reliability of the activation dynamics parameters depends on
the presence of reflexively induced torques. Therefore, the average absolute torque originating from the reflexive pathway was
expressed as a percentage of average absolute intrinsic torque,
both determined in the optimization time window (100 ms prior
to ramp onset up to 200 ms after the ramp). The resulting parameter (RC [%]) indicates the reflexive contribution to the model.
G. Statistical Analysis
All outcome parameters were tested for having a normal distribution, using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Parameters were
averaged over repetition as no significant effect of trial could be
established by paired t-test. Different model structures were
tested for significant differences in quality measures VAF∗ ,
nSEM, and nITV, using nonparametric Friedman testing. For
the final model, dependency on measurement condition of model
outcome parameters inertia I, damping B, stiffness K, EMGbased reflex gain kv −E , EMG-torque gain kE −T , reflex gain kv ,
reflex latency time td , eigenfrequency of activation dynamics
fa , and reflexive contribution to joint torque RC were assessed
using a general linear model ANOVA, taking repeated measurements into account. The ANOVA has two degrees of freedom
for the individual amplitude and torque effects, and 4 for Amp
× Tor effects. When sphericity could not be assumed according
to Mauchly’s test of sphericity, p-values were adjusted using
Greenhouse–Geisser. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 19.
III. RESULTS
The relative increase in base-level activity with respect to rest
conditions was, for the FCR muscle, on average six times larger
than the ECR muscle. Therefore, cocontraction was assumed to
be low.
A. Reflex Model Selection
Model structures had a significant effect on VAF∗ , nSEM,
and nITV (p < 0.0005, see Fig. 4). The model using velocity
kv feedback only was ranked highest from Friedman testing
and resulted in a higher VAF∗ compared to the kp ,kf ,kf +
kp ,kf + kv , and kp + kv + kf model structures (p < 0.032), but
not higher than the combined position and velocity (kp + kv )
feedback, which did not significantly differ in VAF∗ (p = 0.705).
Changes in reflexive model structure only had a minor effect
on VAF∗ due to the low reflexive contribution to joint torque
(RC). Although variations in VAF∗ were small, differences are
significant due to the amount of observations (each boxplot is
based on 63 observations = 9 conditions, 7 subjects).
Adding position feedback to velocity feedback resulted in a
higher nSEM and no significant changes in nITV (p = 0.017 and
p = 0.166, respectively). Thus, mostly due to the lack of increase
in VAF∗ for other models, the best model structure included
only a velocity feedback gain kv . This model was additionally
compared for changes in VAF∗ , nSEM, and nITV over all background torque and amplitude conditions (see Fig. 5). For those

this subject. The VAF for this model (parameters estimated on this set) was
98.36 %, the reflexive contribution RC 10.9 %.

conditions where the model decreased in quality (e.g., higher
nSEM for higher background torques), none of the other model
structures showed an apparent improvement. It could therefore
be assumed that, within our set of models and conditions, the kv
model structure was not only best on average, but also in each
individual measurement condition.
Parameter estimation using the velocity feedback model resulted in VAF values of 96.5% (s.d. 1.9%) over all conditions
and subjects, indicating that the model captured the major part
of the system dynamics. High experiment repeatability was supported by comparable values for the validation dataset, yielding
VAF∗ values of 95.6% (s.d. 2.0%). An example of a model fit
is shown in Fig. 6. The reflexive contribution was found to increase with background torque and depending on background
torque also on displacement amplitude (see RC in Table I and
Fig. 7).

boxes indicate better values.

Variation of parameters with condition is shown in Fig. 7.
Table I summarizes the statistical results. Inertia did not change
with condition, as expected. Damping increased with displacement amplitude, but not with background torque. Intrinsic stiffness decreased with displacement amplitude and increased with
background torque.

STATISTICAL RESULTS

The velocity-dependent feedback gain kv −E decreased with
displacement amplitude and increased with background torque.
The other reflexive parameters (i.e., time delay td , muscle activation dynamics eigenfrequency fa , and EMG-force gain kE −T ),
were tested only for nonzero background torques as estimation
in the rest condition was unreliable, due to low reflexive activity.
td , fa , and kE −T all significantly changed with displacement
amplitude (see Fig. 7, Table I). Only fa changed (decreased)
with background torque. The reflex gain between EMG and
torque kv did not share the same amplitude dependency as kv −E
as it was multiplied with an opposing effect from kE −T . kv did
increase with background torque.

IV. DISCUSSION
The reflexive contribution to human wrist impedance was
best described by a linear gain on stretch velocity. Although
the reflexive contributions were small in magnitude compared
to the intrinsic contributions, they were consistently estimated
and resulted in an increased accuracy of the model (see RC in
Fig. 7).
Intrinsic parameters were of the same order of magnitude as
found in the literature; Formica et al. [32] found values for stiffness in rest at approximately 0.9 N·m/rad. Gielen and Houk [33]
found stiffness and viscosity in rest values of approximately
0.08 N/mm and 0.004 N·s/mm, respectively (with an 8 cm moment arm this is roughly 0.5 N·m/rad and 0.026 N·m·s/rad).
Intrinsic and reflexive properties changed significantly with
background torque, as expected, but also changed with joint
displacements. The change in parameters was well explained
from system states, as indicated by the high VAF∗ . We therefore describe the system as nonlinear. The nonlinear behavior
of the neuromuscular system at small angular displacements is
important to consider when interpreting results from linear system identification methods. Small differences in operating point
will alter estimated linear model parameters, but as shown in
this paper, in a physiologically predictable way.

A. Model Structure
A model containing velocity feedback only was chosen on
the basis of a high VAF∗ . Velocity feedback was also applied by
Kearney et al. [34] who used similar perturbations. nSEM and
nITV values supported the model as no other model structures
resulted in lower values of these measures.
All model structures including kf −E resulted in a reduced
VAF∗ because the intrinsic muscle properties are part of the force
feedback loop and therefore intrinsic stiffness and damping parameters were likely optimized to resemble velocity feedback
behavior.
The model combining velocity-dependent feedback with position feedback gave comparable results. The lack of increase
in VAF∗ for this model indicated that the additional parameter
kp−E was superfluous as the estimated kp−E values remained
very small.
Earlier studies using wide-bandwidth multisine force perturbations have found substantial contributions from force and
position feedback while subjects performed more challenging
force or position control tasks [35]. Differences between multisine and transient perturbations on neuromuscular properties
will be studied in future work.
Reflexive parameters kE −T , td , and fa were unreliable for
the 0 Nm condition because reflexive activity, as indicated by
kv , was negligible. Fig. 7 showed that the parameters kE −T , td ,
and fa remained at their initial values for the rest condition.
B. Stiffness
The increase in wrist stiffness with muscle activation is
known to be caused by an increase in the number of cross
bridges [9], [12], [36]. The cause of the decrease in stiffness
with displacement amplitude is less clear. Intrinsic resistance
during the initial phase of movement is expected to be governed by short range stiffness [21], [37]–[39]. During short
duration stretches, the stiffness that muscles provide largely
originates from cross bridges in attached state. When stretch
commences, cross bridges likely resume into turn-over behavior, exhibiting a lower stiffness. This may explain the observed
reduction in intrinsic stiffness (see Fig. 7). The reduction in
stiffness with displacement amplitude was also found in earlier
research [15]–[17], [40]–[42]. However, short range stiffness
would influence the observed joint torques during a relatively
small time span; i.e., approximately 30 ms of the stretch [21].
The 100 and 200 ms hold periods before and after stretch had
a temporally dominant influence on the estimated stiffness parameter compared to the relatively short 22, 33 or 57 ms ramp
durations. Alternative hypotheses for the decrease in stiffness
with displacement amplitude are 1) the force–length relationship of the muscle [43], [44], 2) changes in FCR moment arm,
and/or 3) stretch induced force enhancement [45], which are
dealt with in the following list.
1) Positive stiffness values indicate that muscles operated on
the ascending limb of the length–tension relationship (in
concordance with Loren [46] for the FCR). The decrease in
stiffness with displacement amplitude would then suggest
the FCR operated close to its optimal length where the

requested background torque (2◦ , 4◦ , and 8◦ , light green to black, left to right). The black horizontal dashed lines, when shown, indicate upper or lower bounds for
the parameters. When upper or lower bounds coincide with axes limits, the line is still visible (such as the lower bound on damping B placed at zero).

force increments with further muscle lengthening would
become smaller. This seems unlikely for all seven subjects.
2) The moment arm of the FCR was found to increase (linearly) in the measured range [46], therefore potentially
increasing observed stiffness.
3) The muscle force resulting from force enhancement is
known to increase with displacement amplitude. Whereas
some report a linear increase [47], [48], others have found
a reduction in the increase with amplitude [45], [49], [50],
which may well explain the observed decrease.
The observed decrease in stiffness with displacement amplitude could therefore be explained by force enhancement. Also,

in the work of Bullimore [49], a slow force change can be
seen, starting directly after stretch. This response is too slow to
identify within our 200 ms time window after stretch, yet the
unknown physiological structure that causes this response may
contribute to the observed change in stiffness with displacement
amplitude.
Amplitude and background torque variations were shown to
have an opposite effect on stiffness. Although the physiological
background is entirely different, the 1 N·m background torque,
2◦ displacement amplitude measurement condition will result
in a similar stiffness to the 2 N·m, 8◦ condition (see Fig. 7, top
right panel).

1012

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL. 61, NO. 4, APRIL 2014

C. Damping
The increase in damping, observed with amplitude for
nonzero voluntary background torque, can be explained by the
increase in the amount of cross bridges resuming into cyclic
turnover after being stretched beyond their short range elastic
limit, resulting in viscous-like behavior. In contrast with stiffness, the damping parameter will only be determined during the
(nonzero velocity) ramp period, such that cross-bridge dynamics and short range stiffness will have a larger effect. Given the
elastic limit of muscles, it is likely that intrinsic damping progressively contributes to joint torque with displacement amplitude exceeding the elastic limit. To our knowledge this increase
in damping with displacement amplitude has not been shown
before. However, several studies [16], [40] showed that damping
decreased with displacement amplitude, but in contrast to our
study, in these studies the displacement velocity was increased
together with amplitude.
It was expected that intrinsic damping increases with background torque [9], [12], [51]. This increase with background
torque was however only visible for the largest displacement
amplitude conditions. It was hypothesized that for the smaller
displacement amplitudes cross-bridge related viscosity was low
because the response was governed by short range stiffness,
which accounted for approximately 30 ms of the response. Ford
et al. [52] have shown that cross-bridge resistance to small amplitude displacements can be modeled by a stiffness component
only.
D. Reflex Gain
We observed an increase of velocity-dependent reflex gain
kv −E with background torque (see Fig. 7), a well-known phenomenon which may originate from increased motor neuron
pool sensitivity, presynaptic inhibition, and/or an increased
alpha–gamma coactivation [53]. The gain between displacement
velocity and torque kv also increased with background torque
level, which was previously observed by Carter et al. [15] on
the first dorsal interosseus muscle (index finger), who found an
increase in reflexive stiffness with a background torque change
from 0.05 to 0.25 N·m (10–50 % MVC). Zhang and Rymer [9]
showed an increase in reflex gains for the elbow, up to approximately 10 N·m (40 % MVC), and a decrease on some occasions
for larger background torque levels. Mirbagheri et al. [14] observed this drop in reflex gain for higher background torques
(>3 N·m) around the ankle, but found a constant gain between
displacement and EMG for these background torque levels. The
increase of the estimated reflex gain with background torque
in this study is consistent with the results from the upper limb.
However, nonlinearity of joint characteristics further reduces
validity of parameter comparisons between different joints.
The estimated reflex gain kv −E decreased significantly with
displacement amplitude. Although EMG magnitude is known to
increase with displacement amplitude [54], [55], this increase is
not proportional to displacement amplitude. The displacementEMG gain decrease is a well-known property of the reflexive
pathway [13], [56]–[59] and can be related to high spindle sensitivity to stretch onset. The study of Sinkjaer et al. [17] supported

this decrease in reflex gain between displacement and torque for
small displacement amplitudes (1◦ to 2◦ ), but found a transition
to increased gains for larger movements between 4◦ to 7◦ , very
much in line with the observed changes in kv (see Fig. 7). Our
obtained reflex gain values are in a much lower range, although
not directly comparable as the study by Sinkjaer et al. [17] was
conducted on the ankle joint. However, the reflexive response
as given in their article (see Fig. 6 A), is shaped very similarly.
It is expected that the reflexive contribution (RC), in percent,
will lie in a similar range. The decrease in kv −E may be largely
explained from a shortcoming of the linear model in describing
the period of low reflexive activity after M1 [30]. This decrease
in kv −E was not observed in kv due to the compensating muscle
activation dynamics filter, characterized by both kE −T and fa .
E. Muscle Activation Dynamics
No literature was found regarding the dependency of muscle
activation dynamics on displacement amplitude. Both the muscle activation eigenfrequency fa and gain kE −T increased with
displacement amplitude. Although part of the change in kE −T
may be compensatory behavior for the mismatch between linear
reflex gain kv −E and the nonlinear reflex response, the change
in both eigenfrequency fa and gain kE −T is in line with the
size principle [60]. The size principle states that with increasing
neural drive more fast-twitch fibers are recruited and sensitivity
to neural input of the muscle increases. Therefore, for longer afferent input, the muscle would activate faster (fa ) and relatively
more (kE −T ).
The muscle activation gain kE −T did not change with background torque for nonzero background torques, similar to findings by Genadry et al. [29] on the triceps surae. Genadry et al.
also found no structural change of the eigenfrequency fa of activation dynamics with background torque. The eigenfrequency
of muscle activation dynamics was estimated in a similar range
around 1 Hz.
F. Time-Varying Properties
As the duration of the hold phase preceding each ramp was
of a different length, the wrist may have responded differently
to each ramp as a result of some time-varying property (i.e., unmodeled dynamics). An effect of such a time-varying property
might even be modulated by the controlled conditions (amplitude and/or torque). Muscle activation dynamics, including fa
and particularly kE −T are expected to be sensitive to historical events. Since we averaged all ramp and hold displacements
and responses in the analysis, the obtained parameters reflect
average system behavior. Therefore, we may say that, for the
given averaged conditions, the system is nonlinear, but not timevariant, as indicated by high VAF∗ values.
G. General
The use of linear techniques allowed us to systematically
identify nonlinear joint neuromechanics. The observed parameter variations with displacement amplitude and background torque could be explained from physiological nonlinear
mechanisms known from the literature. Knowledge of the link

KLOMP et al.: PERTURBATION AMPLITUDE AFFECTS LINEARLY ESTIMATED NEUROMECHANICAL WRIST JOINT PROPERTIES

between the observed parameter variation and underlying physiology can be used for physiological differentiation between
patients and controls. Nonlinearity should be accounted for in
the (clinical) interpretation of linearly estimated intrinsic and
reflexive contributors to joint resistance.
For the investigated small angular displacements, the possible
nonlinearities that determine joint behavior are force enhancement, muscle short range stiffness, high spindle sensitivity to
stretch onset, and the size principle of motor unit recruitment.
A next step is to connect the now identified operating points using nonlinear physiological models, such that measurement and
identification over a larger functional domain is possible using a
single model, i.e., disregarding linearization requirements. Development of such a nonlinear model requires the investigation
of additional measurement conditions, such as angular velocity,
interstimulus interval, and the combinations of these conditions,
which is currently studied by our group.
V. CONCLUSION
The reflexive contribution to human wrist impedance was well
described by a reflexive pathway model consisting of only velocity dependence. Reflexive contributions were small compared to
the intrinsic contributions, but were consistently estimated and
resulted in a significant increase in quality of our linear model.
Intrinsic and reflexive properties change with amplitude of
small joint displacement, and depend on background torque,
emerging from nonlinear physiological properties on the neural
and muscular level. The applied linear approach is an initial step
toward describing the nonlinear behavior of joint impedance
throughout a functional range of multiple operating points,
which is essential in understanding treatment and follow-up
of neuromechanical disorders.
