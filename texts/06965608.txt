Abstract—Microwave-induced thermoacoustic tomography
(MITAT) is a hybrid method which constructs images with
ultrasound spatial resolution while exploiting dielectric contrast at
microwave frequency. It has great potential in biomedical imaging
especially in early breast cancer detection. The detection of early
stage breast tumor in MITAT is challenged by the moderate
endogenous dielectric contrast between malignant and healthy
glandular tissues. In order to overcome this limitation, the performance of using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as an imaging contrast
enhancement agent is evaluated. First, the influences in dielectric
and acoustic properties caused by CNTs are measured. Second,
based on the measurements and the published data, numerical
breast phantom is created and then used to explore the contrast
enhancing effect of CNTs for MITAT, by an integrated simulation
approach in both electromagnetic and acoustic field. With an
experimental MITAT system, the thermoacoustic responses of
tissue mimicking materials with different CNTs concentrations
are also quantitatively investigated. Finally, the effectiveness of the
contrast agent is also validated experimentally by using a MITAT
system. The results show that the using of the dielectric contrast
agent can effectively enhance the contrast of the MITAT image.
Index Terms—Breast tumor detection, carbon nanotubes, contrast agent, thermoacoustic imaging.

has great potential in early cancer detection, especially in early
breast cancer detection. Microwave frequency dielectric contrast
between the malignant and normal tissue is the fundamental of
the thermoacoustic imaging (TAI). The malignant tissue with
higher dielectric loss than the normal tissue absorbs more microwave energy and generates stronger TA signals. According
to [3], the microwave frequency dielectric contrast between the
malignant tissues and normal adipose tissues is as large as 10:1.
However, the contrast between malignant tissues and normal
breast glandular tissues is no more than 10% [3]. Breast tumors
often originate in the ducts or lobules of the breast, which are
glandular tissues [4]. This low contrast limits the sensitivity of
MI which directly depends on the dielectric properties. Meanwhile, TAI is also limited by this low contrast due to the TA
signals are related with the microwave frequency properties of
the tissues.
Aiming to overcome the limitation due to the low contrast
in dielectric properties between the malignant and normal glandular tissues, some contrast enhancing agents have been deeply
studied. For example, Alireza et al. report the effects of microbubbles on simple TA targets [4]. Fe3 O4 /polyaniline (PANI)
is used as a contrast agent in TA molecular tomography [5].
Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) are adopted to enhance the breast
cancer imaging [6]–[8]. Additionally, MNP is also adopted to
enhance the image contrast in an ultra-wideband microwave
radar system for breast imaging [9]. Based on the contrast
agents used in MI, a new approach to detect cancerous tissues
at low signal-to-noise ratios in an interference-prone biological
medium is presented by Chen and Kosmas [10]. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-based contrast agents also show their promise for
biomedical applications, such as molecular imaging in magnetic
resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, nuclear, microwave, photo-acoustic and ultrasound, etc., [11]–[16]. These
literatures provide the basis for adopting CNTs to enhance the
contrast in MITAT. CNTs may also be advantageous in MITAT
modality because of the high microwave absorption.
In this paper, we deeply evaluated the idea and the performance of using multiwalls carbon nanotubes as a dielectric
contrast agent for enhancing the contrast of the MITAT, by
both numerical simulation and experimental measurements.
Exogenous particles, which are superficially functionalized
with targeting ligands, are passively accumulated via an
enhanced permeability and retention effect in tumor vasculature
[17]. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the TA response of a

tumor infused with CNTs will be not only stronger than that
of the tumor in its precontrast-agent stage but also provides
increased contrast with surrounding normal glandular tissues
infused with less or none CNTs accumulations.
As an initial step toward evaluating the feasibility of CNTs as
a contrast agent in MITAT, the dielectric properties of different
concentrations of CNTs are measured at 1–15 GHz microwave
frequency band. Meanwhile, the effect of CNTs on acoustic velocity is also explored. Combining the measured results with
the reported data of tissue properties with CNTs, a numerical
breast model is established. An integrated simulation approach
[18] including microwave field and acoustic field is performed
to verify the imaging contrast enhancement. To better evaluate
the performance of CNTs, tissue mimicking materials with different concentrations of CNTs are made and tested in a MITAT
experimental system, corresponding with the simulation results
to evaluate the imaging contrast enhancement caused by CNTs.
The simulation and experimental results show that the CNTs can
efficiently enhance the image contrast in MITAT. The images
indicate that the low CNTs concentration as small as 0.22% can
increase the image contrast by about 26%.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Some
basic theories and methods about MITAT are presented in
Section II. The influences to dielectric and acoustic properties
are measured and discussed in Section III. In addition, simulation and experimental results are also given in Section III to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the dielectric contrast agent for
MITAT. Conclusions are drawn in the final section.
II. THEORY AND METHODS

Different dielectric properties of tumors and normal tissues
are the foundation for imaging with MITAT. TA waves, induced
by local heat deposition due to the microwave absorption, can
be described via the TA wave equation, i.e.

which is a function of total conductivity σeﬀ and electrical
 inside the tissue. The total conductivity mainly includes
field E
the ionic conductivity and the equivalent conductivity due to
the dielectric loss. Assuming the electrical field is uniform inside the breast in a TAI system, the absorption of microwave
energy by tissues can be characterized by the total conductivity
of the tissue. Therefore, it can be concluded that the tissue with
high conductivity can be detected because of the stronger TA
signals caused by high heating response. In consideration of the
low contrast in dielectric property between tumor and normal
glandular tissue, a contrast agent with high electric conductivity
could help to overcome this limitation.
Due to the high electric conductivity, CNTs have been explored to enhance the microwave absorption of the cancer tissue
in MI [14]. Beside the high conductivity, CNTs also has some
other unique physical properties such as ultra-light weight and
high Young modulus. With these special properties, CNTs have
great potential to be proposed as a contrast agent in MITAT.

The dielectric properties of different breast tissue have been
reported by Lazebnik [3] and the mathematical models for
dielectric properties which well fit the measurements are established. For evaluating the microwave absorption of breast
tissue, the total conductivity [1] is adopted and it can be calculated by

function, vs is the sound speed, C is the specific heat capacity

as the relative volume change with temperature under constant
pressure [19]–[21].
Assuming the source position and the observation position

Equation (2) indicates that the TA signal directly depends
on the heating function. According to [14], the CNTs can effectively enhance the heating responses of tissue mimicking
materials. Therefore, it can be predicated that the increment in
heating function will lead to a larger TA signal for the tumor tissue infused with CNTs. Under thermal stress confinement, the

adipose tissue, transitional tissue between fat and gland, glandular tissue and chest wall muscle tissue. The sketch of breast
phantom is shown in Fig. 1 . The radius of hemispheric phantom is 41 mm. The thicknesses of adipose and transition tissues
are 15 and 7 mm, respectively. According to the UWCEM numerical breast phantom repository [23], the glandular tissue is
modeled in the center of the breast phantom. The radius of glandular tissue is 18 mm. In order to validate the performance of
contrast agent, two tumors with 5-mm radius are set in the glandular tissue. According to [14] and [22], Tumor 2 is modeled
with 0.22% concentration CNTs.
Refer to [22], the parameters of the Debye model for different
tissues are listed in Table I.
The Debye model is established to fit the measured wide-band
frequency-dependent dielectric properties. Therefore, based on
(6), (7) and Table I, the dielectric properties of the different
breast tissues in a specific frequency can be calculated. Considering the approximation of Debye model, the effective conductivities of tissue mimicking samples are also experimentally
measured, based on the transmission reflection method [24] in
Section III-A. In order to keep the consistency between the
imaging simulations and experiments, the parameters which
are respectively obtained by Debye model and sample measurements are combined as the simulation dielectric properties,
shown in Table II. It is worth noting that the dielectric properties
of Tumor 1 and Tumor 2 are corresponding to those of no CNTs
and 0.22% (2.25 mg/mL) CNTs concentrations.
The acoustic properties of the biology tissue are another key
issue in MITAT. The acoustic properties of the biology tissue,
such as the distribution of the acoustic velocities, directly determine the quality of the reconstructed image. For instance,
acoustic velocity variations can cause displacements of TA sig-

nals both axially and tangentially [25]. Though the acoustic
heterogeneities in breast are weak [26], the breast tissues still
have different acoustic properties. Thus, the breast phantom is
modeled with different acoustic properties in order to be much
closer to the reality.
According to [27], the acoustic velocities of the adipose and
skin tissues are modeled with mean acoustic velocities of 1470
and 1537 m/s. The acoustic speeds of glandular and transitional
tissues are established with 1540 and 1490 m/s, respectively. The
acoustic velocities are all set to Gaussian random variables with
a standard deviation of 5. The density of the tissues are selected
as ρ = 0.843 · vs − 349, which is a relation derived from the
measured properties of soft tissues [28]. With this acoustic setup,
the reflection and refraction occurred in the breast tissues are
taken into account. The dielectric and acoustic properties of the
different tissues in the numerical breast are listed in Table II.
C. Finite Integration Time Domain (FITD) and K-Space
Pseudospectral (PS) Method
Since the multiple physical characters in MITAT, an integrated simulation approach which combines FITD method and
k-space PS method is adopted to simulate the whole procedure
in MITAT.
FITD method is an efficient numerical method in analyzing
electromagnetic (EM) problem [19]. It is a consistent discretization scheme for Maxwell’s equations in their integral form [29].
This discrete EM field approach can be used for efficient numerical simulations with stability in the time domain. The PS
method, which is an extension of finite difference method, can
reduce the grid points per wavelength [30], [31] and k-space
approach can help to overcome the requirement for small timestep [32], [33]. By using k-space PS method, the procedures
of TA propagation and image reconstruction can be efficiently
simulated.
The simulation flow chart of MITAT is shown in Fig. 2. FITD
method is adopted to solve the heating function in (1) and the
following acoustic simulation is performed with k-space PS
solution.
In FITD frame, a microwave pulse is radiated to the breast
phantom and the electric fields inside the phantom can be obtained. According to the electric fields, the heating function in
the breast model can be effectively calculated. Based on (1) and
(2), the initial TA source can be obtained.
After the initial TA pressure distribution in the breast is obtained, the propagation of TA wave is performed within the

k-space PS frame. A MATLAB toolbox, named k-wave, is designed to simulate the photo-acoustic propagation and image
reconstruction based on the k-space PS method [30]. In this paper, the k-wave toolbox is extended to simulate the microwave
induced TA fields. By using this toolbox, the TA propagations
in the breast phantom and coupling medium are simulated and
the TA signals are received by the transducer array that is immersed in the coupling medium. With the TA signals received
by transducer array, TA image can be reconstructed.
D. MITAT Model and Real Imaging System
A numerical model corresponding to a real MITAT system is
established. The performance of contrast enhancement by CNTs
is evaluated by both numerical simulations and experiments.
In numerical simulation, a cylindrical container filled with
coupling medium (mineral oil) is placed above a microwave antenna. The diameter of the container is 168 mm. By using FITD
method, the microwave radiation components of MITAT system can be accurately simulated. Moreover, the influence to the
microwave radiation caused by acoustic components such as ultrasound transducers, scanning container and coupling medium
can also be simulated efficiently. The setup of the simulation is
shown in Fig. 3.
The TA waves are received by a circular array of ultrasound
transducers aligned on the wall of the container. In this model,
the container, the mineral oil, and the transducers are all taken
into account. In addition, the sizes and shapes of the components
in the simulation are the same with the real experimental devices.
In the experimental system, the array of receivers are realized
by rotating four transducers to form a synthesized array. The system controller controls the motor to drive the scanning container
to rotate each scanning step. Afterwards, the trigger pulses are
sent from the system controller to trigger the microwave modulator and the data acquisition card. The irradiated microwave
from the radiator illuminates on the tissue in the container and
TA signals will be emitted. The TA signals are amplified by a
54-dB preamplifier (Olympus, 5662). Then the TA signals are
sampled with 7.5-MHz sampling rate after 20 times averaging.
After finish all the scanning procedures, digital TA signals are
processed to reconstruct an image. All the scanning procedures
with 1.8◦ step can be finished within two minutes. More details
about the system can be found in [34]–[36].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. Dielectric and Acoustic Properties Influenced by CNTs
It is important to emphasize that the effective conductivity
is utilized to evaluate the microwave absorption in MITAT, as
described in Section II-A. Therefore, the influence on effective
conductivity by CNTs is mainly discussed in this section.
Based on a dielectric measurement system [24], the dielectric
properties of the tissue mimicking materials with various weight
concentrations of CNTs over a frequency range of 1–15 GHz
are characterized. Transmission reflection method is a relatively
simple method with high accuracy among the various measuring methods. Some basic details about the dielectric measuring
system used in this manuscript can be found in [24]. It should
be emphasized that the system used in this paper is an improved
version with expanded measuring frequency range. In the experiment, tissue mimicking materials made of agar, salt and distilled
water, etc., [37] are adopted. CNTs which act as the contrastenhanced agent are added to the tissue mimicking material when
the tissue mimicking material is made. The percent-by-weight
concentrations of CNTs in the samples are 0.22%, 0.5%, and
1%, respectively. Their corresponding volume ratios are 2.25,
5.15 and 10.30 mg/mL. For the reference, a sample of tissue
mimicking material with no CNTs is also used to perform the
experiment. The measured effective conductivities are shown in
Fig. 4.
Each wide-band curve represents the effective conductivity
of the sample with the same CNTs concentration. From the
curves of the conductivity, it can be seen that the conductivities increase along with the frequency rising. Meanwhile, the
measured data show that the conductivity is proportional to the
CNTs concentration.
The effective conductivity is the main parameter that affects the interaction between microwave and biological tissue in
MITAT. According to (4), the heating function is determined
by the total conductivity of tissue in the TA effect. Table III

summarizes the effective conductivities of the different tissue
mimicking materials at multiple frequencies which have been
adopted in MITAT [26]. From the tabular data, it can be seen
that the conductivity increments caused by CNTs are obvious
even if the concentrations are as small as 1%. For instance, the
conductivity can be enhanced by about 33% at 2.45 GHz.
Afterwards, the acoustic velocities of the tissue mimicking
materials with or without carbon nanotubes are measured. The
velocity of the sample is determined by cs = Dcw /(D − cw Δt)
where cs is the velocity in the sample, D is the thickness of
the sample, cw is the velocity in the water and Δt is the time
shifting [4]. In order to assure the accuracy, multiple samples
with different thicknesses are adopted in the measurements. In
the experiments, the acoustic velocity in the water is measured
as 1489 m/s (20 ◦ C). The measured velocities of the samples
with different CNTs concentrations are shown in Fig. 5 .
From the histogram, it is observed that the acoustic velocities
of samples increase along with the rising CNTs concentration.
The acoustic velocities of four kinds of samples are 1473.3,
1478.9, 1483.6 and 1488.6 m/s, respectively. This tendency is
determined by the unique elastic property of CNTs that is the
very high Young modulus and the low mass density [38].
B. Numerical Imaging Result
In this section, the performance of contrast agent is further
demonstrated according to the MITAT images. The numerical
breast phantom described in Fig. 1 is used to perform the simulation. In the breast phantom, two tumors labeled as Tumor 1
and Tumor 2 are modeled in the glandular layer. The diameter
of the tumors is 5 mm and the distance between the tumors is

Fig. 6.

SAR distribution in breast phantom.

6 mm. Tumor 1 is set without contrast agent, while Tumor 2 is
modeled with contrast agent.
First, the microwave absorptions of the tumors are investigated. In the simulation, the influences of other breast tissues
like skin, fatty tissue, transitional tissue, glandular tissue and
muscle in the chest wall are also taken into account. This setup
makes the simulation closer to real condition. Specific absorption rate (SAR) is adopted to measure the microwave absorption. The SAR distribution of the interested horizontal slice at
2.45 GHz is shown in Fig. 6. From the SAR distribution, it
can be seen that Tumor 1 is hard to be distinguished from the
around glandular tissue. On the contrary, Tumor 2 has stronger
microwave absorption than that of the glandular tissue.
TAI for the two tumors is simulated to validate this conclusion further. In order to construct the quantitative TA image of
the tumors, TA signals exclusively contributed by the tumors are
desired. According to the superposition principle, the acoustic
signal at a given position and time is the sum of the acoustic signals which have been generated by all the individual point SAR
sources separately [26]. Therefore, it is feasible to single out
the SAR values of the tumors and solve for their corresponding
TA signals. In the acoustic simulation, for better comparison between the TA responses of Tumor 1 and Tumor 2, the SAR value
of glandular tissue is set to zero, otherwise signal of Tumor 1

will be immersed in the TA signal of surrounding glandular
tissues. The phantom including the acoustic properties and geometries is unchanged and keep the boundary condition intact.
The simulated TA signals which are only due to the tumors can
be received by the circle sensor array.
After the SAR distributions of the tumors are obtained and
finishing the forward procedure of the TA wave propagation, the
last step is the TA image reconstruction. An improved method
based on the time reversal mirror (TRM) technique is adopted
to reconstruct the TA image [39]. The method used in this paper
calculates the acoustic speed distribution of the background
instead of the assumption that the background is homogenous
for traditional TRM. The TA image for the tumors is shown
in Fig. 7. In the figure, the geometries and locations of the
two tumors are all properly reconstructed. Meanwhile, Tumor 2
(with contrast agent) has stronger strength than Tumor 1.
In addition, in order to quantitatively analyze the TA contrast
between Tumor 1 and Tumor 2, the profile of TA image is plotted
in Fig. 8. For evaluating the reconstruction, the corresponding
profile of original TA source is also plotted in the figure.
The profiles are normalized with their respective maximum
values for contrast comparison. From the profiles, the contrast
between Tumor 2 and Tumor 1 is about 10:7.5 at the peak point.

The TA responses of tissue mimicking materials with different CNTs concentrations are investigated. In this paper, the
peak intensity of TA image is used to represent the TA response.
Fig. 9 shows the TA responses of various samples with different
CNTs concentrations. The samples, which are labeled as A, B,
and C, are with 1%, 0.5%, and 0.22% CNTs concentrations corresponding to volume ratios are 10.30, 5.15 and 2.25 mg/mL,
respectively. D is the reference sample with no CNTs. The profile is normalized by the peak value of sample A. From the curve
of TA response, it can be seen that the TA response of the tissue
mimicking material is significantly enhanced.
In order to quantitatively analyze the TA responses of different samples, the mean pixel values of TA image are listed in
Table IV. The tabular data show that the concentrations of CNTs
as small as 0.22% can increase the contrast of image by 26%.
When the concentration of the CNTs in the tissue mimicking
material is increased to 1%, the TA contrast can be enhanced by
more than 100%.
D. Experimental Imaging Results
In order to validate the performance of the contrast agent,
some experiments are carried out based on the developed MITAT system. According to [40], the concentration of CNTs is
an important factor attributed to the toxicity in the biological
applications, so the sample with the smallest CNTs concentration (0.22%) is adopted in the imaging experiments due to the
consideration of lower risk of toxicity. Furthermore, the 0.22%

(2.25 mg/mL) concentration is within the scope of the security
(safe up to 28.57 mg/mL) [41] when the CNTs are solubilized
by the taurine. Therefore, this concentration has the potential to
be as secure dosage in the real biomedical application.
The phantoms are processed to rectangular shapes with the
section size of 15 mm × 10 mm. Two phantoms are used to
represent tumors with or without contrast agent. Tumor 1 is the
tumor in a precontrast-agent stage and Tumor 2 is infused with
CNTs. In the experiment, Tumor 1 and Tumor 2 are directly
immersed in the acoustic coupling medium which is a homogenous environment. The TA image for the two phantoms is shown
in Fig. 10.
In Fig. 10, it shows that Tumor 2 has larger response than
Tumor 1. The TA response contrast at peak point between Tumor 1 and Tumor 2 is about 10:7.5. Meanwhile, the shape of
Tumor 2 is reconstructed better than Tumor 1. The larger image
strength and better shape reconstruction in Tumor 2 are due to
the stronger TA response caused by the adding of CNTs [14].
Afterwards, in order to further investigate the benefit introduced
by CNTs, two fan-shaped samples are utilized to perform the
imaging experiments. In the experiment, Sample 1 is with CNTs
and Sample 2 is without contrast agent. The TA image for fanshaped samples is shown in Fig. 11.
From the image, it can be seen that Sample 1 has more obvious
arc shape than Sample 2. This result indicates that the quality
of TA image can be improved by using contrast agent.
IV. CONCLUSION
This study is a step towards the development of functionalized, tumor-targeting CNTs as TA imaging agents for breast
cancer detection. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the
effectiveness of the CNTs as a contrast agent and verify the
feasibility for the further study. The contrast enhancing performance of the CNTs is validated by both simulation and experiments. The measurements for conductivity show that CNTs
can increase the contrast in the tissue mimicking materials. A
numerical breast phantom model including several tissues with
different dielectric and acoustic properties is constructed, and

the contrast enhancing performance of CNTs is validated by using an integrated simulation approach. This research result can
be considered as preresearch to the studies by using the anatomically realistic acoustic breast phantom which is constructed
with the similar modeling method in [42]. In addition, the TA
responses of the samples with different CNTs concentrations
show that CNTs can efficiently increase the TA responses.
The experimental results indicate that low concentrations of
CNTs as small as 0.22% can significantly increase the contrast of TA image by 26%. The shape of the specimen infused
with CNTs is better reconstructed than the specimen in the
precontrast-agent stage. The research of this paper shows the
great potential of using CNTs as contrast-enhanced agent in
MITAT for distinguishing the early tumor from the glandular
breast tissues.
