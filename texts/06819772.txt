Abstract—Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are an emerging technology for realizing efficient healthcare and remote
medicine for the aging society of the future. In order to improve the reliability of WBAN systems and support its various
applications, channel modeling and performance evaluation are
important. This paper proposes a simulation-based channel modeling for evaluating the performance of WBAN cooperative transmission schemes. The time series of path losses among seven on-body
nodes are generated by the finite-difference time-domain method
for seven body motions. The statistical parameters of the path loss
for all the motions are also obtained. The generated path loss is
then applied to the evaluation of the two-hop decode-and-forward
relaying scheme, yielding an improvement in transmit power. From
the evaluation of body motion, useful insights are obtained such as
which relay links are more robust than others. Finally, the proposed
approach is validated through comparison with a measurementbased approach.

monitoring, a key function in future healthcare [1]–[5].

removing cables that hinder the smooth operation of daily life
and rehabilitation. For deployment in medical and healthcare applications, the communication links of a WBAN system should

be sufficiently reliable. Therefore, WBAN link properties have
been extensively studied [4]–[25]. As reported in the extensive
literature [22]–[31], cooperative transmission schemes can improve the reliability of WBAN systems.
For evaluating cooperative transmission schemes, it is important to take into account the correlations of shadowing caused
by body movement among the WBAN links [20]. Therefore,
a measurement-based stored channel approach has been proposed [24], [26]–[31]. However, the measurement-based approach cannot guarantee the reproducibility of the measurement
conditions such as position and antenna orientation over a number of measurements. As a result, the impact of the radio channel
cannot be separately evaluated because the measured channel
inevitably includes physical errors such as misorientation or
misplacement. In addition, when a multiport vector network
analyzer or an oscilloscope is used [25]–[28], possible action
scenarios are limited due to the cables. The cables can also be a
source of error due to interference. When wearable sounders are
used [24], [29]–[32], the measurements suffer from the lack of
phase, tradeoff between the number of nodes and sampling rate
due to the round-robin measurement, packet loss, and change of
characteristics due to temperature. Also, calibration is needed,
for which the response time is difficult to guarantee. Moreover,
the effect of antenna type cannot be investigated because the
antenna is embedded in the node.
Because factors included in the measurement are too many to
be separated, it is important to evaluate the contribution of the
underlying propagation mechanisms which are commonly influential in any WBAN channels for achieving general results. Such
underlying mechanisms are the shadowing, reflection, diffraction, and scattering by body parts. Therefore, a numerical electromagnetic simulation has been considered. Among various
techniques, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method
[33] has been widely utilized for both static [23], [35]–[42] and
dynamic [43]–[45] scenarios. In this context, this paper proposes
a numerical channel simulation for the evaluation of WBAN cooperative transmission schemes. The major contributions of this
paper are threefold, as follows:
1) This paper presents a pseudodynamic channel simulation for the 2.45-GHz WBAN cooperative transmission
scheme. Because existing work studied only limited links
that were not sufficient for the evaluation of a cooperative transmission scheme, this paper examines all possible links among seven on-body nodes during seven motion scenarios. Such intensive simulations in a WBAN

achieved, to the authors’ best knowledge.
2) This paper proposes a novel evaluation scheme that combines a stored channel approach and pseudodynamic channel simulation. The proposed scheme is demonstrated for
the two-hop decode-and-forward (DF) system, where the
improvement in the transmit power is examined. Since the
proposed scheme enables the evaluation of various body
motions, useful insights are obtained such as which relay
links are more robust than others.
3) This paper shows that the proposed approach can offer
useful insights into the general tendencies of the cooperative transmission scheme by comparing with the results
of a measurement-based approach.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the simulation scenarios and methodology are presented. In Section III,
the evaluation procedure of the relaying scheme is presented. In
Section IV, the result of the evaluation is presented. This paper
is concluded in Section V.

A. Scenario
Seven on-body nodes are assumed to be attached to the human
body on the head, chest, upper arm, wrist, navel,
thigh, and ankle. Considering the application of vital sensor
monitoring for medical and healthcare, these nodes are selected
based on the possible vital sensors, as shown in Table I [1], [2],
[5]. In order to evaluate the cooperative transmission schemes,
simulation of all node combinations is necessary, because all
nodes can transmit. Each transmitter has six receiver nodes;
thus, the number of links is 7 × 6 = 42. Note that since the
channel reciprocities should be valid, the actual number of links
is 7 C2 = 21.
Seven types of body motions are considered: walking (walk),
walking weakly (weak), running (run), sitting down (sit),
wearing a jacket (wear), sleeping (sleep), and lying down
(lie). Walk, weak, and run are variations of walking motions. Sit and lie are variations of up-and-down movement. Wear and sleep are relatively irregular postures and
movements.
The body motions are modeled using frames. The models are
same as those used in [44] and were created by Poser, a 3-D

from the models along with their associated frame index. The
number of frames Nfram e used in the simulation are listed in
Table II. The frame rate is 30 frames/s.
The models also include diamond markers that indicate the
position and direction of the antennas. Antennas are assumed
to be infinitesimally small dipoles normal to the human body
surface. Infinitesimally small dipoles approximate the characteristics of small antennas. The length of the infinitesimally small

B. Pseudo-Dynamic Channel Simulation
The FDTD method [33] was utilized for the WBAN channel
simulation. Since the antenna direction is not always aligned to
the coordinates of the cells, the simulation was conducted by
decomposing the source into three orthogonal components along
the cells in the same manner as [44]. The obtained E-field was
converted into path loss using the effective antenna length and
radiation resistance. The numerical validation of this procedure
is presented in Appendix A. The Doppler spread is assumed
to be negligible compared to the speed of body movement, as
measured in [16].
The frame index, nodes, transmitter, and receiver are denoted
by i ∈ {1, 2, ..., Nfram e }, A = {chest, head, upper arm,
wrist, navel, thigh, ankle}, Tx ∈ A, and Rx ∈ A \ Tx ,
respectively. First, an infinitesimally small dipole pointing in the
x-direction is placed at the position of the transmitter Tx in the
computational domain. Applying the FDTD method, the electric
field ex ∈ C 3×1 is obtained at the position of the receiver Rx .
Similarly, ey ∈ C 3×1 and ez ∈ C 3×1 are obtained by pointing
the dipole in the y- and z-directions, respectively. The transfer
matrix S is formulated as

S(Tx , Rx , i) = [ex (Tx , Rx , i) ey (Tx , Rx , i) ez (Tx , Rx , i)].

Next, the electric field along the receiving antenna direction,
denoted as e, is synthesized by
e(Tx , Rx , i) = v(Rx , i)T S(Tx , Rx , i)v(Tx , i)

(2)

where v ∈ C 3×1 is the directional vector that represents the
transmitter or receiver antenna direction. Note that |v| = 1.
Finally, the obtained electric field is converted into path loss
as in [47] by
PL(Tx , Rx , i) =

Pt
Pr (Tx , Rx , i)

(3)

where Pt is the transmitted power and Pr is the received power in
the simulation. They are obtained from the radiation resistance
Rr , the complex amplitude of feed current I, and the effective
antenna length L [55]. The radiation resistance Rr of the onbody dipole is 2.50 Ω, obtained numerically, as described in
Appendix B.
Table III shows the simulation setup. The frequency was
2.45 GHz so that the wavelength λ was 12.2 cm. The cell size
was chosen to be 0.5 cm so as to be smaller than 0.8 cm,
half the wavelength inside the human body. The computational domain consisted of (300, 460, 300) cells, corresponding
to (12.3, 18.8, 12.3) λ or (150, 230, 150) cm. The absorbing

boundary condition was ten layers of perfectly matched layer
(PML). The time step was 5.0 ps and the number of iteration
was 5000. The dielectric constant and the conductivity of the
body were chosen to be 53.57 and 1.81 S/m, respectively, in
accordance with the values of average muscle at 2.45 GHz [48].
The authors developed an FDTD solver for WBAN channel
simulations. The solver runs on multiple graphics processing
units in parallel for different frames in order to improve the
computational speed. The simulation environment was TSUBAME 2.0, the supercomputing environment of Tokyo Institute of
Technology [49]. The authors used eight Thin nodes with 3 Tesla
M2050 each; therefore, 24-Tesla M2050 were used in total.
The original body models, however, could not be used directly
because voxel models were necessary. To overcome this, first the
original body models were exported into Wavefront.obj format
[50]. Then, the Wavefront.obj files were converted into voxel
data using binvox [51], an implementation of the parity count
and ray stabbing methods [52]. Fig. 2 shows an example voxel
model taken from walk.

during walk.

Since the simulation of a single frame
requires 3 (source
directions) × 7 (positions) = 21 runs, 21 × Nfram e = 12 285
runs were performed in total. The simulation time ranged from
6 h 18 m for 30 run frames to 22 h 55 m for 195 wear frames.

ingly, those links have a higher standard deviation than
even ankle-wrist and thigh-wrist links, for which
higher values are expected because the movement of the
wrist is greater than that of the navel or head.
For other body motions, please refer to Appendix C.
Next, in order to confirm that body motions cause correlations
among link combinations, the cross correlation coefficients [20]
in dB were calculated. As explained above, there are 21 on-body
links when including channel reciprocity. Therefore, the cross
correlation coefficients for 21 C2 = 210 combinations were calculated. Since it is difficult to show the result for all possible
combinations, the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of
the cross correlation coefficients are presented in Fig. 4.
As can be seen, the CDF curves are steep around zero for
all body motions, meaning that the majority of the links are
uncorrelated with one another. On the other hand, some links
show significant correlation. In particular, links are relatively
highly correlated in sleep, where the CDF value is 0.771 at a
cross correlation coefficient of 0.5, meaning that 22.9% of the
links have the cross correlation coefficients higher than 0.5. In
addition, these links tend to have a positive rather than negative
correlation.
III. COOPERATIVE TRANSMISSION SCHEME EVALUATION

C. Results

A. Two-Hop DF Relaying

As an example of the simulation results, the path loss between the navel to other nodes during a walk is shown in
Fig. 3. The path loss fluctuates differently depending on the
node. The navel-chest link has little path loss as well as
small fluctuation. On the other hand, the link such as navelankle has relatively large path losses and severe fluctuation,
such that the use of relaying is expected to improve its reliability. Because stochastic modeling of such temporal behavior of
the on-body links is very complicated, direct evaluation using
calculated channels, the so-called stored channel approach, is
more suitable for various evaluations. This type of data series
was obtained for all node combinations and all body motions.
In order to characterize the link property, the average and
standard deviations in dB during a walk movement were calculated for all node combinations. Because the reciprocities are
confirmed, the average and standard deviation are shown in the
upper and the lower triangles, respectively, of Table IV. From
the table, the following observations can be made:
1) The path loss of the chest-navel, head-chest,
wrist-thigh, and upper arm-wrist links have relatively small mean values (below 40 dB) because the
nodes are close each other. Among them, chest-navel
and head-chest links also have small standard deviations because of the smaller movement.
2) the ankle-thigh link has a relatively low standard deviation because the movements of ankle and thigh
nodes on the same leg are similar. Similarly, the upper
arm-wrist link has a relatively low standard deviation,
as well.
3) On the other hand, the upper arm-navel and thighhead links have higher standard deviations. Interest-

In this section, the simulated channels were utilized to evaluate a cooperative transmission scheme. The two-hop DF relaying scheme, as shown in Fig. 5, was the scheme considered. A
single relay R ∈ A helps the source S ∈ A \ R communicate
with destination D ∈ A \ {R, S}. The packets broadcast from
S to D are also received by R in the first phase; then, R decodes
and forwards the packet to D in the second phase. Node D is
always assumed to be the coordinator, located at navel, and R
is fixed during each body motion scenario. The reason to have
chosen this DF relaying scheme is practical implementation.
Extension to this DF scheme in existing single-hop systems can
be easily achieved just by modifying MAC layer, while amplifyand-forward scheme requires hardware modification.
Here, forward error correction (FEC) is not considered for
simplicity. Assuming the topology update and synchronization
[32] are already established, only the data transmission phase is
considered. It is also assumed that the energy consumption of
the node can be approximated by the data transmission because
the contribution from the micro-controller and idle time is negligible. Collision is not considered because the traffic of the vital
data monitoring is small. The interference from other WBAN
systems is also not considered because there are plenty of operating bands as well as a coexisting mechanism that is available
in IEEE 802.15.6[53]. The PHY parameters were chosen based
on IEEE 802.15.6, as shown in Table V.
B. Evaluation Procedure
To evaluate the performance of the relaying scheme, a Monte
Carlo method was used with simulated path loss PL. The performance metric is the outage probability Pout between source S

Finally, by counting the number of transmissions that satisfy
Γp < Pp , the outage probability Pout is obtained according to

IV. RESULTS
A. Outage Probability
Fig. 6 shows the outage probabilities of the direct and two-hop
links for two selected cases. Fig. 6(a) shows the S = wrist and
D = navel case, for which the relaying scheme is beneficial.
With relay node R = uper arm, wrist, or thigh, the Pout
curve is shifted toward lower transmit power when compared
with the direct link (ankle-navel), indicating that the same
level of outage probability is achievable with lower power by
using the relaying scheme.
On the other hand, the S = wrist and D = ankle case,
shown in Fig. 6(b), has the opposite result. The direct link,
i.e., wrist-navel, has almost always the best performance
compared to relay node links.
B. Best Relay Nodes and Performance Gain
In order to investigate body motion dependence, we define the
performance gain of a two-hop link as the reduction in transmit
power that maintains the same level of outage probability as the
direct link. For example, in the case of Fig. 6(a), the direct link
requires −39.0 dBm transmit power and the two-hop link with
R = thigh requires −19.9 dBm transmit power to achieve the
outage probability Pout = 0.01. Since the cooperative transmission requires two transmissions, a correction factor of −3.0 dB
is introduced. Thus, the performance gain of using R = thigh
is −19.9 − (−39.0) − 3.0 = 16.1 dB.

Repeating the same calculation, Table VI lists the best relay node, i.e., the node that provides the largest performance
gain, for each transmitting node. From this table, the following
observations can be made:
1) Walking scenarios (walk, weak, and run) are notably
similar with respect to the best relay node and performance gain. The ankle-thigh-navel and upper
arm-wrist-navel links show the most significant performance gains, close to or bigger than 10 dB. The headchest-navel link shows a performance gain of less
than 5 dB. The other links show either no or very little
(less than 2 dB) performance gain.
2) Up-and-down motions (sit and lie) are also similar,
although not as significantly as in the walking scenarios.
The chest node does not need a relay, and the best
relay node for the head is chest. Regarding the upper
arm and ankle nodes, although the best relay nodes are
different, the performance gain is significant. In addition,
the similarities in the sub-best relays were observed, as
shown Table VII.
3) During sleep, R = chest is the best relay node for the
head, upper arm, thigh, and wrist nodes.
4) Wear and run motions have similar best relay nodes
and performance gains. Only the best relay node for S =
upper arm is different between them.
5) The best relay nodes for all motions were analyzed. The
chest node never needs a relay node and is always the
best node for the head. The ankle node has thigh
as the best relay node for all motions except lie. The
ankle and upper arm nodes are never the best relay
nodes, and the thigh tends to be the best relay node for
the ankle.
6) These results provide guidelines for the choice of good relay nodes for system design. In particular, because certain
two-hop links are less affected by body motions, predetermined fixed relay schemes can be beneficial.

C. Robustness of the Two-Hop Link to Body Motions
The robustness of the two-hop links to body motion was further investigated by counting Nb o dy , the number of body motions where the two-hop link is beneficial. For example, the twohop link ankle-thigh-navel provides better performance
than a direct link during walk, run, weak, sit, sleep, and
wake but not for lie. Thus, the Nb o dy of this link is six. On
the other hand, the chest-head-navel link never provides
any improvement; hence, its Nb o dy is zero.
Fig. 7 shows the distributions of Nb o dy for all two-hop link
combinations, i.e., 6 × 5 = 30 links, and Table VIII lists the
breakdown of the counts. Eight two-hop links never improve reliability and nine two-hop links improve only one body motion.
However, seven two-hop links work effectively during most
body motions (more than five). These facts indicate a bipolar trend; specific two-hop links are very robust against body
motion, but the others either provide no improvement or are
beneficial only for limited motions.

Because particular two-hop links such as upper armchest-navel are less affected by body motions, a predetermined relaying scheme is robust and practical. On the other
hand, if a two-hop link is necessary for the other nodes, adaptive
relaying might be necessary. For the adaptive relaying case, a
fast and efficient establishment of the two-hop link is possible
based on prior knowledge that predetermines the candidate relay
to reduce the scanning overhead.
D. Frequency of Operation as a Relay Node
Finally, the frequency for which each node is selected as a
candidate relay or best relay was examined. This frequency was
determined for the sources and body motions. Table IX shows
an example of counting the frequency that the chest is the
best relay node. As shown in Table IX, the chest is the best
relay node for 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, and 2 nodes during walk, run,
weak, sit, lie, sleep, and wear motions, respectively.

Fig. 7.

Number of effective two-hop links and different body motions.

By summing up these counts, the frequency for which chest
is selected as the best relay is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 2 =
11. Similarly, the frequency for which a node functions as a
candidate relay and improves performance compared to a direct
link is also counted.
The result for all nodes is shown in Fig. 8. Obviously, the
chest, thigh, and wrist nodes are chosen frequently as a
candidate relay or the best relay node. On the other hand, the
upper arm and ankle nodes are never chosen as the best
relay. Therefore, the role of each relay is clearly distinguished.
This has the following two implications for WBAN deployment.
First, the type of sensor node can be different according to role.
Costs can be reduced by using a simple node with no relay
function for the upper arm and ankle locations. Second, the
energy consumption should be taken into account. When using
an adaptive protocol, a specific relay can be always chosen as a
fixed relay node. This might result in a greater consumption of
energy and hence an energy aware protocol is needed.
E. Comparison With the Measurement-Based Approach
In order to show the validity of the proposed simulation-based
approach, a comparison was made with the measurement-based
approach. Figs. 9 and 10 show the wearable sounder and the

measurement setup, respectively. The wearable sounder was a
Crossbow XM2110 IRIS mote for 802.15.4 ZigBee at 2.4 GHz,
and the environment was a corridor in a university building. Further details are available in [29]. From the measurement data, the
candidate relay nodes during a walking motion were evaluated,
as shown in Table X. Good agreement in general was observed

for the candidate relay node and range of performance. Four
links out of seven that were predicted to improve performance
by the proposed approach actually showed performance improvements when measured. Environment, node position, body
shape, and so forth could be possible reasons for the remaining
differences. Therefore, it has been shown that the proposed approach can offer useful insights about the general tendencies of
a cooperative transmission scheme.

1) The effectiveness of the relaying was confirmed in terms
of performance gain defined as the improvement of the
transmit power. For example, the upper arm-wristnavel and ankle-thigh-navel links show a 7.2–
28.5 dB performance gain during walking motions (walk,
run, and weak). The head-chest-navel link has a
2.8–10.8 dB performance gain for all seven motions.
2) Similarities in relay node selection and performance gain
were observed for similar motions: walking motions
(walk, run, and weak) and up-down motions (sit and
lie).
3) Seven relay links that were robust for different body
motions were identified. In addition, 17 relay links that
could expect almost no performance gain were also identified. This information can be used to design relay node
selection.
4) It was found that the chest, thigh, and wrist nodes
are more likely to be chosen as a relay node.
Through comparison with the measurement-based approach,
the proposed approach was shown to indicate general tendencies
in the cooperative transmission scheme. Four out of seven links
predicted to improve performance in the proposed approach actually showed performance improvement when measured. Although the demonstrated evaluation is limited, the proposed
approach could be readily extended by combining the simulated
path loss with specific cooperative transmission schemes.

V. CONCLUSION
This paper presented a simulation-based channel analysis for
WBAN cooperative transmission schemes. The link properties
required to evaluate cooperative transmission schemes were
computed using an FDTD method at 2.45 GHz, an approach
that has not previously been reported in the literature. The simulation covers all possible links among seven on-body nodes
in terms of seven motions. From the simulation, the mean and
standard deviation of the path loss were also calculated. The simulated path loss was then applied to the evaluation of a two-hop
DF relaying scheme. As a result, useful insights were obtained
as follows:

APPENDIX A
VALIDATION OF PATH LOSS SYNTHESIS
In this appendix, the source decomposition and path loss
synthesis technique used in Section II is validated. When the
dielectric constant and conductivity of the human body are set
to those of vacuum, i.e., 1.0 and 0.0 S/m, the simulated result
should agree with the Friis Transmission Formula [47]. Performing the simulation for 30 frames during a walk motion
when transmitting node Tx is the navel, the root-mean-square
error (RMSE) is calculated for all samples. The definition of
RMSE is

E[|PLfriis − PL|2 ]

(13)
RMSE =
E[PL2friis ]
where E[·] denotes the mean. The RMSE is −27.4 dB, which is
in good agreement with and therefore consistent with the Friis
Transmission Formula.
APPENDIX B
SIMULATION OF RADIATION RESISTANCE
The radiation resistance of an infinitesimally small dipole on
the human body surface is numerically obtained in this appendix.
The simulation setup is shown in Fig. 11. An infinitesimally
small dipole is placed above a body surface that is modeled as
a lossy dielectric plane. A cubical observation surface obtains
the supplied power. In this configuration, the supplied power
should agree with the sum of the outgoing power Po and the
dissipated power Ps [55]. Therefore, the radiated resistance Rr

568

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. 19, NO. 2, MARCH 2015

the effect of the standing wave on the calculation of dissipated
power is negligible. The obtained Rr is 2.50 Ω.
The simulation without body tissue was also performed in order to validate the simulation setting. Comparing the simulated
and analytical results [47], the relative error is 1.23%, sufficient
for path loss calculation.

where I is the complex amplitude of the feed current.
In order to accurately simulate the proximity, the cell size is
set to 1/4 the original cell size used in the channel simulation,
i.e., 1.25 mm. An infinitesimally small dipole of 5 mm length
is modeled as four current sources in series, 1.5 cm (12 cells)
above the body surface. The size of the observation surface
is 12.5 cm (100 cells) along each side and each side of the
computational domain is 37.5 cm (300 cells). The absorbing
boundary condition consists of 10 layers of PML.
Fig. 12 shows the strength of the electric field over the cross
section of yz plane when the simulation is performed. Inside the
body tissue, the electric field is highly attenuated. In addition, the
standing waves inside the body tissue manifest as stripes in the
distribution of the electric field. These standing waves are due
to the mismatch between the body tissue and PML. However,
compared to the direct radiation from the infinitesimally small
dipole, the standing waves are small because the reflected waves
from the PML are also absorbed by the body tissue. Therefore,
