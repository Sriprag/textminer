Abstract—As the first step in developing a new clinical technique for the magnetic detection of colorectal sentinel lymph nodes
(SLNs), a method is developed to measure the magnetic content in
intact, formalin fixated lymph nodes using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). A suspension of superparamagnetic nanoparticles is injected ex vivo around the tumor in the resected colon
segments. A selection of three lymph nodes is excised from the region around the tumor and is separately measured in the VSM. The
iron content in the lymph nodes is quantified from the magnetic
moment curve using the Langevin model for superparamagnetism
and a bimodal particle size distribution. Adverse, parasitic movements of the sample were successfully reduced by tight fixation of
the soft tissue and using a small vibration amplitude. Iron content
in the lymph nodes is detected with 0.5 μg accuracy and ranged
from 1 to 51 μg. Histological staining confirmed iron presence.
The current method of measuring intact biological tissue in a VSM
is suitable to show the feasibility and merit of magnetic detection
of SLNs in colorectal cancer. For clinical validation of magnetic
SLN selection in colorectal cancer, a new magnetometer with high
specificity for superparamagnetic nanoparticles is required.

I. INTRODUCTION
AGNETIC nanoparticles have become increasingly important in both noninvasive and minimally invasive medical applications [1], [2]. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles have
already been used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) for a long time [3], [4]. Furthermore, the use of
magnetic nanoparticles for drug delivery [5]–[8] and hyperthermia treatment [9] remains under development. One of the new

developments is the use of magnetic nanoparticles for sentinel
lymph node (SLN) detection. In Japan and the U.K., magnetic
detection of SLNs using a handheld probe was developed for
lung [10], [11] and breast cancer [12]–[14]. Similar experiments
using a high-TC SQUID gradiometer were demonstrated in a
rat model [15]. A recent study shows the applicability of magnetic nanoparticles as contrast agent for photoacoustic imaging
which can provide intraoperative lymph node staging [16]. The
present clinical procedure of SLN detection includes selection
of the lymph nodes that drain the tumor area by a technetium
marker and blue dye to apply advanced microscopic analysis
(ultrastaging) to detect metastasis [17], [18]. The presence of
metastasis is important for disease staging and subsequent clinical decisions. SLN biopsy helps the pathologist to select nodes
with the highest chance for (micro)metastasis. When no metastasis is found with normal hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)
staining, ultrastaging—which is time consuming—can be exclusively restricted to the SLNs.
The introduction of magnetic nanoparticles in SLN procedures can improve diagnosis and therapy for various tumors. In
case of colorectal cancer, diagnosis can be improved by more
specific selection of the SLNs. This can increase staging accuracy and subsequently, it can help to plan an adequate therapeutic path [19]. In breast cancer and melanoma, magnetic
SLN detection has to compete with the well performing, but
logistically more complex, combined method using radioactive
tracer and blue dye. Magnetic detection largely simplifies logistics and safety protocols and makes potentially accurate SLN
detection accessible for hospitals that do not have a department
for nuclear medicine. In those hospitals significant therapeutic
improvements can be achieved by introduction of a reliable SLN
procedure.
In surgical procedures of colorectal cancer, a complete colon
segment is resected including all lymph nodes surrounding the
tumor. Sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) for this type of
cancer is still in development and is potentially highly beneficial
[20]–[25]. The procedure is introduced to obtain a more precise
diagnosis and is technically still developing regarding tracers
and surgical approach. The majority of studies use only a blue
dye as contrast agent and are performed either in vivo or ex
vivo [19]. A suspension of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)
nanoparticles is an attractive alternative for both blue dye and
technetium in colorectal cancer.
The added value of magnetic nanoparticles compared to the
generally used technetium and blue dye tracers is that they are
stable and, therefore, detectable and quantifiable over time. The

restricted lifetime of technetium-99m and the fluidity of blue
dye limit the time frame of reliable detection of the SLN after
surgery. The use of a physically more stable tracer allows ex
vivo detection several hours after surgery. In such an ex vivo
procedure, the SLN detection aims to make an accurate selection
out of all harvested lymph nodes, rather than a search in a tissue
mass for one specific tracer containing lymph node. All lymph
nodes are individually selected as SLN based on the presence
of magnetic tracer. This postoperative procedure reduces the
burden on costly operating time.
Another advantage of a tracer with particles is to reduce the
chance to select higher echelon nodes. The particles in a magnetic tracer are more easily trapped in the SLN compared to
the fluidic blue dye that may spread further to higher echelon nodes [26]. At present, it is still unknown whether these
nanoparticles will end up in the SLNs (first echelon) after ex
vivo injection. Physiological processes in the lymphatic system, like macrophage activity, are expected to stop soon after
resection. Moreover, detection of ex vivo particle uptake can
be limited because the lymph nodes in the mesenterium are
rather small in size and ex vivo infiltration of particles might be
low. The experiments in this first study have to show whether
the nanoparticles can still accumulate in the SLNs in ex vivo
circumstances.
The stability of a magnetic tracer provides the opportunity
for a feasibility study of ex vivo magnetic SLN detection in
colorectal cancer in an extramural laboratory. Therefore, a clinically suitable instrument is not needed a priori. Detection of
SPIO in an SLNM procedure serves to decide whether a particular lymph node is a candidate for additional microscopic
analysis. The detection system has to give a decisive answer
about the presence of tracer. Therefore, a highly sensitive and
specific detection system is required. Spatial imaging of tracer
is inferior to a more reliable indicator of tracer presence. Therefore, magnetometry methods selectively sensitive for nonlinear
magnetic properties of SPIO are preferred over less specific
laborious quantitative MRI techniques that are susceptible to
assumptions about background signals from tissue, (geometry
of) SPIO distribution and detection thresholds [27]. Different
spectroscopic methods that have been developed to quantify
SPIO content in cell samples, require sample digestion and
are, therefore, not compatible with histopathologic analysis in
a SLNM procedure [28]. In this study, the SLNs were quantitatively analyzed using a standard vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Quantification of particle uptake serves to determine
technical requirements for development of a clinically suitable
magnetometer.
The magnetic analysis of fresh or formalin-fixated biological
tissue using a VSM is a challenging procedure. In several studies, magnetometry of biological tissue was achieved at rather
low temperatures (T < 273 K) or after freeze-drying the sample
to enable a firm fixation [29]–[34]. Such a procedure is problematic if the sample has to remain intact for clinical histological
analysis. Therefore, in the present study a reliable, nondestructive VSM-method was developed to measure the magnetic content of SPIO particles in intact diamagnetic biological samples
at room temperature. Despite the time-consuming and clini-

2595

cally impractical technique of VSM, the measurements provide
important information for the development of a clinical magnetometer to replace the VSM in the methodology presented
here.
The objective of the current study is first to show, with a limited number of experiments, the feasibility of magnetic nanoparticles as tracer for ex vivo SLNM in colorectal cancer. The second objective is to determine the quantitative requirements for
a clinically suitable magnetometer that can perform fast ex vivo
analysis of the colorectal lymph nodes. Since the focus in this
study is on the technical feasibility of magnetic nanoparticles in
ex vivo colorectal tissue, the patient-specific clinical results and
their consequences are topic of future papers.
II. EXPERIMENTS
A. Superparamagnetic Particles and Clinical Application
The Endorem MRI contrast agent (Guerbet Nederland B.V.,
Gorinchem, The Netherlands) is chosen as superparamagnetic
tracer for identification of the SLNs. This tracer is a suspension
of SPIO nanoparticles coated with dextran in a concentration
of 11.2 mg iron per mL. The hydrodynamic particle size is reported in a range of 58–186 nm [35], [36]. The lymph nodes are
harvested from resected tissue of patients with colorectal cancer who underwent a standard surgical procedure. Immediately
after resection, the colon part containing the tumor is brought to
a separate field and is injected submucosally around the tumor
with 1.5–2.0 mL of Endorem and massaged for about 5 min
to induce particle flow into the lymphatic system. Macrophage
activity responsible for in vivo lymphatic processing of magnetic nanoparticles [37] is expected to stop immediately after
resection. Therefore, mechanical transport of particles through
the interstitial space and the lymphatics should be maintained
ex vivo to get the SLNs filled with tracer. Since VSM analysis of
all the lymph nodes in each specimen would be very time consuming and magnetic detection of the lymph nodes in situ was
not possible, a parallel SLN selection procedure with blue dye is
used. Patent Blue V (Guerbet Nederland B.V., Gorinchem, The
Netherlands) is injected additionally after Endorem to enable the
visual selection of SLNs by the pathologist. For each patient,
the blue lymph nodes nearest to the tumor, with a maximum
of three, are considered as SLNs and are resected for analysis
of iron content and placed in formalin for 24–72 h. The local ethics committee of the hospital Medisch Spectrum Twente
in Enschede was informed and agreed with the experimental
procedure.
B. Sample Placement
All samples are placed in an NMR glass tube (WilmadLabGlass, Vineland, NJ, USA) with an inner diameter of
8.16 mm and an outer diameter of 10 mm. To prevent uncontrolled movement during VSM-measurements, the samples are
fixated between two plastic parts inside the tube [see Fig. 1(a)].
The upper part is adjustable in length to allow for different sample sizes; typically for lymph nodes between 2 and 10 mm. In
addition, the soft lymphatic tissue with some surrounding fat can

be compactly fixated. To reduce noise from liquid movement,
the level of remnant formalin in the tube is as low as possible.
Automatic offset detection by the VSM system itself is often not
accurate because of low or absent magnetization in biological
tissue. Therefore, the axial distance from the bottom of the tube
to the center of the sample is measured manually to determine
the optimal VSM-offset position in the detection coil set.
C. VSM Procedure
Measurements are performed using the VSM of a physical
property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design Inc.,
San Diego, CA, USA) with a maximum magnetic field capacity
of μ0 H = 9 T. The applied field range is lower (μ0 H = 4 T) to
prevent samples from large forces while approaching magnetic
saturation for Endorem particles. The vibration frequency was
40 Hz, whereas the vibration amplitude was 0.5 mm. This low
amplitude reduces the forces acting on the sample by a factor of
4, compared to the default amplitude of 2 mm. Consequently,
noise caused by interfering, parasitic movements due to soft
tissue is reduced. The lymph nodes are relatively large compared
to most samples normally measured in a VSM. To fit the NMR
tube containing the lymph node, a custom-made VSM detection
coil was used with an inner diameter of 10.6 mm [see Fig. 1(b)].
To investigate sensitivity of magnetic detection and to calibrate the VSM for Endorem containing lymph nodes, a series of
calibration samples was prepared. Small glass containers were
filled with 15 μL diluted Endorem ranging from 1:1 to 1:150,
which corresponds with 168 to 1.12 μg iron in a sample. In
addition, some larger samples containing 500 and 1568 μg iron
were used to increase accuracy of the calibration factor. Furthermore, a known Endorem sample is measured while immersed
in formalin to investigate the noise contributions from free liquid formalin. Samples with Patent Blue V and formalin are
measured to exclude the effect of superparamagnetic or ferromagnetic contributions when present in lymph node samples.
To determine the correction for the demagnetization of the su-

VSM measurements of lymph nodes placed in the NMR tube
with plastic fixation parts are assumed to exhibit a superparamagnetic component originating from the nanoparticles, a diamagnetic component originating from the tissue and a paramagnetic component originating from the sample holder. Magnetic
moment versus field curves of the sample were analyzed in
MATLAB (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) by a parameter optimization of a model that includes the three different
magnetic components. Before the optimization, some preprocessing of the data was necessary to remove some additional
effects from the data, which is explained hereafter.
In the first step, a correction is made to the measured field to
compensate for demagnetization of the superconducting magnet
in the PPMS [38]. The palladium measurement should theoretically show a strictly anhysteretic linear curve. Any hysteresis
observed in this measurement can be attributed to the demagnetization of the magnet during the measurement. This causes an
inaccurate field measurement that should be corrected to obtain
coinciding ascending and descending branches in measurements
of anhysteretic materials. To compensate for demagnetization
of the superconducting magnet, a field correction of 1750 A/m
is applied to each dataset. Then, the assumption is made that
no hysteresis is present in the Endorem sample at ambient temperatures [39] and the Langevin model for superparamagnetism
can be applied.
The strength of the linear components in the measurements
vary over different samples and are eliminated from the optimization by subtracting the linear approximation of the magnetic
moment in the high field region. In most studies, this component is determined by a “background” measurement. There are
three reasons why this cannot be done in the current study: 1)
the magnetic contribution from tissue cannot be determined in a
separate measurement before tracer administration and depends
on the size of a lymph node and the amount of surrounding fat
and thus, differs for each lymph node, 2) the amount of formalin surrounding the sample varies, and 3) since the variable
size of the calibration samples and lymph nodes needs finetuning of the fixation system, the paramagnetic contribution of
the sample holder in the detection coil differs from sample to
sample. Therefore, the sample-dependent linear component is
approximated by a linear fit of the data measured from 90%
of the field maxima (|H|m ax ). The superparamagnetic component of the magnetic moment of the sample is assumed to be
saturated in this region. Although this is not true for contributions of very small superparamagnetic particles, this approach
can be used when the model describing the superparamagnetic
component is subjected to the same procedure. Therefore, the
model is also subjected to a linear subtraction, which is based
on the slope of the modeled superparamagnetic component in
the same high field range as the measured data. So, to obtain
the most likely parameters describing the curvature of the magnetic moment curve, the model and the data are matched in the

VISSCHER et al.: QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF SUPERPARAMAGNETIC CONTRAST AGENT IN SENTINEL LYMPH NODES

high field region by linear approximation, while the particle size
distribution parameters in the fitting algorithm that describe the
unsaturated nonlinear superparamagnetic part are optimized by
minimization of the error between data and fit.
Asymmetry in the positive and negative branches of the measured curve was treated by an offset correction. Finally, the
magnetic moment curve is normalized in order to exclude the
saturation value from the parameters to be optimized. Then, a
normalized model for the superparamagnetic component can be
compared with the normalized data.
The optimization procedure is now only dependent on the
shape of the superparamagnetic components, which is determined by the particle characteristics in the sample. The superparamagnetic component is modeled by the Langevin model for
superparamagnetism [40], described by
L(xk H) = coth(xk H) −

with

(2)

The constants μ0 , kB and parameter T represent vacuum permeability, the Boltzmann constant, and the absolute temperature
(always 300 K in our case), respectively. The Langevin function
is specific for a particle size with magnetic moment mk [A·m2 ]
and depends on the applied magnetic field strength H [A/m].
Since the size of a magnetic nanoparticle determines its magnetic moment, a sample with a certain particle size distribution
has also a certain magnetic moment distribution. Therefore, the
model describing the experimental data has to take into account
a distribution of magnetic moments [41]. The magnetic moment
of a superparamagnetic particle is related to its diameter Dk [m]
by the bulk saturation magnetization Ms [A/m] of iron oxide
Fe3 O4 (μ0 Ms = 0.60 T, [41]) via
mk =

πDk3 Ms
.

For magnetic nanoparticles, a unimodal log-normal particle
size distribution is generally accepted [42], because it is physically very likely and can be explained by physical phenomena
during the production process [43]. Furthermore, transmission
electron microscopy results of Endorem indicated a log-normal
core size distribution [39]. The numerical approach of the lognormal particle size distribution is defined as
f (Dk |D1 , σ1 ) =

k = (1, . . . , K)

(4)
where D1 and σ1 are the mean diameter and standard deviation of the associated normal distribution, respectively. The
distribution is calculated for a broad range of K different particle diameters with diameter step size Dstep . By substituting
(3) for each Dk into (1) and (2) and multiplying each resulting Langevin function by its weight from the distribution
f (Dk |D1 , σ1 ) · Dstep , the contribution from each particle size
is computed.

2597

However, the model of the magnetic moment curve using a
unimodal log-normal distribution for Endorem did not result in
a suitable approach of the data. Especially in the region of the
strongest curvature, the model cannot match the data. Therefore,
the unimodal log-normal distribution cannot represent the core
size distribution of Endorem and a core size distribution with
other shape parameters has to be used. Since particle production
processes often result in log-normal distributed populations, it
is reasonable to add a second log-normal distribution in the fit,
which gives more degrees of freedom to the modeling curve.
The bimodality of the particle size distributions may originate
from the production process of the nanoparticles. A chemical
growth process, such as precipitation used for Endorem production [39], [44], comprises initial nucleation and growth, after
which some original (smaller) seeds may remain in the colloid,
which gives rise to two log-normal distributed particle size populations [45]. In present analysis, the bimodal distribution is
only a way to model the most probable experimental magnetic
moment curve using the most relevant parameters of the size distribution. Implementation of a bimodal log-normal distribution
requires three additional parameters to be optimized: a second
mean and standard deviation for the distribution and the relative
weight factors p and (1 − p) for each distribution.
Finally, the sum of all modeled Langevin functions for the
bimodal log-normal distribution describes the model to be optimized

where m represents the total field-dependent magnetic moment
of the sample and n the number of particles. This model as well
as the data is normalized and the best parameters are determined
by minimization of the root of the sum of squares of the logarithmic differences between the model m(H) and measurement
data msam ple (H) [46]:

This minimization for five parameters is performed using
the Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm, which is an unconstrained
nonlinear optimization algorithm implemented in the MATLAB
software package [47]. The minimization gives optimal parameters for the particle size distribution.
After the optimum distribution has been determined, the original superparamagnetic component, which is lost in the normalization, can be reconstructed. The linear subtraction applied to
the model is added again to both the normalized model and
the normalized measured data. The total magnetic moment responsible for superparamagnetism in a sample is determined by
the sum of magnetic moments of the individual particles. This
can be derived from the factor that was used for normalization of the data. To finish the quantitative reconstruction of the

(2–4 μm) for histological analysis by a pathologist. The presence
of metastases is revealed by H and E and Cam 5.2 histological

superparamagnetic component, both model and data were multiplied by this factor, which is basically the saturated magnetic
moment.
For relatively large linear contributions in lymph node measurements, the quantification of the superparamagnetic component is very sensitive for noise, since after linear correction the
relatively small errors made at high fields have a large effect
on the small amplitude of the superparamagnetic component.
Therefore, reduction of movement noise is particularly important for the quantification of samples with low amounts of iron.
Determination of all parameters of the bimodal particle size distribution is, therefore, not suitable for each individual lymph
node measurement. For that reason, the parameters of the particle size distributions found for the calibration samples are
averaged and used in the model to quantify the iron content
in lymph nodes. This average bimodal distribution is based on
all measurements of calibration samples with an fit error lower
than 0.5 [see (6)]. Thereby, it is assumed that the particle size
distribution of the superparamagnetic cores in the lymph nodes
is the same as in the original tracer. The hydrodynamic size
distribution of the particles that enter the lymph nodes might
be different from the distribution in the original tracer, because
the tissue and lymphatic system can be considered as a filter
that may trap the larger particles. In the lymph node analysis
presented here, the core size distribution in lymph nodes is assumed to be the same as in the original tracer, which supposes
that hydrodynamic size is not directly related to magnetic core
size. Finally, there remain three parameters to be estimated for
the lymph node measurement. The first parameter is the saturated magnetic moment ms , which corresponds to the amount of
iron. The second parameter is the linear component χH, added
to estimate the volumetric susceptibility χ of paramagnetic or
diamagnetic material. The last estimate is an offset correction
that is applied to correct for asymmetry.

shows the normalized measurement and the curve of the optimized model on
linear scale. The mid panel shows the difference between the model and the
measured data. The negative and positive differences indicate that the model is
well positioned in between the descending and ascending branch of the loop,
showing some unphysical hysteresis due to measurement error. The lower panel
on bilogarithmic scale gives more insight in the quality of measured data and the
model in the low field region. Superparamagnetism is confirmed by the absence
of significant hysteresis in the low field region. The bimodal log-normal particle
size distribution that resulted in the best modeling curve is shown in the inset.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Calibration and Parameter Modeling
Different samples with a known quantity of Endorem were
used as reference measurement to calibrate the system, as well as
to develop the parameter modeling of the total magnetic moment
of a sample. The model achieved for the measured data and the
accompanying bimodal particle size distribution is shown in
Fig. 2. For the average particle size distribution further used
for lymph node quantification, the following parameters were
found: D1 = 4.5 nm, σ1 = 0.47, D2 = 8.3 nm, σ1 = 0.29, and
p = 0.52. These values are in the same range as was found
using a unimodal log-normal distribution for TEM analysis of
Endorem nanoparticles [39], [48], [49]. The bimodal core size

distribution has a more broadened peak compared to a unimodal
log-normal distribution, but does not show two clear separate
maximums. The use of the bimodal log-normal distribution does
give more freedom to the shape of the distribution and does not
implicate that there are two clearly distinguishable populations
of particle sizes.
The deviation of the model from the measured data revealed
a systematic measurement error (see Fig. 2). The ascending
and descending branches of the loop do not coincide, which
causes dissimilar differences between the measurement data
and the model. This may indicate hysteresis in the sample, but
the asymmetric and inconsistent pattern of deviation argues for
measurement errors.

Fig. 3. Two examples of a VSM measurement of a lymph node containing Endorem and the corresponding microscopy images with Pearls Prussian Blue staining.
Endorem content corresponds with (a) 46.7 μg and (b) 11.9 μg iron. The green line indicates the model applied to the data points measured, including a linear (χ)
and nonlinear component with amplitude m s . The corresponding histology images (c and d) with Pearls Prussian Blue confirm the presence of SPIO and indicate
interstitial spread of the particles throughout the sinuses of the lymph nodes.

Since the saturated magnetization at a high field strength is
used as calibration to estimate iron content in other samples,
the model should be as precise as possible in this region. The
calibration with the lowest amount of 1 μg iron could not accurately be quantified, but still shows a minor superparamagnetic
component indicating the detection limit. The lowest amount of
Endorem that could be quantified corresponds to 1.5 μg Fe with
an error of ±0.5 μg. This detection limit depends strongly on
the quality of the measurement and the contribution of linear
magnetic materials. The calibration constant used to quantify
lymph node samples with a saturation field of 3.18 · 106 A/m
was 7.76 · 10−8 A·m2 μg−1 .
Measurements of samples with Patent Blue V and formalin
did not show any nonlinear magnetic contribution that may
interfere with the superparamagnetic contribution from particles
accumulated in the tissue (results not shown). So, the presence
of Patent Blue V and formalin in or around lymph node samples

will not affect an accurate estimation of the superparamagnetic
component from the tracer.
B. Lymph Node Analysis
The magnetic content in lymph nodes is determined based
on the average particle size distribution found in the calibration
samples. The Endorem mass in the lymph nodes is determined
using the Langevin model with the bimodal distribution described in Section II-D. Although in most cases a significant
linear contribution was present, a superparamagnetic nonlinear
component could be well estimated by the algorithm, and therefore, a background measurement became unnecessary. This is
important, because a background measurement for the lymph
nodes would even be impossible for this clinical application.
The magnetic moment curve of two lymph nodes is shown in
Fig. 3. There is an obvious difference with the curve in Fig. 2

because of the linear contribution from sample holder and tissue. Both the superparamagnetic and the linear component are
estimated by fitting the parameters ms and χ, respectively. The
calibration constant derived from a series of known Endorem
samples (see Section. III-A) is used to determine the iron mass
in the lymph node. Over all, from 13 patients and 33 lymph
nodes included in the study, Endorem content was detected in
24 lymph nodes and was found in the range of 1.1–51.4 μg iron.
The mean quantity of iron found in lymph nodes was 17.1 μg.
Light microscopic analysis of the lymph nodes with Pearls Prussian Blue staining confirmed iron presence in each lymph node
that was detected by magnetometry (see Fig. 3). The iron presence was observed in the interstitial space in all but one lymph
node. In that particular lymph node macrophages stained positive for iron.
Some measurements suffered from significant noise and possibly sample displacement. The lymph node samples with a substantial proportion of fat tissue are more susceptible to abusive,
parasitic, lateral movements. This is overcome by a stronger
fixation of the sample, resulting in lower noise and subsequent
accurate quantification of the amount of iron. The remaining effect of motion-generated errors is represented in the error of the
fit procedure [see (6)], which is on average 1.61 for lymph nodes
compared to 0.24 for the calibration samples. However, for the
present study this error is small enough to obtain a quantitative
indication of Endorem filling of colorectal lymph nodes in an ex
vivo sentinel node procedure. Future systems for the magnetic
lymph node analysis need to be designed such that this kind of
errors do not occur.
There are two possible reasons that some blue nodes that were
selected as SLNs by definition did not contain iron. First, the
definition of the SLN may have failed by selecting lymph nodes
that are not true SLNs. The probably more selective magnetic
tracer has only reached the true SLNs in that case. This cannot be
verified, since lymph node mapping is unable to reveal whether
a lymph node is a first or higher echelon node. The second
reason could be that the ex vivo circumstances reduced magnetic
tracer migration toward lymph nodes. Therefore, some of the
SLNs may be missed by the magnetic tracer. These aspects of
the procedure should be investigated in a more elaborate clinical
study that allows magnetic measurements on all the lymph nodes
in a specimen.
Interestingly, the results show that ex vivo SLN mapping with
magnetic nanoparticles is feasible. Lymphatic drainage of Endorem particles from the tumor in ex vivo colorectal tissue
is possible by mechanical actuation, such as massage. Other
physiological mechanisms of lymphatic transport, including
macrophage uptake which is normally present in living tissue [37], are, therefore, not necessary for the selection of SLNs
in colorectal cancer. After ex vivo injection, the particles flow via
the interstitial space through the lymphatics to the SLNs, driven
by mechanical pressure induced by massage. In in vivo cases
SPIO accumulates normally in macrophages, but this activity
is believed to cease soon after resection of the specimen. Other
studies have shown the utility of ex vivo SLNM in colorectal
cancer using a noncolloidal blue dye [20]–[25]. This study has
shown that despite the use of particles in ex vivo SLNM, the

tracer ends up in lymph nodes. The use of particles might even
be contributing to accurate sentinel node selection, since the
chance of selection of second echelon nodes might be reduced.
The specific clinical value of the use of magnetic nanoparticles
in colorectal SLN mapping should be investigated in a more
elaborate patient study.
The accumulated particles in SLNs are detectable by highly
sensitive laboratory equipment. Although Endorem was a pragmatic choice for reasons of availability, it performed well as
tracer for SLNs. However, further development of magnetic
SLNM in colorectal cancer should consider the optimal magnetic and hydrodynamic particle size and composition. The
success of technetium based SLN procedures has shown to be
dependent on the particle size of the applied colloid [50], [51].
The development of magnetic nanoparticles with a higher (magnetic) yield will lower the requirements for new clinical instruments to be developed or may increase the sensitivity of the
procedure.
For several reasons, an experimental laboratory VSM system is not suitable for clinical applications. The large magnetic
fields and helium cooling, as well as sample mounting and long
measuring time, are significant drawbacks for clinical use of
a VSM. Therefore, further development of fast, high-sensitive
magnetic detectors is desirable. Exploiting the nonlinear behavior of the SPIO particles in AC susceptometry or a frequency
mixing technique [52], the detection can be very specific, which
is mandatory for samples with unknown diamagnetic content.
In colorectal cancer, the SLNs have to be selected out of a series
of about 10–25 resected lymph nodes per patient. Therefore,
a clinical magnetic detection instrument with high sensitivity
and short processing time would enable pathologists to use their
specific microscopy techniques for ultrastaging on magnetically
selected SLNs, so as to find high-risk patients who may benefit
from adjuvant therapy.
C. Other Techniques of SPIO Quantification
In the literature, several other techniques to quantify SPIO in
biological samples are described. Besides magnetometry, optical and mass spectroscopies are used to analyze SPIO content
in cell samples. Inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy is a
highly sensitive but expensive method that is not suitable for
routine sample analysis. These techniques are very sensitive for
SPIO, but require sample digestion which is not compatible with
histopathologic analysis in SLNM [28], [53], [54].
Since Endorem is developed as MRI contrast agent, the uptake of particles can be revealed by MRI. MRI techniques to
quantify SPIO concentrations in samples are based on the field
inhomogeneities produced by the particles. These field inhomogeneities can be quantified by measuring a reduction in
relaxation time [53] or by model-based reconstruction based
on a measured phase map [55], [56]. Boutry and colleagues
could quantify magnetic nanoparticle content in cell samples
by relaxometry [53], however, their procedure is not applicable in SLNM because it requires sample digestion and thus,
impedes histopathologic analysis of intact samples. Problematic in SPIO quantification with MRI are other sources of field

VISSCHER et al.: QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF SUPERPARAMAGNETIC CONTRAST AGENT IN SENTINEL LYMPH NODES

inhomogeneities in a sample, like gradient instabilities and
tissue–tissue or air–tissue interfaces that all may cause the contribution from SPIO nanoparticles to be indistinguishable [27],
[56]. Therefore, (background) measurements that allow identification of these other components are often required to determine the exact contribution from SPIO [55], [57], [58]. This
makes MRI procedures much more complex and time consuming, since in case of SLNM, the SLNs also have to be measured
before tracer administration. For ex vivo procedures, this would
postpone the time-critical tracer injection, and therefore, the
identification rate of the procedure may become affected. Finally, MRI is an expensive technique which is less specific for
nonlinear magnetic properties and, therefore, less suitable for
ex vivo SLNM with SPIO. Therefore, magnetometry is more
selective for the specific nonlinear characteristics of SPIO can
be much more accurate, less expensive, and easier to implement
in clinical practice.
IV. CONCLUSION
SLN mapping using superparamagnetic nanoparticles is successfully applied in colorectal cancer patients. Although a dispersion of nanoparticles is used in the ex vivo tissue, the tracer
ends up in lymph nodes. This study shows that nondestructive VSM measurements on fresh or formalin-fixated lymph
nodes can reveal the magnetic properties inside, provided that
the lymph nodes are firmly fastened. The nonlinear superparamagnetic contribution arising from the magnetic nanoparticles
in the tracer is distinguishable and quantifiable by modeling
the magnetic moment curve with the Langevin model and a bimodal log-normal core size distribution. Furthermore, detection
and selection of Endorem-filled SLNs in ex vivo colorectal tissue was proven to be possible by a detection limit of 1 μg iron.
Selection of the SLN in colorectal cancer using a selective colloidal magnetic tracer can help to accurately intensify standard
histopathological analysis by additional staining of those nodes
that most probably contain metastases. To facilitate the clinical
application of magnetic SLN detection in colorectal cancer, a
clinical magnetometer has to be developed that allows quick and
specific detection of the nonlinear properties of superparamagnetic tracer in lymph nodes.
