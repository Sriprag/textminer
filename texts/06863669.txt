Abstract—Dynamic fluorescence molecular tomography
(DFMT) is a potential approach for drug delivery, tumor
detection, diagnosis, and staging. The purpose of DFMT is to
quantify the changes of fluorescent agents in the bodies, which
offer important information about the underlying physiological
processes. However, the conventional method requires that the
fluorophore concentrations to be reconstructed are stationary
during the data collection period. As thus, it cannot offer the dynamic information of fluorophore concentration variation within
the data collection period. In this paper, a method is proposed
to reconstruct the fluorophore concentration variation instead
of the fluorophore concentration through a linear approximation.
The fluorophore concentration variation rate is introduced by the
linear approximation as a new unknown term to be reconstructed
and is used to obtain the time courses of fluorophore concentration.
Simulation and phantom studies are performed to validate the
proposed method. The results show that the method is able to
reconstruct the fluorophore concentration variation rates and the
time courses of fluorophore concentration with relative errors less
than 0.0218.

measurements of fluorescent photons over the surface of targets, FMT is able to recover the location and quantity of fluorescent agents to reveal biological processes at molecular and
cellular levels. So far, it has been successfully applied in the
researches of inflammation [3], oncology [4]–[8], and drug
discovery [9], [10].
The change of the biodistribution of drug or imaging contrast
agent within the body can offer significant information about
the underlying physiological processes. Dynamic imaging is a
feasible approach to quantifying such change. It has been used
in some imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) [11] and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [12].
As a noninvasive, nonionizing, and relatively low-cost imaging
technique, dynamic FMT (DFMT) is a promising approach to
investigating the dynamics of fluorescent agents. DFMT is able
to offer the dynamic processes of absorption, distribution and
excretion of the fluorescent agents within body. Consequently,
it is a potential approach for drug delivery [13]–[17], tumor
detection, diagnosis, and staging [18], [19].
In the conventional method of DFMT, the distributions of
fluorophore concentration at different time points are reconstructed first and then curve-fitting or pharmacokinetic analysis technique can be applied to the distributions to obtain
the time courses of fluorophore concentration [13]–[17] or
pharmacokinetic-rate images [18]. The reconstruction method
requires that the fluorophore concentrations are stationary during the data collection period. However, the concentrations are
varied in actual DFMT. Hence, this method cannot offer the dynamic information of fluorophore concentration variation within
the data collection period and the reconstructed images of fluorophore concentrations might be influenced by the fluorophore
concentration variations.
In this paper, a method is proposed to reconstruct the fluorophore concentration variation instead of the fluorophore concentration. A linear approximation is used to quantify the dynamic processes of metabolism of fluorescent agents. This leads
to a new unknown term, named as fluorophore concentration
variation rate, to be reconstructed. The fluorophore concentration variation rate has a direct relationship with the inherent
temporal correlations in dynamic measurements. It can also be
converted into the fluorophore concentration and then be used
to obtain the time courses of fluorophore concentration. The
proposed method is validated by simulation and phantom studies. Both the simulation and phantom studies are carried out on
a cylinder with two tubes inside filled with varied concentrations of fluorescent agent (specifically indocyanine green (ICG)

for the phantom studies). In the simulation studies, the measurements are generated by a numerical solution of coupled
diffusion equations using finite-element method (FEM). In the
phantom studies, the measurements at different time points on
the time courses of fluorophore concentration are obtained by
a noncontact, full-angle FMT imaging system, and then are
used to synthesize the dynamic measurements by linear interpolation. In both cases, the fluorophore concentration variation
rates are reconstructed by the proposed method and then are
used to obtain the time courses of fluorophore concentration.
The results show that the proposed method is able to reconstruct the fluorophore concentration variation rates and the time
courses effectively.

For continuous wave FMT, the forward model can be described by a couple of diffusion equations with Robin-type
boundary condition [20]–[23]. The FEM is a powerful method
to numerically solve the diffusion equations for arbitrary geometries. By taking advantage of FEM, the forward model of
FMT can be converted to [22]

where Φ denotes the photon density vector for the excitation
(subscript x) or fluorescence light (subscript m) and Q denotes
the excitation source vector. They are column vectors with a
length of Nn , where Nn is the number of nodes of the mesh
used in FEM. X = ημaf is a column vector of the unknown
parameters to be reconstructed with the same size as Φ and Q,
where η is the quantum yield and μaf is the absorption coefficient of fluorophore to the excitation light. K is the stiffness
matrix with a size of Nn × Nn , and F is a matrix with the same
size as K. The elements of K, F , and Q are given by

period, the object to be imaged is placed on the rotation stage
after injecting the fluorescent agent. Then the rotation stage
rotates with a certain angle. The fluorescence projection data at
different angles are collected by CCD. To obtain the dynamic
measurements, the rotation stage needs to rotate with numbers of
circle continuously. Let Nf denote the number of circle needed
and Ns denote the number of projection angle in each circle.
In the reconstruction process, the data collected in one circle
corresponds to one frame of image.
To quantify the fluorophore concentration variation, a linear
approximation is proposed. The unknown parameter X shown
in (1) is assumed to vary linearly with time during each circle.
It can be expressed as follows:
Xi = X0 + iΔtk

(5)

where X0 is the initial value of each circle, Δt is the temporal
interval between two projection angles, i is the index of projection angle in one circle, and k is the variation rate of X. k is
assumed to be a constant during each circle, i.e., k is piecewise
constant during Nf circles. In addition, X, X0 , and k are also
spatial variables.
According to [25], the relationship between fluorophore concentration and the absorption coefficient of fluorophore is as
follows:
μaf = ln(10)εC

(6)

where ε is the fluorophore extinction coefficient and C is the
fluorophore concentration. If C varies linearly with time, X
will also vary linearly with time since X = ημaf = ln(10)ηεC.
Therefore, k in (5) will represent the speed of fluorophore concentration variation assuming that η and ε are constant for a
certain fluorescent agent. It is called as fluorophore concentration variation rate in this paper.
For simplification, a single frame case is considered first. By
substituting (5) into the second equation of (1), the following
relationship between Φi and k is formed:
Φi = Ai X0 + iΔtAi k

C. Reconstruction Method
The memory and time consumptions in the reconstruction
are two obstacles due to the suddenly increased size of the
system matrix. Regarding the memory consumption, however,
the system matrix shown in (15) only needs to be saved as three
small matrices P , U , and T .
The widely used algebraic reconstruction technique (ART)
[26], [27] is chosen to solve (15), as follows:

(11)

Equation (9) is the system equation for a single frame case.
Based on it, the multiframe case is now considered. When the
time point is at the mth frame and the ith projection angle, (5)
can be expressed as
Xm ,i = X0 + Ns

this equation, the maps of fluorophore concentration variation
rates of different frames and the initial value X0 can be obtained.

As shown in (15), the system matrix W consists of four parts:
the first column, the diagonal part, the lower triangular part, and
the higher triangular part. Each part has a special structure that it
consists of the same block matrix (for instance, the first column
is composed of the block matrix P ). In addition, T and U are
of similar structures according to (11) and (17). Consequently,
when (18) is used to solve (15), it is inevitable to consume
time on the same calculations. The redundant calculations are
focused on the parts Wn E (n ) and aWnT , where a = λ(Γn −

used to synthesize the dynamic measurements.

of in the whole cylinder. To reduce the computational time, only
the center slice at z = 2.7 cm was reconstructed. The concentrations varied with the time were generated from a metabolic
model of ICG [28] [see Fig. 2(c)].
The algorithm was implemented in MATLAB 7.8 (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) and a commercial finite element
software COMSOL Multiphysics 3.5 (COMSOL, Stockholm,
Sweden) was employed to generate the mesh used in FEM and
assemble the matrices K and F shown in (1). In the simulation
studies, the measurements were generated from (1) with 1%
Gaussian noise added. A tetrahedral mesh with 12 199 nodes
and 67 616 elements was used to generate the measurements
and a triangular mesh with 1460 nodes and 2814 elements was
used in the reconstruction. The optical coefficients were set as
μs = 10.0 cm−1 and μa = 0.02 cm−1 . Fifty frames of measurements were generated according to the red curves in Fig. 2(c)
with 18 projection angles per frame (20◦ per step). The number of measurements used in the reconstruction was 46 800. The
model was illuminated by a line source and the temporal interval
between two projection angles was 2 s, i.e., Nf = 50, Ns = 18,
and Δt = 2 s.
In the phantom studies, a noncontact, full-angle FMT imaging
system [24] shown in Fig. 1 was used to get boundary fluorescence measurements. In order to obtain dynamic measurements,
first, two tubes filled with ten groups of different concentrations
of ICG [indicated by the blue points in Fig. 2(c)] were used as
the fluorescent targets to acquire ten sets of measurements over
360◦ illuminations and detections. Then linear interpolation was
used upon these measurements to generate dynamic measurements between neighboring time points, as follows [29]:

i=1

where Wa,b,c and Pb,c denote a certain row of W or P , respectively, and a, b, and c are the frame index, projection angle index,
and detector index, respectively.
The function of (22) is used to accomplish the common calculations of {T ki }i=1,...,N f and {U ki }i=1,...,N f −1 . Then (23)
is used to compose W E (n ) . Equations (22) and (23) are used to
accelerate the calculations of (19).
In general, a modified formula of ART with (22) and (23) is
used to eliminate the redundant calculations to accelerate the
reconstruction.
III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
In order to validate the performance of the proposed method,
simulation and phantom studies were performed. Both the simulation and phantom studies were carried out on a cylinder with
two tubes inside filled with varied concentrations of fluorescent
agent (specifically ICG for the phantom studies), as shown in
Fig. 2(a) and (b). The cylinder and tubes had the same height of
5.4 cm and different radiuses of 1.5 cm and 0.2 cm, respectively,
and the two tubes were located with an edge-to-edge distance of
0.8 cm. A line source was placed along the z-axis as the excitation source. Due to the uniform distribution of fluorescent agent
and excitation light source along the z-axis, the distribution of
fluorescence did not vary with z at the center part of the cylinder.
Thus, the reconstruction could be restricted on a plane instead

where D(t) denotes the data to be synthesized, t is the corresponding time point, D(T2 ) and D(T1 ) are the data acquired
from the system, and T2 and T1 are the corresponding time
points. A triangular mesh with 1427 nodes and 2708 elements
was used in the reconstruction and the number of measurements
was 45 900. The data acquisition time was 36 s for one frame of
data (2 s for each projection angle).
The imaged phantom was made of a glass cylinder filled with
1% intralipid (μs = 10.0 cm−1 , μa = 0.02 cm−1 ). Two glass
tubes filled with varied concentrations of ICG was immersed in
the phantom with an edge-to-edge distance of 0.8 cm as shown in
Fig. 2(a) and (b). In the experiments, the phantom was placed on
a rotation stage. A 300 W xenon lamp (Asahi Spectra, Torrance,
CA, USA) coupled with a 770 ± 6 nm bandpass filter was used
as the excitation source. A −70◦ cooled electron multiplying
charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera (iXon DU-897, Andor
Technologies, Belfast, Northern Ireland, U.K.) coupled with a
Nikkor 60 mm, f/2.8D lens (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA) was
placed on the opposite side of the phantom as the detector. A
840 ± 6 nm bandpass filter was placed in front of the EMCCD
for fluorescence detection. After data collection of fluorescence
imaging, a set of white light images at different projection angles
was collected to recover the three-dimensional (3-D) geometry

IV. RESULTS

TABLE I
RELATIVE ERRORS OF RECONSTRUCTION RESULTS

In the reconstruction, the relaxation parameter λ was empirically set as 0.5 and the initial estimation of the solution was
set as E (0) = [ 0 · · · 0 ]T . The reconstructions were terminated
after 150 iterations in both the simulation and phantom studies.
Fig. 3 shows the reconstructed maps of initial value (X0 ) and
fluorophore concentration variation rate (k) normalized by the
maximum in the simulation and phantom studies, respectively.
After reconstruction, the regions delimited by half of the maximum on k maps around the tubes 1 and 2 were identified as the
regions of interest (ROI). The means of fluorophore concentration variation rate (k) in the ROI were calculated and then were
used to get the fluorophore concentration (X) at different time
points by (13). The means of normalized k in the ROI are shown
in Fig. 4(a) and (c) while the curves of normalized X are shown
Fig. 4(b) and (d), respectively. The relative error [30] was used
to quantify the mismatch between the reconstructed and true
time courses of fluorophore concentration. It was calculated as
follows:
Xrecon − Xtrue 2
(25)
RE =
Xtrue 2
where Xtrue denotes the true values of the fluorophore concentrations and Xrecon denotes the reconstructed ones. The relative
errors of the reconstructed results are shown in Table I.
From Figs. 3 and 4, it can be found that the reconstruction
results are consistent with the experimental setup in both the
simulation and phantom studies. At the rising part of the time

courses (frames 1 to 6), the fluorophore concentrations increase
rapidly at the beginning and slow down until reaching the peak.
Accordingly, the reconstructed values of fluorophore concentration variation rates are positive and decrease with the time as
seen on the second and third columns of Fig. 3. The fluorophore
concentration in tube 2 rises more rapidly than that in tube 1,
so the reconstructed k values in tube 2 are higher. During the
declining part (frames 7–50), the reconstructed values of k are
negative, as seen on the fourth to sixth columns of Fig. 3. As
tubes 1 and 2 have a similar speed of decline, the values of
k are similar. Fig. 4 shows that the fluorophore concentrations
change evidently within the data acquisition time of one frame,
especially at the rising part of the time courses (i.e., from 0 to
216 s) and the reconstructed time courses are consistent with
the true ones.
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
It can be seen from the results that the proposed method
is able to reconstruct the fluorophore concentration variation
rate and time courses of fluorophore concentration effectively.

ZHANG et al.: RECONSTRUCTION OF FLUOROPHORE CONCENTRATION VARIATION IN DFMT

Compared with the conventional reconstruction method which
only offers a stationary distribution of fluorophore concentration
within the data collection period, the proposed method can provide the distribution of fluorophore concentration at any time
point by a conversion of fluorophore concentration variation
rate using (13). The linear approximation is the key approach
to converting the reconstruction of fluorophore concentration
into the reconstruction of fluorophore concentration variation.
Through the relationship between the fluorophore concentration variation rate and measurements described by (15), the
fluorophore concentration variation rate can be directly reconstructed from the inherent temporal correlations of dynamic
fluorescence measurements.
As shown in Table I, the relative errors of the reconstructed
time courses of tube 1 (0.0027 in simulation studies and 0.0218
in phantom studies) are higher than the ones of tube 2 (0.0008
in simulation studies and 0.0050 in phantom studies). It demonstrates that the reconstructed time courses of the low concentration tube (tube 1) are less consistent with the true ones than
those of the high concentration tube (tube 2). The inconsistency
between the reconstructed and the true values is caused by the
ill posedness of the inverse problem of FMT. The normalization
of time courses by the maximum of the high concentration tube
makes the normalized reconstructed time courses of tube 2 be
closer to the true ones than those of tube 1 because the peaks of
both the reconstructed and true time courses of tube 2 are 1. If
the maximum of the low concentration tube is used to normalize
the time courses, the relative errors of tube 1 will be reduced
but those of tube 2 will be increased. Moreover, the relative
errors in the phantom studies (0.0218 for tube 1 and 0.0050
for tube 2) are higher than the ones in the simulation studies
(0.0027 for tube 1 and 0.0008 for tube 2). It demonstrates that
the results of the phantom studies are worse than those of the
simulation studies, which attributes to the complexity of real experiments. The simulation studies are implemented on an ideal
situation that the locations of sources and detectors are exactly
known and the noise is Gaussian type. However, in real experiments, the locations of sources and detectors are obtained
approximatively and the noise in the measurements is more complicated. These factors result in the worse performance of the
phantom studies.
As shown in Fig. 3, the two tubes are hard to distinguish
in some frames, which attributes to the low spatial resolution
of FMT. It derives from the highly diffusive nature of photon
migration in tissues and ill-posed characteristic of the inverse
problem. The multimodality imaging, which combines FMT
with other imaging techniques such as X-CT and MRI, is an
important technique to overcome the ill-posed characteristic to
improve the performance of FMT [4], [31], [32]. This would be
a feasible approach to improving the performance of the proposed method. In addition, multivariate image analysis such as
principal component analysis (PCA) [33]–[35] and independent
component analysis (ICA) [36] is an effective technique to resolve the functional structures with different kinetic patterns.
This technique is feasible for the reconstructed images of the
fluorophore concentration variation rate in the proposed method
to resolve the structures.

Although the method presented here is based on a noncontact,
full-angle FMT imaging system, it can also be extended to a
planar geometry system [14] or fiber-coupled system [37]. Due
to the stationary positions of sources for different frames, the
matrices {Fi }i=1,...,N s will be stationary and meanwhile the
temporal interval Δt between two projection angles can also be
stationary, which leads to the same structure of system matrix
as (15) for the planar geometry system or fiber coupled system.
In this work, a 3-D reconstruction problem is converted into
a two-dimensional (2-D) one in both simulation and phantom studies, which significantly reduces the computational time
(about 3 min for 150 iterations in both simulation and phantom
studies). For a 3-D reconstruction problem, the time consumption on reconstruction will become a burden due to the enormous
system matrix. If the reconstruction is carried out on a tetrahedral mesh with about 10 000 nodes, the computational time will
be increased to several hours. Graphics processing unit (GPU)
technology will be a feasible tool to reduce the computational
time [38], [39].
Due to the ill-posed characteristic of the inverse problem,
the reconstruction results of FMT are sensitive to the noise in
measurements. A general approach to suppressing the influence
of the noise is regularization such as Tikhonov regularization
[20], [22], which is controlled by a regularization parameter.
ART, the reconstruction method used in the proposed method,
is also an effective technique to handle the noisy projection
measurements [26]. The relaxation parameter of ART shown in
(18) has a similar function as the regularization parameter.
There are still some factors to inhibit the usage of DFMT on
small animals in vivo. First, the delivery route of drugs is complicated and they might spread all over the body through circulatory system instead of accumulating at some specific locations,
which leads to a poor contrast for imaging. Second, accurate
maps of optical coefficients are essential for the forward model
of FMT. At present, the optical coefficients used in reconstruction are assumed to be homogeneous in the imaged object, but
they are heterogenous. This inevitably influences the quality of
the reconstructed images. Therefore, a number of actual factors
should be considered under the in vivo situation. It is out of the
scope of this paper and will be the aim of our future work.
In conclusion, a method is proposed to reconstruct the
fluorophore concentration variation instead of the fluorophore
concentration in DFMT. This method can offer the dynamic
information within the data collection period. The results of
simulation and phantom studies show that the proposed method
can reconstruct the fluorophore concentration variation rates
and the time courses of fluorophore concentration with relative
errors less than 0.0218.
