Dentate Gyrus: Critical Role for Topography in
Determining Spatiotemporal Network Dynamics

Abstract—Goal: This paper describes a million-plus granule cell
compartmental model of the rat hippocampal dentate gyrus, including excitatory, perforant path input from the entorhinal cortex, and feedforward and feedback inhibitory input from dentate
interneurons. Methods: The model includes experimentally determined morphological and biophysical properties of granule cells,
together with glutamatergic AMPA-like EPSP and GABAergic
GABAA -like IPSP synaptic excitatory and inhibitory inputs, respectively. Each granule cell was composed of approximately 200
compartments having passive and active conductances distributed
throughout the somatic and dendritic regions. Modeling excitatory
input from the entorhinal cortex was guided by axonal transport
studies documenting the topographical organization of projections
from subregions of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex, plus
other important details of the distribution of glutamatergic inputs
to the dentate gyrus. Information contained within previously published maps of this major hippocampal afferent were systematically
converted to scales that allowed the topographical distribution and
relative synaptic densities of perforant path inputs to be quantitatively estimated for inclusion in the current model. Results: Results
showed that when medial and lateral entorhinal cortical neurons
maintained Poisson random firing, dentate granule cells expressed,
throughout the million-cell network, a robust nonrandom pattern
of spiking best described as a spatiotemporal “clustering.” To identify the network property or properties responsible for generating
such firing “clusters,” we progressively eliminated from the model
key mechanisms, such as feedforward and feedback inhibition,
intrinsic membrane properties underlying rhythmic burst firing,
and/or topographical organization of entorhinal afferents. Conclusion: Findings conclusively identified topographical organization
of inputs as the key element responsible for generating a spatiotemporal distribution of clustered firing. These results uncover a functional organization of perforant path afferents to the dentate gyrus
not previously recognized: topography-dependent clusters of granule cell activity as “functional units” or “channels” that organize
the processing of entorhinal signals. This modeling study also reveals for the first time how a global signal processing feature of a
neural network can evolve from one of its underlying structural
characteristics.

I. INTRODUCTION
EVELOPING large-scale quantitatively-based models of
neural systems has become a realizable goal in recent
years [1]–[3], largely because of three major developments: 1)
data collection over the course of the past several decades has
led to substantial databases of anatomical and physiological
properties for many neural systems [4]–[11]; 2) the development of sophisticated and parallelizable software systems for
representing these anatomical and physiological characteristics
[12]–[15]; 3) the continued growth of high-performance computing systems capable of sustaining the numerical burden of
such large-scale models [16], [17].
One of the most extensively studied regions of the brain is the
hippocampal formation. Numerous anatomical analyses over
the course of the last century have documented the classes,
numbers, and organization of principal neurons [18]–[22] and
interneurons [23], [24] in this limbic region. Extensive studies
at the electron microscopic level have provided knowledge of
the numbers, densities, membrane locations, and neurotransmitter properties of synapse populations [25]–[29]. Despite this
wealth of knowledge, there have been few detailed quantitative models of the hippocampal system. Those that have been
developed have been limited to subregions of the hippocampus, understandably given the complexity of the system. These
initial models have been successful in providing insights into
functional properties of the hippocampus at a subsystems level
[30]–[33].
Here, we describe the first step in an implementation of a fullscale model of the hippocampal formation. We have dealt with
the first stage in what has been termed the intrinsic “trisynaptic
pathway” of the hippocampus, i.e., the “perforant path” excitatory projections from the entorhinal cortex (EC) to granule
cells of the dentate gyrus (DG), including inhibitory feedback
from DG interneurons. Our model is based on the hippocampal
formation of the rat, as the majority of quantitative anatomical
information available is for the rat species. We have taken into
consideration a number of factors concerning the EC–DG projection in an attempt to attain a model that is as biologically
realistic as is achievable given current knowledge. In general,

these factors include: the number and ratio of layer II EC neurons
and dentate granule cells; the ratio of inhibitory interneurons and
dentate granule cells; the dendritic morphological structure and
morphological variability of granule cells; the terminal field
distributions of EC layer II cells; the synaptic density of EC
layer II cells onto dentate granule cells; the passive membrane
properties of granule cells; both somatic and dendritic active
conductances responsible for the action potential (AP) and for
other voltage-dependent properties.
One other anatomical feature that is also the focus of this study
concerns the topographical organization of EC–DG projections.
Topography of anatomical connections, i.e., the point-to-point
relation of a typically nonuniform synaptic connectivity between
any two brain regions, is a property of nearly all mammalian
brain systems, and is distinctly different for each. The topography of EC–DG projections in the rat has been studied elegantly
and reported previously [34]–[38]. The question being asked in
this study is the functional consequence of that topography. To
our knowledge, the issue of the functional significance of the
topographical organization of a projection system has yet to be
addressed quantitatively for any brain system, and is an issue
particularly well suited for a large-scale structural-functional
model. We show here that the topographical characteristics of
EC projections to the DG impose quantifiable boundaries on the
spatiotemporal properties of granule cell network activity. Findings conclusively identified topographical organization of inputs
as the key element responsible for generating a spatiotemporal
distribution of clustered firing. As such, these results uncover a
functional organization of perforant path afferents to the DG not
previously recognized: topography-dependent clusters of granule cell activity as “functional units” or “channels” that organize
the processing of EC signals.
II. METHODS
A. Model Scale and Features
Models of the EC–DG system were completed according to
two scales—one with 1 000 000 granule cells, i.e., equivalent to
the number of cells in one hemisphere of the rat hippocampus
[7], [39], and one with 100 000 granule cells, i.e., equivalent to
1:10 scale to accelerate simulation time. All results reported here
were observed at both scales. All networks studies were composed of dentate granule cells and inhibitory interneurons, with
excitatory input to granule cells modeled after the organization
of layer II EC afferents. In general terms, the models featured
complex and variable morphologies for granule cells, multiple active conductances distributed nonuniformly throughout
granule cell membranes, interneurons configured (as cell bodies
only) to provide both feedforward and feedback inhibition, and
either randomly or topographically organized excitatory input
to network neurons. Specifics are provided below.
B. Granule Cell Morphology
The morphological characteristics of hippocampal dentate
granule cells have been studied in depth and with quantitative
detail [40]–[42]. Representative 3-D dendritic structure was ob-

tained from sample reconstructed neurons labeled using a variety of methodologies and available through neuromorpho.org
[5]. To incorporate morphological diversity in the granule cell
population, however, the L-NEURON tool [43] was used. LNEURON allows for the generation of unique dendritic and
axonal trees based on sampling from a set of statistical distributions that describe their fundamental structural parameters [43],
[44]. Table I shows the distributions used for each of the granule cell parameters, while Fig. 1 shows a sample of L-NEURON
generated granule cell somata and dendritic trees. Only the somata of basket cells were modeled as part of this study, so no
basket cell dendritic structures were included; no cells were
given an explicit axon.
C. Granule Cell Bioelectric Properties
Biophysical properties for each of the cell types in the model
were taken from previously published experimental data and
from previously published mathematical models of the DG [4],
[45]–[52]. Table II shows the channel distribution for granule
cells, while Table II and Fig. 2 show key passive and active
properties for one instance of a granule cell.
The modeled network used AMPA and GABAergic synapses
for connectivity. We modeled the postsynaptic conductance as
a sum of two exponentials, with the rise time, fall time, and
maximum conductance, optimized to match experimentally

recorded EPSPs and IPSPs in both granule and basket cells
[53]–[58], to the extent such data were available. At certain
levels of basket cell inhibition, whether feedforward or feedback, there was pronounced synchrony in network activity (see
Fig. 5). Because highly synchronous firing was not the focus
of this study, and without complete knowledge of IPSP size
for granule cells, we scaled the basket cell inhibition until the
persistent synchrony disappeared. Because axons were only implicitly modeled, a delay to postsynaptic activation was added
to account for axonal conduction of APs. In the million-granule
cell model, the number of synapses in the network corresponded
to the number of reported spines on granule cells [27], [42],
[59]. In the 1:10 scale model, we scaled the number of synapses

down by a factor of 10, while simultaneously increasing the
peak synaptic conductance by a factor of 10. Table III shows the
relevant synaptic parameters for the network.
D. Topography
The EC is divided into two areas termed as the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC).
Anatomically, the LEC lies rostral and lateral to the MEC. Both
areas contribute to the perforant path that projects onto the DG
in a laminar manner. The LEC primarily targets the outer third
of the molecular layer of the DG, and the MEC primarily targets
the middle third [60], [61]. This laminar organization is present
in our model.
Two additional features of the EC–DG projection were used
to define its topography. First, there was the relationship between the position of the presynaptic inputs (cell bodies) and
the position of their projections (axons) onto the postsynaptic

population. Second, there was the geometry of the axon terminal field. The combination of the two features constrained the
subset of the DG population with which a given presynaptic
neuron can synapse.
Experimental analyses have revealed that EC input to the
DG is distributed with a nonrandom topography. In general,
the lateral regions of the LEC and the lateral/caudal regions of
the MEC project to the septal portion of the DG, and the medial regions of the LEC and the medial/rostral regions of the
MEC project to the temporal portion of the DG (see Fig. 3).
Dolorfo and Amaral characterized this topography in rats, and
their work is the basis of the specific topographical relationships implemented here, though we verified the generality of
the Dolorfo and Amaral findings with those of other researchers
[34]–[38]. Dolorfo and Amaral found that any injection within a
particular septotemporal quartile of the DG resulted in the same
characteristic labeling of EC. Therefore, the data were divided
into sets based on the quartiles in which the injection sites were
located in order to calculate the mean EC area that projected to a
given quartile. However, because each injection was performed
on a different rat, each brain map had a different size and shape.
In order to quantify this work, an image processing pipeline was
designed that digitized the brain maps, projected the individual
anatomical brain maps onto a common standard coordinate system, calculated the mean of the data, and projected the resulting
data back onto an average anatomical map (see Fig. 3). An average anatomical map was calculated by computing the mean of
all of the dimensions of the individual anatomical subject maps.
To determine the axon distribution, the maps were converted
into probabilities where the intensity, or darkness of the pixel
corresponded to the probability that an EC neuron located within
would send its axon to a particular quartile of the DG. The
specific point within the quartile to which the axon is sent is
referred to as the “perforation point.”
Upon reaching the perforation point, the axon branches out
into the terminal field. The terminal field was limited to between
1.0 and 1.5 mm in the septotemporal direction, and encompassed

the entire transverse width of the DG within this extent. The
constraints were based on morphological and anatomical studies
that characterized individual axon morphologies and the overall
patterns of projection [61], [62].
E. Computational Platform
All simulations were run on a high-performance compute
cluster consisting of 394 dual quad-core Intel-based nodes and
74 dual hexa-core Intel-based nodes, for a total of 4040 processor cores. The system has 8.1 TB of distributed RAM, 73.1 TB of
distributed disk space, and a maximum theoretical performance
of 38.82 teraflops. All nodes are connected to a high-speed lowlatency 10G Myrinet networking backbone. These nodes are
housed, maintained, and monitored in facilities operated by the
University of Southern California Center for High-Performance
Computing and Communications. We used version 7.3 of the
NEURON simulation engine [12], [63] to run all simulations,
and used Python 2.7 for model specification, data visualization,
and analysis [64], [65].
III. RESULTS
A. Granule Cell Response to Random Entorhinal Input:
Firing in Spatiotemporal “Clusters”
Initial simulations of granule cell network dynamics to an
EC input involved both medial and lateral entorhinal (MEC
and LEC) neurons firing at a mean frequency of 3.0 Hz, accelerated (by design) over the course of approximately the first
1000 ms of the simulation. Time of 4.0 s was simulated in all
results presented here. Entorhinal inputs were topographically
organized according to the relations described in the Methods.
Basket cells were configured to provide both feedforward and
feedback inhibition. All active granule cell membrane properties included those described in Table II. Simulation results
with a one-million granule cell population revealed that despite continued Poisson EC input, granule cells discharged in a

Fig. 4. Simulation results for topographically constrained EC–DG networks with feedforward and feedback inhibition, run at two different scales: 1-M granule
cells (top), and 100-k granule cells (bottom). At both scales, spatiotemporal clusters appear in the granule cell activity, despite the random nature of the EC input.

decidedly nonrandom nonuniform manner. As shown in Fig. 4
(top), granule cells throughout the entire septotemporal extent
of the DG fired in what we call here spatiotemporal “clusters,”
i.e., irregular periods of spiking and nonspiking lasting approximately 50–100 ms “on” and 50–75 ms “off.” The granule cells
engaged in firing changed spatial location along the septotemporal axis, as evidenced by the apparent “drift” in patterned firing
in Fig. 4(A) and other similar figures. The appearance of clustered spiking in response to Poisson EC input was not specific
to million-granule cell populations, but was equally apparent
for simulations involving 100k granule cells as well (see Fig. 4
bottom).
In some cases, the appearance of spatialtemporal clusters did
not appear immediately with the onset of an EC input, but instead
only appeared after a period of highly rhythmic granule cell activity. In those cases, granule cell spiking started after approximately 200 ms, reaching a maximum at approximately 300 ms.
At this time, point granule cell output was highly synchronous,
with granule cells along the entire extent of the septotemporal
axis firing at a high rate for a duration of approximately 100 ms.
Approximately midpoint in this initial 100 ms of extended firing,
basket cells fired synchronously as well, leading to a termination of an extended granule cell firing. After a few more periods
of synchronous granule cell, discharge alternating with periods
of heightened basket cell output the system appears to reach an
equilibrium (after 800–900 ms into the simulation). It is at this
point that a steady state of “clustered” spike discharges emerges
and continues.

Quantitative analyses verified the existence of clusters of
spike firing. Two-dimensional autocorrelation allows an analysis of the data in both spatial and temporal dimensions, and
was used to analyze most of the results presented here. It was
constructed by computing every pairwise cross correlation of
discretized spike trains in a random sample of 10 000 neurons.
The spike trains were discretized by counting the number of
spikes elicited by a particular neuron within a bin size of 5 ms.
The resulting cross correlations were sorted by the distance
between the neuron pairs and were further binned using a resolution of 0.05 mm. The mean cross correlation within each bin
was computed.
The right-hand column of Fig. 4 shows the 2-D autocorrelations for the million cell and 100k cell simulations. What
emerges from the analysis is something that looks like a typical
cluster for each of the datasets; in the million-cell case, clusters
are roughly elliptical, with a temporal width of approximately
40–50 ms and a spatial height of 1–2 mm. The analysis looks
very similar for the 100k-cell simulation, which verifies that
clusters exist and are similar at both simulation scales.
Further analysis was performed on the 100k-cell dataset using
DENCLUE 2.0, a density-based cluster identification algorithm
[66]. For this application, a Gaussian density kernel was used.
Analyses show that 1) clusters exist, and 2) they appear in a wide
variety of sizes, though their basic shape remains similar. Statistical analysis of the identified clusters shows that intercentroid
cluster time is 11 ± 12 ms, and that the density of spikes within
a cluster is approximately 12 ± 9 spikes/ms·mm.

original BC-GC conductance values, while levels 2–4 use 4, 10, and 20 times larger conductance values, respectively. (B) One-dimensional DFT plot of the data.
As the inhibition increases, the granule cells develop synchronous firing at 22 Hz.

B. Mechanisms Responsible for Spatiotemporal Clustered
Spiking: Inhibition
Following this initial characterization, we conducted experiments designed to identify the mechanisms underlying granule
cell clustered spiking: what was responsible for transforming
continuous random spike firing into noncontinuous nonperiodic
clusters of spikes? A first hypothesis concerned a possible role
for GABAergic inhibition, given the strong effect of interneuron
activity in synchronizing granule cell activity in the early stages
of the simulation. Indeed, when a feedback inhibition was increased by 4–10 times that used in initial simulations, longer
periods of synchronous activity marked by multiple bands of
high activity followed by bands of almost zero activity in the
DG followed [see Fig. 5(A)]. This pattern of bands eventually
becomes asynchronous, though giving a rise to spatiotemporal
clusters similar to the ones we see with less inhibition. When
we increase inhibition to a level 20 times greater than normal,
however, the synchrony persists for the entire duration of the
simulation.
One-dimensional discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) were
used to analyze the temporal frequency spectrum of the spike
data. They were computed using a spike density matrix. The

matrix was constructed by counting the total number of spikes
elicited within a spatiotemporal bin with a resolution of 0.05 mm
and 2 ms. The 1-D DFT was computed for each row of the matrix
resulting in the temporal frequency spectrum at a particular septotemporal location on the DG. The mean of all of the resulting
DFTs was then computed.
As Fig. 5(B) shows that as the amount of GABAergic inhibition increases in the network, a small peak at approximately
22 Hz turns into a sharp one, followed by another sharp peak
at about 45 Hz with even more inhibition. This points to oscillations occurring in the low to medium range of the gamma
band. This GABA-dependent rhythmicity has been described
previously [67], [68].
Given the synchrony introduced into granule cell spiking as
a result of feedback inhibition, we decided to remove sources
of inhibition to see whether the cluster activity would also disappear. There are two sources of inhibition in dentate granule
cells: external inhibition, from the basket cell population, and
internal inhibition, due to the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that
granule cells experience after one or more APs. As Fig. 6 illustrates spatiotemporal clusters persist with one or both of these
sources of inhibition absent from the network.

Spatiotemporal clusters are no longer present having been replaced with bands of activity with a high level of background activity. In the 2-D autocorrelation, what
looked like a typical cluster is now a vertical band. Thus, while there is still a temporal variation in granule cell activity, the spatial component is gone.

Spiking: Topographic Organization of Entorhinal Afferents

D. Mechanisms Responsible for Spatiotemporal Clustered
Spiking: Axon Terminal Field Geometry

We next turn to topography as the potential source of clustering. As Fig. 7 shows when the constraints placed on EC-to-DG
connectivity are removed, thus allowing a randomly connected
network where any EC neuron can synapse onto any dentate
granule cell, the clusters that have always been present in the
output disappear, and bands of activity appear in their place.
The 2-D autocorrelation corroborates this; while there is still a
small amount of a temporal structure in the network activity, it
is 8–10× weaker than in any of the topographically constrained
cases, and the spatial component has completely disappeared—
what once looked like an elliptical cluster in the 2-D autocorrelation has become a band that occupies the full septotemporal
extent of DG. Thus, it is the topography of the EC–DG projection that is responsible for the emergence of spatiotemporal
clusters, even when the input to the network is random.

The previous results establish that the emergence of clusters
in the spatiotemporal pattern of the granule cell output is caused
by topography. An immediate question that came to mind, given
these results, is how the parameters of the topography might influence the size and shape of the clusters. The following set
of simulations varied the axons’ terminal field extents in the
septotemporal axis to investigate the contributions of the terminal field geometry to the emergence of spatiotemporal clusters.
These simulations did not include basket cells.
The results clearly show a dependence between the terminal
field size and the cluster size (see Fig. 8). As the size of the
terminal field increases, the cluster size increases. Furthermore,
the density of the cluster decreases as the cluster size increases.
This is verified given that each simulation resulted in approximately the same number of spikes (1 580 000 ± 30 000 spikes

with a range of 1 560 000–1 650 000 spikes). An increase in the
cluster size for the same number of spikes per time signifies a
decrease in a cluster density.
The 2-D autocorrelation demonstrates the relationship between spatiotemporal correlation and the terminal field extent.
The analysis shows that the extent of the spatial correlation between one neuron and any other neuron increases as the terminal
field increases. Also, the terminal field does not appear to affect
the extent of the temporal correlation. However, the maximum
of the 2-D autocorrelation decreases as the terminal field extent increases. An approximately tenfold decrease in the peak
correlation is seen between a terminal field extent of 0.5 and
5 mm.
IV. DISCUSSION
This study described here is based on the creation of a largescale compartmental neuron model of the EC–DG projection
system of the hippocampal formation. We have intended for the
model to be large scale in the sense of including a total number
of dentate granule cells, GABAergic interneurons, and EC axons that are equivalent to those found in one hemisphere of the
rat brain. We have intended the model to be biologically realistic with respect to the numbers and ratios of different classes
of neurons, granule cell dendritic morphologies, classes and

distributions of somatic and dendritic conductances, and the
presence of feedforward and feedback GABAergic interneurons.
In this its first generation of development and use, the model has
uncovered a functional organization of perforant path afferents
to the DG not previously recognized; a spatiotemporal clustering
of granule cell spiking on the order of 11 ms between clusters
and 12 spikes/ms·mm within clusters. These findings are important in several respects. First, these spatiotemporal clusters of
active granule cells represent “functional units” or “channels”
that organize the processing of EC signals. Second, results of
this study clearly demonstrate that the spatiotemporal clustering property of the EC–DG pathway depends primarily on the
topographic organization of perforant path afferents. This is the
first time that a functional characteristic of a cortical projection has been linked specifically to topographic features of that
projection. Third, this organizational property of the EC–DG
pathway is apparent only when structural–functional relations
are examined at large scales. Smaller scale models would not
have revealed the clustering phenomenon, and, thus, these results point to the importance of large-scale modeling of cortical
systems.
The model described in this paper is not complete in the
sense that there are several features of the biological DG not
included in the present model, and that ultimately may modify and extend the results reported here. One of these features

HENDRICKSON et al.: MILLION-PLUS NEURON MODEL OF THE HIPPOCAMPAL DENTATE GYRUS: CRITICAL ROLE FOR TOPOGRAPHY

includes other classes of interneurons within the dentate hilus
that are activated by granule cells and/or perforant path axons, and that provide feedback to granule cells. Most prominent
among these are mossy cells [69], which are the source of the
dentate commissural-associational system [70] and that terminate throughout the inner one third of the molecular layer [71].
This cell population lies beneath the granule cell layer, and is
excitatory to both dentate granule cells and inhibitory interneurons [72], [73]. Additional types of hilar cells are not included in
the present model, e.g., hilar perforant path-associated (HIPP)
interneurons that provide inhibitory input to granule cells in the
inner and outer thirds of the molecular layer, respectively [29],
[74]. The precise role that these and other types of interneurons
[23] play, if any, in modulating the spatiotemporal “cluster”
firing of granule cells has yet to be determined.
Another difference between the present model and one that
is completely biologically faithful concerns NMDA receptor
channels on the dendrites of granule cells. The current model
has only AMPA receptor channels mediating EC–DG glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The NMDA receptor subtype is
activated preferentially by higher frequencies of afferent input
[75], [76], so the shape and/or size of clusters may change with
the inclusion of NMDA receptor subtypes. Future experiments
will determine this, and may be conducted with higher mean
frequencies of EC input.
These additional anatomical and biophysical properties of
the DG will be included in future models, and ultimately will
be examined for their influence on the topography-dependent
clustered firing of granule cells.
Electrophysiological recordings from neurons within the hippocampal formation in the behaving animal have identified a
number of correlates affiliated with animals’ learned behavior
[77]–[79], spatial location [80], or spatiotemporal properties
of the animal learned behavior [81]–[83]. Other studies have
explored the anatomical distribution of spatial firing patterns
of neurons in the hippocampus [84], [85]. Many of these observations have been extended to EC, parahippocampal, and
perirhinal cortices [86]–[88]. Differences between the EC and
hippocampal cortical correlates must be attributable to neural
processing performed by connections between the two structures, with the DG playing a major role [89]. Although speculative, it may be neural processing microstructures like the
EC–DG cluster firing channels described here that are in part
responsible for the EC-to-hippocampal pyramidal cell transformations observed to date.
