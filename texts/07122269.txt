Contraction Pressure
Pengbo Li, Vishal Kothari, and Benjamin S. Terry∗

Abstract—A tethered pressure measurement capsule was developed for measuring the small intestine contraction pressure to assist in locating capsules within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and
quantifying the contact force between the capsule and the small
intestine lumen. The capsule was calibrated statically and dynamically in depth-controlled water at body temperature (37–38 °C). In
vitro tests were performed on an intestinal simulator to verify the
measurement function of the capsule. To perform a preliminary
evaluation of its pressure measuring capabilities, the capsule was
tested at a single location in a live pig model. The pressure signal
from the live animal test was analyzed in the time domain, and
then, the empirical mode decomposition and fast Fourier transformation were applied to analyze the contraction pressure and
ambient pressure in the frequency domain. The contraction rate
was 9.4 to 11.0 times per minute. The peak value of the contraction
pressure was 0.24 ± 0.05 kPa. The successful test of this prototype
lays the groundwork for a future untethered, swallowable version
of the capsule, which will be capable of measuring dynamic pressures while in transit.
Index Terms—Biosensor implanting, capsule, empirical mode
decomposition (EMD), fast Fourier transformation (FFT), small
intestine contraction pressure.

I. INTRODUCTION
INCE G. Iddan conceived a wireless camera pill for imaging the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract in 1981 [1], multiple
research groups have investigated the feasibility of swallowable
robotic capsules (RCs) that are capable of traversing the GI tract
for diagnosing pathologies, sampling the microbiome or tissue,
delivering drugs, or performing next-generation minimally invasive surgical procedures [2], [3]. Carta et al. introduced a
self-propelled and steerable endoscopic capsule for stomach
inspection [4]. Simi et al. developed a capsule for sampling tissue from the small bowel wall [5]. Camilleri et al. proposed a
capsule capable of measuring pH in the GI tract [6]. Beccani
et al. proposed an open-source hardware/software platform to
facilitate the design of RC endoscopes [7]. Moreover, there are
commercially available wireless endoscopic capsules for noninvasively providing images of the lumen of the GI tract, such as

Another application of a swallowable capsule is the implantation of biosensors that are constituents of a body area network,
which enables personal and automated real-time diagnostics
and health assessment [9]. Instead of performing invasive procedures to implant subcutaneous biosensors, a swallowable capsule robot could be used to implant biosensors to the mucosal
lining of the GI tract. In our preliminary work, we designed
a capsule with a mechanism to capture a small piece of the
small intestine lumen for implanting biosensors [9], [10]. The
autonomous implantation of GI tract sensors using swallowable
capsules requires knowledge of the capsule’s position along the
GI tract and whether or not the tissue is in intimate contact
with the capsule so that tissue capture can occur efficiently and
effectively.
Many RCs have onboard video cameras and have attempted to
solve the problem of localization using image processing; however, these localization algorithms are complicated and imprecise [11], [12]. Methods based on wireless signals, ultrasound,
magnetic field, or X-ray need external devices to localize, which
adds significant cost and complexity [13].
Localization of capsules based on the contact pressure between the capsule and the small intestine lumen may be a simple and reliable method that also enables autonomous, ambulatory capsule localization. The GI tract contraction pressure
has diverse, yet predictable patterns called the migrating motor
complex, which has three basic phases or patterns during fasting [14], [15]. Furthermore, the contraction rate is a function of
the GI tract region (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and
colon) [14]–[17]. For example, the average contraction rates of
the stomach, small intestine, and colon are 3, 10, and 4–5 min−1 ,
respectively [17]. At the same time, the movement of the capsule in the GI tract is propelled by the GI tract’s contraction
or peristalsis [18]. The contraction rate and number, and contraction pressure patterns could be used as landmarks or indices
to predict or determine the capsule’s motion in the GI tract for
locating the capsule according to the contraction pressure. At
the same time, if the intraluminal ambient pressure is measured,
the absolute contact pressure between the capsule and the small
intestine lumen could be calculated and used for a biosensor
implantation sequence. In order to locate the capsule and determine the intimate contact between the capsule and the small

intestine lumen based on the contraction pressure, it is important
to measure and characterize the contraction pressure between
the capsule and the small intestine.
GI manometry is traditionally used for GI pressure measurement. GI manometers use tethers, however, which are uncomfortable for the patient and render them unable to reach most
of the small intestine [14], [19], [20]. Furthermore, GI tract
pressure measurement based on balloons, abdominal acoustic
emissions, and electro potential recording is not accurate [21].
The shortcomings of conventional GI manometry have been
partially addressed in [17] and [22], where a capsule is used to
measure the pressure in the GI tract. In addition, a commercially
available capsule, SmartPill (GivenImaging, Ltd., Yokneam, Israel), can measure the pressure in the GI tract. However, none
of these devices differentiate between the GI tract ambient pressure, which is generated from other body processes like respiration and heartbeat, and the contraction pressure between the
capsule and the small intestine lumen. A capsule that is able to
measure the contraction pressure with respect to intraluminal
ambient pressure in the GI tract would be useful.
A. GI Tract Pressure Signal Analysis
Fast Fourier transformation (FFT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and wavelets are very powerful signal processing and analysis tools [23]. Some of these techniques have
already been applied to GI-related biometric analysis. For example, Shuzuo et al. used FFT to analyze acoustic emissions
from the body [24], and Dimoulas et al. described a waveletbased method for long-term processing and analysis of GI tract
sounds [25].
B. Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this study was to develop a preliminary intestine contraction pressure measurement capsule for quantifying
the contact force between an RC-like device and the small intestine. Two micropressure sensing units were used to measure the
ambient pressure and the contraction pressure between the capsule and the small intestine lumen. The capsule was calibrated
via static and dynamic tests and tested on a custom intestinal
simulator [26]. The capsule was then tested at a single position
within the small intestine in an animal. The measured signal
from the animal test was then analyzed via EMD and FFT.
The bench testing and the live animal feasibility study of the
capsule presented in this paper provide fundamental preliminary
rationale for future development of an untethered, swallowable
version of the capsule. The purpose of the swallowable version
will be to: 1) test the hypothesis that a capsule can self-localize
based on intraluminal pressure measurements in the GI tract and
2) measure absolute contact pressure from the small intestine
lumen on a dynamic and mobile capsule.
II. METHODS
A. Functional Requirements of the Capsule
The functional requirements of the capsule were as follows.
The sensing units must work in an in vivo, moist environment

units, 1 and 2). (b) Measurement unit structure. (c) Pressure sensor module.

at body temperature. The capsule must distinguish between the
contact pressure caused by contraction of the GI tract and ambient pressure. The resolution of the measuring unit should be
sufficiently high to measure a weak peristaltic or segmentation contraction as low as 0.1 kPa [27]. The capsule should
transmit measuring data via wireless communication to an in
vitro receiver. In this preliminary study, the capsule was tethered because the main objective of the study was to verify the
measurement function of the capsule. Future versions of the
capsule will have wireless communication and will be mobile
within the GI, thus, the capsule must support these future capabilities. The capsule’s diameter and length must be equal to, or
less than 13 mm × 30 mm, which is close to the dimension of
commercially available capsules [8]. Finally, the capsule should
be sufficiently responsive to measure the dynamic nature of the
contact forces which have a frequency range of 0.15 to 0.2 Hz
[14]. In summary, the capsule must have the following features:
1) small dimensions: no larger than 13 mm × 30 mm;
2) ability to differentiate ambient pressure and contraction
pressure;
3) resolution of pressure measurement higher than 0.05 kPa;
4) ability to work properly in an in vivo environment (body
temperature, high humidity, etc.);
5) time constant of measurement smaller than 0.1 s;
6) capable of untethered operation (for a future swallowable
version).
B. Design of the Capsule
A CAD model of the capsule is shown in Fig. 1(a). The diameter and length are 12 and 30 mm, respectively. The capsule has
two pressure measurement units: unit 1 measures the contraction pressure and ambient pressure, and unit 2 measures only
the ambient pressure in the small intestine.
Fig. 1(b) shows the details of the pressure measurement unit,
which consists of a rubber sheet, an O-ring, silicone oil, and
a pressure sensor shown in Fig. 1(c). The rubber sheet was
fixed by the O-ring and sealed via ultraviolet glue. The pressure
sensor (MS5803–05BA, Measurement Specialties) was assembled to the pressure port on the capsule via interference fit. The

capsule was printed by a 3-D printer. Fig. 1(d) shows the capsule
prototype. The pressure sensor has a built-in analog-to-digital
converter and provides 24-bit pressure and temperature values, the resolution of pressure and temperature are 0.0036 kPa
and 0.01 °C, respectively, and data are transmitted via an interintegrated circuit bus interface. The conversion time is less than
1 ms.

Static calibration of the capsule.

C. Static and Dynamic Calibration of the Capsule
Because the capsule will be used at body temperature, it was
calibrated at 37–38 °C as shown in Fig. 2. The capsule was suspended near the bottom of a graduated cylindrical container,
which was placed on a hot plate (PC420D, CORNING). The
pressure data from the capsule were gathered by an Arduino
Mega board, which was connected to the tethered capsule via a
shielded cable. In the static test, the height of the water column
was set to different values via a computer-controlled plunger to
alter the pressure on the capsule. Because the small intestine
pressure is a dynamic signal, the dynamic response of the pressure measurement unit was also analyzed. In the dynamic test,
the depth of the water volume was dynamically controlled by
changing the immerged volume of the cylindrical plunger, which
was held by a tension test machine (eXpert 5601, ADMET).
Fig. 3 shows the static calibration result, which is the relationship between the actual and measured pressure applied on
the capsule by the water volume of varying height. P1 and P2
correspond to measurement unit 1 and 2, respectively, as shown
in Fig. 1(a). Based on regression fitting, the pressure calibration

Fig. 4 shows the pressure value of a typical dynamic test. The
mean dynamic error from this test is 0.0006 ± 0.011 kPa, which
is much smaller than required resolution, 0.05 kPa. The average
period of the cylinder bar’s motion is 5.1 s. The corresponding
frequency of the triangle wave is 0.19 Hz, which is close to the
average contraction frequency of the small intestine, 0.16–2 Hz
[14].

position of the plunger).

D. In Vitro Test of the Capsule
Part of our future work is to identify the position of the capsule
based on pressure signal characteristics. Different contraction
rates of the GI tract and the pressure history when the capsule
passes specific parts of the GI tract will be used as indices.
The average contraction rate of the stomach, small intestine,
and colon are 3, 10, and 4–5 times/min, respectively [17]. Also,
when a capsule passes pylorus, the valve between the stomach
and the duodenum, the pressure on the capsule will be similar
to a pulse input. In vitro tests were performed on an intestinal
simulator to verify the pressure measurement function of the
capsule.
The intestine simulator, developed in previous work [26], has
two squeezers which can move along the intestine simulating
peristalsis and other contraction modes as shown in Fig. 5(a)
and (b). The inner structure of the squeezer is responsible for
contracting and releasing the intestine based on preprogramed
physiological values.
The simulator was first used to perform a contraction rate
test. In this test, the capsule was placed in a small intestine
sample, which was excised from a living pig 12 h prior to the
experiment. Before the experiments, the tissue was submerged

allowed to rest. After closing the abdomen and gathering data
for about 10 min, the capsule was surgically removed.

in a phosphate buffered saline solution at −4 °C. The relative
location of the squeezer with respect to the capsule is shown in
Fig. 5(c). The squeezer’s inner pressure was controlled to produce physiological contraction rates of 2.5, 6, and 12 times/min.
In order to simulate the pressure response of the capsule when
it passes the pylorus, the capsule was positioned to one side
of the squeezer, then, as shown in Fig. 5(d), the squeezer was
contracted and driven by a step motor to slide over the small
intestine where the capsule was placed.

Fig. 7(a) shows data from pressure sensors 1 and 2, when
the controlled contraction rate was 6 times/min. The measured
contraction rate based on capsule output were 2.48, 6.12, and
12.32 times/min, when the contraction rate set points were 2.5,
6, and 12 times/min. Thus, the maximum relative error is 2.7%.
The ratio between the average of the peak values of P1 and P2
is 8%, which means the contraction’s influence on P2 is very
small compared to P1 .
The second test simulated the capsule passing through the pylorus. Fig. 7(b) shows the pressure when the contracted squeezer
slides over the intestine with the capsule inside the intestine. As
shown in Fig. 7(b), the pressure of sensor 1 has three phases
similar to a pulse function: rise, plateau, and decay. The plateau
time is about 3 s, which is a function of the simulator pylorus
width and capsule transit speed of 1cm/s. The pressure of sensor
unit 2 also has a similar shape; however, the average peak value
of P2 is just about 8% of P1 ’s.

E. Animal Test
The prototype tethered capsule shown in Fig. 1(d) was tested
on a 72-kg live pig model. The study was approved by the University of Nebraska’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, no. 887). Ketamine and Xylazine were used for
anesthesia in the study. The capsule was first placed in a 38 °C
water bath until the temperature of the capsule reached 38 °C
to minimize the influence of temperature variation. The capsule
was then surgically placed in the jejunum, as shown in Fig. 6. In
the data-gathering process, the pig’s abdomen was closed and

As shown in Fig. 8(a), there are some obvious low-frequency
periodic waves during the test. At the same time, there is a
higher frequency periodic background signal during the entire
test, which was induced by the respiration of the pig. Sensor
2 measures the ambient pressure. As show in Fig. 8(b), there
is only a high-frequency periodic background signal induced
by the respiration. Also note that there is a drift in P1 and P2,
which was induced by the leaking of the silicone oil in the

measurement unit shown in Fig. 1(b). Compared to the contraction process, this drift is a slow process, which is easily filtered
by the contraction analysis.
2) Frequency-Domain Analysis: Fig. 9 shows the FFT of
P1 and P2 . There is a 0.6 Hz (36 times/min) signal in P1 and
P2 . This signal is the high-frequency background signal in P1
and P2 , which was induced by the respiration of the pig, which
matches the recorded respiration rate of 34–40 times/min during
the experiment. At the same time, there are signals with 1.2, 1.8,
2.4, and 3.0 Hz, which are 2 to 5 times frequencies of the 0.6-Hz
signal. Also, there is a 1.6 Hz (96 times/min) signal in P1 and
P2 , which was induced by the heart rate of the pig and matches
the recorded heart rate of the pig of 90 to 100 times/min. There
is also a 0.18 Hz (11 times/min) signal in P1 and P2 , which
is the pressure induced by contraction of the small intestine.
In P1 , the amplitude of the contraction pressure (0.18 Hz) is
higher than the ambient pressure signal (0.6 Hz), whereas the
amplitude of the 0.18-Hz signal is smaller than the 0.6-Hz signal
in P2 . So, the contraction pressure dominates P1 , whereas the
respiration-induced pressure dominates P2 . Also, the influence
of heart rate on the small intestine contact pressure readings
is very small. Moreover, the contraction-induced pressure is
not exactly periodic. In Fig. 9(a), there are multiple peaks of
contraction pressure signals (0.16, 0.17, and 0.18 Hz).
3) Contraction Pressure Analysis: According to frequencydomain analysis, besides the contraction pressure, there were
signals induced by the respiration and heart rate in P1 . In order
to analyze the contraction pressure, the respiration- and heartrate-induced signals were removed from P1 . As discussed in
our previous work [28], the small intestine pressure processing
method shown in Fig. 10 is applied here.

Fig. 10.

Frequency-domain analysis result of pressure. (a) FFT of P1 . (b) FFT

Flowchart of the small intestine pressure processing method

First, P1 is decomposed to nine intrinsic mode functions
(IMFs). Then, FFT is applied to analyze P2 and IMFs. The
heart-rate- and respiration-induced signals and the trend in P1
are then identified. IMF1’s dominant frequencies are 1.6, 0.6,
1.2, 1.8, 2.4, and 3.0 Hz, which are the frequency of the heart
rate (1.6 Hz), the frequency of the respiration (0.6 Hz), and 2 to
5 times frequencies of the respiration. IMF2 and IMF3’s dominant frequencies are the frequency of the respiration (0.6 Hz)
and doubling frequency of the respiration (1.2 Hz). IMF9 is a
straight line, which is the trend in P1 . Finally, the contraction
pressure signal can be obtained by subtracting IMF1, IMF2,
IMF3, and IMF9 from P1 .
Fig. 11 shows the processed P1 and its FFT. The only frequency of the processed P1 is the contraction pressure signal’s
frequency, 1.8Hz. After recording every peak value and the time
of each peak in Fig. 11(a), the contraction pressure and the time
between contiguous contractions were calculated. For this study,
discrete contractions were defined as the peak value of a pulse
in processed P1 being greater than half of the average peak
value. Fig. 12(a) and (b) shows the contraction pressure and

contraction rate measurement from the in vitro test was 2.7%,
which is relatively small and allows for differentiating between
average contractions rates in humans that correspond to location
within the GI tract [15].
EMD and FFT were used to process and analyze the pressure
signals in an in vivo test. The measured contraction rate in the
animal test was about 9.4 to 11 min−1 , which is in the range of
others’ work, 9.5–12 min−1 [14], [17], [29]. The peak value of
contraction pressure was 0.24 ± 0.05 kPa, which is relatively
small [14], [15]. This could be because the animal was under
anesthesia, which decreases the small intestine’s motility [27].
The result shows that the capsule prototype can measure and
differentiate the contact pressure and ambient pressure in the GI
tract. The intimate contact between the capsule and the small
intestine lumen can be identified by evaluating the values of
the contact pressure and ambient pressure for implantation of
biosensors. Furthermore, the capsule can measure intestine contraction pressure characteristics, such as the contraction rate and
pressure when capsule passes specific parts of the GI. These
results suggest that the capsule presented in this paper, once
tetherless, can be used to study localization of the capsule in the
GI tract based on pressure signals. The pressure measurement of
the in vivo study provides an initial reference for the RC design
and a preliminary indication of contraction frequency, which is
important for evaluating GI tract motility.
Future work will add a microcontrol unit (ATMEGA2564RF4, Atmel), which has wireless communication
function, a MEMS gyroscope (MPU-9250, InvenSense), and
onboard power to the capsule. Animal tests will be performed,
and the temperature, pressure, and the capsule’s position and
orientation calculated based on gyroscope data will be gathered and wirelessly transmitted to an in vitro receiver as the
untethered, swallowable version capsule traverses the entire GI
tract. These data will be further analyzed to investigate locating
the capsule, determining the intimate contact between the capsule and the small intestine lumen based on the small intestine
contraction pressure.

the time between contiguous contractions. The mean value of
pressure peaks is 0.24 ± 0.05 kPa, and the range of peak values
is 0.16 to 0.40 kPa. The mean time between two contractions is
0.1 min, so the frequency of contraction is 0.17 Hz, which is in
the frequency range (0.16 to 0.18 Hz) in Fig. 9(a).
IV. CONCLUSION
This paper presents the design and preliminary experimental
tests of a capsule capable of measuring the contact pressure between the capsule and the small intestine lumen. After static and
dynamic calibration, in vitro and in vivo tests were performed to
verify the measurement function of the capsule. The error of the
