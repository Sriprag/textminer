Abstract—Progression of atherosclerotic process constitutes a
>
serious and quite common condition due to accumulation of fatty
materials in the arterial wall, consequently posing serious cardiovascular complications. In this paper, we assemble and analyze a
multitude of heterogeneous data in order to model the progression
of atherosclerosis (ATS) in coronary vessels. The patient’s medical record, biochemical analytes, monocyte information, adhesion
molecules, and therapy-related data comprise the input for the subsequent analysis. As indicator of coronary lesion progression, two
consecutive coronary computed tomography angiographies have
been evaluated in the same patient. To this end, a set of 39 patients
is studied using a twofold approach, namely, baseline analysis and
temporal analysis. The former approach employs baseline information in order to predict the future state of the patient (in terms
of progression of ATS). The latter is based on an approach encompassing dynamic Bayesian networks whereby snapshots of the
patient’s status over the follow-up are analyzed in order to model
the evolvement of ATS, taking into account the temporal dimension
of the disease. The quantitative assessment of our work has resulted
in 93.3% accuracy for the case of baseline analysis, and 83% overall accuracy for the temporal analysis, in terms of modeling and
predicting the evolvement of ATS. It should be noted that the application of the SMOTE algorithm for handling class imbalance
and the subsequent evaluation procedure might have introduced
an overestimation of the performance metrics, due to the employment of synthesized instances. The most prominent features found
to play a substantial role in the progression of the disease are: diabetes, cholesterol and cholesterol/HDL. Among novel markers, the
CD11b marker of leukocyte integrin complex is associated with
coronary plaque progression.

I. INTRODUCTION
THEROSCLEROSIS (ATS) is a pathological condition
affecting the arterial wall and is responsible for unfavorable clinical manifestations and mortality. ATS as a disease and
its pathophysiology have been elsewhere laid out in detail [1];
therefore, we will only briefly go through some key points. The
pathogenetic process of ATS encompasses three main processes:
1) endothelial dysfunction;
2) lipid plaque formation; and
3) atheromatic plaque formation.
To this end, several risk factors have been identified to affect
the progression of the aforementioned processes, and hence the
ATS as a whole. Traditional risk factors are diabetes, family
history, dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking habits, age, and
sex [2], [3].
In the literature, there are several studies attempting to correlate patient phenotype (e.g., age, smoking, ankle–brachial pressure index, etc.) and the development of coronary artery disease
(CAD), commonly measured using the result of the coronary
angiography procedure [4], [5]. The majority of these studies
focus on computing correlations between single features and
the angiography outcome. Moreover, patients with intermediate risk for CAD are assessed with tools such as the popular
Framingham scoring system [6] or similar risk stratification
tools [7], [8]. To this end, a similar score has been recently
developed within the HEARTCYCLE project [9].
There is also a body of research more closely related to the
objectives of our study, i.e., the use of data mining techniques
for the development of decision support systems predicting the
outcome of coronary angiography and progression of the ATS.
A recent data mining study based on a dataset of about 200
patient records [10] has the objective to classify the grade of
coronary ATS not only on the base of the commonly used features (age, sex, family history, blood tests, blood pressure, etc.),
but also on the results of pulse wave velocity. Various methods
are tested for building the classifiers and one based on decision
trees and fuzzy modeling seems to provide the most accurate
results (73% accuracy). Another interesting data mining study is
based on a dataset of 655 patients and 202 features. The dataset
contains for each patient a detailed description of the stenosis
of each of the four arteries. The study employs decision trees
and association rules to develop a decision support system for
predicting the stenosis of each individual artery [11], [12]. Decision support systems have also been primarily used for the
diagnosis of CAD by utilizing several sources of information,
such as ECG signals [13], single photon emission computed

tomography (SPECT) imaging modalities [14], heart sounds
[15], and Doppler ultrasound [16].
A number of studies exist that aim to correlate single nucleotide polymorphisms with ATS, or parameters known to
be connected with the disease in humans and animals. Reiner
et al. [17] used multiple linear regression to analyze the correlations between 25 common polymorphisms and the levels
of soluble P-selectin and carotid intima-media thickness in
young adult European American and African American populations. Timinskas et al. [18] used text mining on the abstracts
of articles available through the PubMed database. Analyses
pointed to 436 genes possibly correlated with ATS. Szymczak

et al. [19] used mutual information-based methods to analyze
a 300 kb segment on the 9p21.3 chromosome for correlations
with ATS. Three genes (ADM, FCGR3B, and ADORA1) were
identified as correlated with the disease. Stengard et al. [20]
applied the combinatorial partitioning method to investigate the
correlations between the single nucleotide polymorphisms in
the apolipoprtein E gene (APO E), with the levels of HDL
cholesterol, triglycerides, and/or total cholesterol in European
American, African American, and European populations. The
results indicate links between one pair of SNPs (560–832) and
the selected phenotypes. Yosef et al. [21] applied support vector
machines for prediction of plasma lipid levels. Pan et al. [22]

EXARCHOS et al.: MULTISCALE APPROACH FOR MODELING ATHEROSCLEROSIS PROGRESSION

described a tree-based approach to find correlations between
SNP data and phenotypes. Ten candidate genes are discovered
to have an association with the levels of HDL-C in a mouse
population.
In this study, we employ a multitude of heterogeneous data, as
well as time-varying information, aiming to identify the evolvement of ATS and its consequent manifestations, from the cellular
level up to the whole organism level. Specifically, we assemble and analyze information coming from the patient’s medical
record, biochemical analytes, adhesion molecules, monocyte
markers and therapy, with a twofold aim to: 1) identify the factors that play a key role towards the progression of ATS, and 2)
employ these factors in a decision support system in order to
conjecture about the prognosis of the disease. Hence, we are able
to gain insight into the mechanism of ATS but also to exploit
this information for monitoring the patients in a more effective
manner.

I. II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Clinical Scenario
In this paper, we consider 39 patients which have been enrolled in the IFC-CNR—“Fondazione Gabriele Monasterio” of
Pisa, after signing informed consent. These patients underwent
angiographic assessment by coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) or coronary angiography in order to evaluate
the percentage of stenosis. This assessment has been performed
on each patient in two time-slices, i.e., at the baseline visit as
well as during the follow-up (average follow-up time = 31.4 ±
17.2 months, median follow-up time = 37 months). Specifically, the patients were enrolled from November 20, 2007, to
February 16, 2012, and the follow-up ends on June 28, 2012.
Moreover, in the same time-slices, a wide series of data were
collected, namely, the patient’s medical history, relevant risk
factors, biochemical markers, therapy and monocyte markers
(see Table I).
Based on these data, we aim to identify the factors that play
a key role in the progression of coronary lesions, as assessed
by repeated CTA, and subsequently formulate an approach to
model the process of ATS evolvement. To this end, we have
employed three major outcome variables that capture the manifestations and severity of ATS; specifically, we have employed
the following variables:
1) Number of stenoses: This variable refers to the number
of inspected vessels that exhibit stenosis higher than a
critical threshold of 50%. It should be noted, however,
that this is a binary variable where patients with no critical
stenoses in any of the coronary vessels belong to one
class whereas patients with one or more vessels exhibiting
critical stenosis belong to the other class.
2) ATS progression: This is a dichotomous variable denoting
whether the number or percentage of stenosis in any of the
considered vessel sites has increased from the baseline to
the follow-up visit. Same as with the previous outcome
variable, based on the value of ATS progression, the employed patients are divided into two classes.

Fig. 1. Two major analysis axes: (a) without incorporating the temporal
dimension and (b) with the incorporation of the temporal dimension of the
disease.

3) Hybrid score: This outcome variable constitutes an extension of the severity score proposed in a previous paper
[23], where weights are attached to different ranges of
stenosis degree (see Table II), thus incorporating fuzziness to the patient characterization. The score provides an
integrated measure of number and severity of the stenosis visualized by CTA or coronary angiography. Hybrid
score assigns a severity level to a patient in the range
[0, . . . , 17], with 17 denoting the most severe condition
and 0 corresponding to a normal patient.
All the aforementioned variables reflect complementary aspects of the ATS status and progression and help us to characterize and capture effectively this complex biological process. Two
major axes comprise the analysis performed in this paper, differing in the incorporation of the disease’s temporal dimension;
these axes are shown in Fig. 1.
The steps of each type of analysis depicted in Fig. 1 are further
explained in detail in Section II-B.
B. Techniques and Algorithms
1) Class Imbalance Handling: Due to the class imbalance
that is apparent in our dataset we employ the synthetic minority
oversampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm [24] in order to
tackle with this issue; specifically, the SMOTE algorithm utilizes a k-NN approach, which oversamples the minority class
by creating new instances similar to the already available ones.
SMOTE is superior compared to other sampling-based techniques since it neither merely replicates available instances of
the minority class nor does it eliminate instances of the majority
class [24]. In this paper, both classes have been oversampled
(the majority class to a lesser extent), resulting in fully balanced

712

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. 19, NO. 2, MARCH 2015

datasets of 60 instances, where the classes are equally represented (30/30). By oversampling the majority class to a very
small extent, we slightly increase the size of the overall dataset
without affecting the quality in a significant manner. The resulting datasets are subsequently employed for the next steps of the
proposed methodology.
2) Feature Selection: Due to the large number of features
that we consider as input, we employ three feature selection algorithms, in order to identify whether there are certain features
in our feature vector that are redundant. Moreover, the employment of a feature selection algorithm results in a reduced feature
subset, thus pinpointing the key factors for each target outcome
[25], [26]. Specifically, we employ three feature selection algorithms, namely, the correlation-based feature selection (CFS)
algorithm [27], the gain ratio algorithm [28], and the Wrapper
algorithm [29]. The Wrapper algorithm is coupled with a greedy
hill-climbing search algorithm (forward selection), augmented
with a backtracking facility where the number of consecutive
nonimproving nodes allowed is 5. The CFS algorithm maintains
the features that exhibit high correlation with the class attribute
and low intercorrelation among them. Gain ratio evaluates the
input features by measuring the gain ratio with respect to the
class attribute. The Wrapper algorithm searches across all feature combinations for the minimal feature subset the yields the
highest accuracy; Wrapper is tuned with a specific classification
algorithm and, therefore, has been often reported to outperform
other feature selection techniques.
In addition, given the target outcome and the type of analysis
(i.e., within the second major analysis axis), the input features
are scrutinized with a couple of tests for statistical significance,
aiming to omit certain irrelevant attributes. To this end, we
employ the chi-square test and Fischer’s exact test.
3) Classification: The outcome of the feature selection step
is subsequently fed as input to a series of classification algorithms [28], [30] in order to explore their performance for each
outcome under consideration. Specifically, we utilize the following machine learning algorithms: Bayesian networks (BNs),
Naı̈ve Bayes (NB), artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees (DTs), and random forests (RF). BN was utilized using the TAN search
algorithm [31]; for the training of the ANN a hidden layers
were used (where a = (attributes + classes)/2), the learning
rate was 0.3 and the training time was set to 500 epochs; SVM
was run with a polynomial kernel and the following parameters: complexity parameter c = 1 and degree of the kernel =
2, for the optimization of these parameters a parameter selection algorithm [32] was utilized (which explores all possible
combinations for a set of parameters by cross-validation – CVParameterSelection algorithm from the Weka machine learning
software); DT was built using the C4.5 algorithm [33] with a
confidence factor of 0.25; RF [34] was run by constructing a
forest of ten trees.
4) Temporal Modeling: In order to perform the so called
temporal modeling of the disease, we employ an advanced data
mining algorithm, i.e., the dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs).
DBNs constitute an extension of standard Bayesian networks
and are specifically tuned to capture temporal dependencies

dependencies, the continuous lines show the intraslice dependencies and the red
arrows show the evolution.

among variables [35]. As shown in Fig. 1 (b), temporal modeling is preceded by a series of preprocessing steps (e.g., class
imbalance handling and feature selection), aiming to prepare the
input data for the subsequent DBN analysis, that constitutes the
cornerstone of temporal modeling. A provisional architecture of
a DBN is depicted in Fig. 2.
A Bayesian network is actually a directed acyclic graph,
where each node of the network corresponds to one of the
employed features. Specifically for a provisional network described as B = (G, P ), where G is a directed acyclic graph,
X = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xN }, is a set of random variables, and P is
the joint probability distribution of variables in X, factorizing
as follows:
P (X) =

N


P (xi |πG (xi ))

(1)

i=1

where πG (x) denotes the parents of x in G. A DBN is defined
as a pair DB = (B0 , Btrans ), where B0 is a BN, defining the
prior P(X0 ) and Btrans is a two-slice temporal BN (2TBN),
which defines P (X t |X t−1 ). The semantics of a DBN can be
defined by “unrolling” the 2TBN until we have T time-slices.
The resulting joint distribution is given by
P (X1 , X2 ,..., XT ) =

N
T 


P (xti |πG (xti )).

(2)

t=1 i=1

Our primary aim is to employ the training data in order to
define the architecture of the network, i.e., specify the dependencies among the variables within one time slice and across
consecutive time slices; the former dependencies are called intraslice whereas the latter interslice dependencies. For this purpose we employ two algorithms, namely, the Bayesian search
and the Peter and Clark (PC) algorithm [36], [37], for searching
across the feature space and pinpointing the network architecture that yields the best performance. After the dependencies
among all variables of the network have been defined, we may
provide new evidence to the trained model and conjecture about
the value of each variable in the network in any of the succeeding time slices. Due to the transparent architecture of the DBNs,
we are able to deduce information regarding the interactions of

EXARCHOS et al.: MULTISCALE APPROACH FOR MODELING ATHEROSCLEROSIS PROGRESSION

the variables under consideration and consequently the mechanism of the ATS procedure. Moreover, it is very important that
DBNs represent temporal causalities among the variables and,
therefore, depict a better approximation of the actual procedure
rather than a static snapshot that is possibly lacking important
temporal information.
It should be noted that prior to the utilization of the DBNs,
the input data need to be preprocessed accordingly. Specifically,
all variables must be discretized in order to be able to invoke
the training algorithms of the DBN, since they cannot be employed with continuous variables. All variables considered are
discretized using a simple approach such as the hierarchical
discretization [38] into four classes; the only exception are the
adhesion molecules, i.e., E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, which
have been discretized using clinically meaningful thresholds
[39] into three categories, denoting the status of the patient.
5) Evaluation: In terms of evaluation, we employ both tenfold cross validation as well as the leave-one-out (also called
jackknife) technique. In general, n-fold cross validation splits
the initial dataset in n stratified subsets, whereby n-1 are used
for training and the remaining one is used for testing; this procedure is repeatedly performed in a round-robin manner until
all subsets have been used exactly once for testing. Specifically,
when we perform tenfold cross validation, n = 10, whereas
in leave-one-out n equals the total number of patients considered in the dataset. Herein, we present only the results obtained
from tenfold cross validation; the respective results yielded by
leave-one-out did not exhibit any significant differences and
are therefore omitted. It should be highlighted that in every
tenfold repetition the whole process of feature selection and
training of the classifier are repeated; a similar procedure is
performed for the leave-one-out evaluation. This step is important in order to ensure that the structure of the feature selection algorithm is based exclusively on the training data and
test instances are processed by the feature selection algorithm
without changing its structure. Moreover, it should be noted
that the evaluation (both tenfold cross validation and leaveone-out) has been performed upon the fully balanced datasets
that have been produced after the application of the SMOTE
algorithm.
As for evaluation metrics, we calculate several indices in order to assess and quantify the performance of each classification
scheme; these metrics are sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), also known as precision, accuracy, Kappa
statistic, and area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve (AUC). Sensitivity quantifies the model’s ability to identify positive results (e.g., patients with ATS progression), specificity denotes the model’s ability to identify negative results
(e.g., patients without ATS progression), PPV corresponds to
the probability that a positive outcome actually reflects the underlying condition under consideration, accuracy is the overall
correctness of the model, Kappa statistic denotes the agreement
between the predicted results obtained by the model and the actual values, and AUC is commonly used measure for assessing
the performance of the model in terms of discrimination. An
AUC value of 0.5 corresponds to a random classifier and values
close to 1 denote almost optimal classification.

III. RESULTS
This section has been structured based on the two major analysis axes that have been employed within this study, namely: 1)
without incorporating the temporal dimension (baseline analysis), 2) with the incorporation of the temporal dimension of the
disease (temporal analysis); in the former analysis axis information from the baseline state of the patient is used as input
in order to predict the outcome variables in a future state, i.e.,
the follow-up visit; the latter approach constitutes a dynamic
where the predictions are recalculated when data from more
time-slices become available.
A. Baseline Analysis Results
In the tables that follow, we present the results obtained for
each outcome under consideration, i.e., number of stenoses, ATS
progression, and hybrid score, using all the employed classification schemes.
When the number of stenoses is used as target outcome, we
obtain the results shown in Table III.
In Table III, a seemingly unexpected outcome is observed,
i.e., the performance of some classifiers after the employment
of the Wrapper feature selection algorithm is slightly inferior
compared to the performance of the same classifiers when no
feature selection is employed. This is due to the fact that exhaustive search of the entire feature space, which would ensure
superior (or at least the same) results, is rather computationally
intensive and, therefore, other search algorithms are employed,
as is the greedy hill-climbing in this case.
The features maintained by each feature selection algorithm
are shown in Table IV.
Next, we consider as outcome the variable ATS progression,
and the respective results obtained are shown in Table V.
Table VI shows the features maintained by each of the utilized
feature selection algorithms. It should be noted that the performance of all classifications schemes depicted in Tables III and
V has been assessed as described in Section II-B.5, in order to
avoid any bias. However, the features presented in Tables IV
and VI correspond to feature selection performed in the entire
dataset.
As for the case when the hybrid score is used as outcome, we
calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient in order to assess
the association between the hybrid score and all employed input
variables; the reported correlation coefficient is coupled with a
p-value denoting its statistical significance (see Table VII).
Based on Table VII and setting a p-value threshold of 0.05,
only the variables hypercholesterolemia, monocytes, Ca antagonists, and hypertension (p − value = 0.051) exhibit statistically
significant correlation; however, taking into consideration the
Spearman correlation coefficient, relatively weak associations
(either positive or negative) are identified.
B. Temporal Analysis Results
Within the temporal analysis, the time dimension is introduced in order to model the ATS evolvement. First we employ
the chi-square test as well as the Fischer’s exact test in order to

omit redundant features. All features that yielded p-value either
in the chi-square test or in the Fischer’s test lower than 0.2 were
maintained for the subsequent steps of the DBN analysis. A
relatively relaxed threshold has been chosen, since the retained
features are subject to further filtering during the training of the
DBN. Subsequently, the retained features are fed as input to a
DBN which monitors the progression of ATS over the followup. Specifically, we have employed the number of stenoses and
ATS progression as indices that capture the evolvement of the
disease.
When the number of stenoses is considered as outcome, two
DBN architectures are yielded, from the Bayesian search and
the PC algorithm, respectively. Nevertheless, both algorithms
have yielded the same architecture that is shown in Fig. 3.
Based on the DBN architecture depicted in Fig. 3, we obtained
the results shown in Table VIII.
Based on Table VIII, below the column entitled “Baseline,”
the figures denote the performance achieved towards the prediction of the number of stenoses using solely information from

the baseline visit, whereas, the figures under the column entitled
“Follow-up #1” denote the performance achieved when additional information from the first baseline visit becomes available. The last row in the bottom of the table contains the overall
accuracy achieved by the model for both the aforementioned
cases, which has been calculated as the average of the respective accuracies obtained for the baseline and the follow-up visit.
Next, we employ the variable ATS progression as outcome,
and the training procedure using the Bayesian Search and the
PC algorithm have resulted in the DBN architecture of Fig. 4.
Using the aforementioned DBN architecture, we obtained the
results shown in Table IX. The same notation as in Table VIII
is used.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this paper, we have presented a series of analyses aiming to assess both qualitatively and quantitatively the prognosis
and evolvement of ATS in coronary arteries. Two major axes

comprise the methodologies utilized in this paper: 1) baseline
analysis and 2) temporal analysis. Specifically, within the former axis, we employ information acquired during the baseline
visit of the patient, which is explored using a multitude of classification schemes (feature selection algorithm coupled with a
classification algorithm) aiming to identify the most significant
features that dictate the evolvement of ATS. From the medical
point of view, this analysis best suits with the concept of “disease progression,” since cross-sectional information is used to
infer longitudinal outcomes, providing prognostic information.
In the latter axis of analysis, the temporal information, i.e., data
that are also acquired during the follow-up can be exploited, in
order to formulate a model that accounts for the time-dependent
component of the disease. This analysis allows to link clinical
and biological features collected during follow-ups with disease
evolution, still a relevant approach from the prognostic point,
but limited by the need to collect features during time.
As stated in the description of the clinical scenario, data from
each patient are acquired in two visits, once in the baseline and
once during the follow-up. However, the timing of the latter
visit varies significantly across the patients. To this end, we
have unified all follow-up visits into a single time-slice roughly
denoting the future state of the patient. Subsequently, we are
able to incorporate information from this follow-up visit in both
our analyses in order to assess the progression of ATS in the
time following the baseline visit and, thus, assess the prognosis
of the disease.

For the case of baseline analysis, we present in Table X the
best-performing classification schemes regarding the number of
stenoses and ATS progression that constitute two major outcomes under consideration.
It should be noted that for both the aforementioned outcomes,
i.e., number of stenoses and ATS progression, the Naı̈ve Bayes
classification algorithm has yielded the highest performance.
This is specifically important because the Naı̈ve Bayes algorithm exhibits considerable interpretability compared to other
classification algorithms, and is therefore quite suitable and appealing from a medical standpoint as well.
Based on Tables III and V, we observe that all classification schemes have yielded acceptable results, and in some cases
the results obtained are higher than 90%. It is also quite encouraging that all metrics are quite high, especially for the
best-performing schemes shown in Table X, thus denoting the
stability of the reported models, despite the relatively small
dataset used for the analysis. It should be noted that the application of the SMOTE algorithm for increasing the instances
of the minority class and the subsequent evaluation procedure
might introduce an overestimation of the performance metrics,
due to the employment of synthesized instances. As for the
outcome variable number of stenoses, we observe that feature
selection has considerable ameliorated the obtained results, especially the Gain and the Wrapper feature selection algorithms.
The classification schemes that exhibited quite high results but
nevertheless inferior compared to the best-performing one are

the gain algorithm coupled with either an ANN or an SVM, as
well as the Wrapper coupled with an SVM. In any case, the
Naı̈ve Bayes classifier that constitutes the best-performing classification scheme is more appealing since it operates in a more
transparent manner compared to the “black-box” architecture of
ANN and SVM. For the outcome variable ATS progression, an
overall similar performance is observed, i.e., all classification
schemes have yielded acceptable results. More specifically, the
coupling of CFS algorithm for feature selection with the Naı̈ve
Bayes classifier, which comprise the best-performing scheme
have resulted 93.3% accuracy, and equally high values for the
other metrics. Of all the examined classification schemes only
a few have exhibited slightly inferior performance compared
to the rest, e.g., DT without performing feature selection, the
gain algorithm coupled with either an SVM or a DT. In terms
of feature selection, Wrapper and CFS have resulted in feature
vectors with good performance, and specifically, the following classification schemes are among the best-performing ones:
Wrapper with BN, NB, or SVM, as well as CFS with ANN.
Same as before, the best-performing classification scheme, i.e.,
CFS coupled with NB, not only exhibits the highest performance but also features a transparent architecture which is very
important from a medical point of view.
As for the third outcome variable, i.e., hybrid score, statistically significant correlations were reported only with hypercholesterolemia, monocytes, Ca antagonists, and hypertension;
nevertheless, the respective correlations were quite low, thus
preventing us from attaching too much importance to the gained
results.
The features pinpointed as most significant for all analyses
pertaining to baseline analysis are summarized in Table XI.
As shown in Table XI, especially as regards to the outcomes

clinical variables, coupled with risk factors, adhesion molecules,
and treatment information, correctly predicts coronary ATS progression, an interesting information for clinical decision making
(e.g., anticipation of a ECG stress test or an imaging test). The
majority of these features, separately taken, are known to play a
role in promoting endothelial dysfunction and eventually plaque
formation. However, it is not yet clarified its combined role in
favoring progression of existing plaques. While suppression or
treatment of risk factors is the key management for prevention
of disease evolution, according to the current guidelines, presence of the above list of features prompts clinician to activate
more aggressive monitoring of the coronary function in patients
with these clinical presentations at the first observation.
Based on the findings of Table XI, the majority of the variables
pinpointed have been found in the literature to play an important role in the progression of ATS. Since the employed dataset
is relatively limited, this result is very encouraging because it
denotes that our patient set is representative and, therefore, our
corollaries are on the right track, even though further validation is needed. Direct comparison with other similar approaches
presented in the literature cannot be performed due to the employment of different datasets but more importantly because
of the outcome variables that we have used. However, from a
qualitative point of view, in this study we have assembled and
analyzed a wide range of features, including biochemical analytes, adhesion molecules, and markers of monocyte activation,
besides the standard clinical information.
The temporal analysis has resulted in two DBN models specifically tuned to monitor the evolvement of ATS, based on the two
time-varying indices we have employed: number of stenoses
and ATS progression; the respective results yielded are shown
in Table XII.
The purpose of the temporal analysis is to exploit additional
information from what has been obtained at some point within
the follow-up period of each patient, besides the information at
the time of diagnosis (i.e., baseline information). Our aim is to
model the progression of the disease as it evolves over time, in
order to formulate a model that captures certain manifestation
of the disease. The manifestations that are under consideration
in the temporal analysis are the number of stenoses and ATS
progression.

718

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. 19, NO. 2, MARCH 2015

As clinically expected, when the number of stenoses was
used as clinical manifestation, Bayesian search and PC provided satisfactory accuracy (87% for both algorithms) when additional information from the first baseline visit becomes available (follow-up features). Features qualifying the DBN were diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, cholesterol/high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, and glucose. Conversely, the use of
baseline features alone provided a moderate accuracy in the prediction of the number of stenoses (72%). A similar increase in
accuracy was also observed when the outcome ATS progression
was considered; specifically, there was a slight increase in accuracy (by 2%) when the first follow-up visit was considered
besides baseline information. The features maintained in this
case were: diabetes, low density lipoprotein (LDL), infarct site,
creatinine, creatinine clearance, monocytes, cholesterol/LDL,
white blood cells (WBC), and smoke.
Consequently, we have come down to a set of models that
capture and predict the progression of ATS, taking into account
a large set of parameters; this multitude of input variables encompassing clinical, biochemical, medication as well as several
other aspects of the disease constitutes a crucial novelty of our
dataset. In order to further verify and validate our results, it is
important to perform similar analyses in larger populations of
patients that can support more solidified conclusions. The issue
of data availability constitutes a major limitation in all clinically
oriented studies; this is also the case in this study, especially
given the large number of features that have been initially considered in the formulation of the datasets.
Another important issue that should be raised is the unification
of all follow-up visits into a single time-slice, which leads to
loss of information. Admittedly, taking into account the specific
time interval of each follow-up visit and consequently attaching
a relative timing to each prediction would be very interesting
from a technical and clinical standpoint. Nevertheless, given the
number of patients and the variability of the follow-up time,
incorporating the time dimension would lead to very complex
classification task and poor performance.
The interpretability of the obtained results should also be
considered, i.e., all derived outcomes need to be comprehended
by the medical community in order to trust them and also benefit
from them. Of course, the obtained results need to be rather high
for all metrics considered (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
PPV, etc). Here, we have made a considerable effort in order
to procure classification schemes that yield acceptable results
but also preserve physical meaning and interpretability by the
medical experts.
V. CONCLUSION
We have presented a systematic approach encompassing heterogeneous data, aiming to assess the progression of ATS in
coronary vessels. Specifically, we have assembled a wide scale
of information coming from the patient’s medical record, biochemical analytes, monocytes, adhesion molecules, and the respective therapy, in order to embrace all possible manifestations
of the disease. Using the aforementioned information, we have
utilized a twofold approach: 1) baseline analysis and 2) temporal

analysis, based on the incorporation of the time dimension. Conclusively, we have come down to a limited number of models
that are able to model the progression of ATS with considerable
accuracy. The factors that have been found to affect substantially the prognosis of the disease either in the baseline or in
the temporal analysis are: diabetes, cholesterol and the cholesterol/HDL ratio, which is in accordance with the literature.
It is important that the corollaries extracted within this paper are further verified and reinforced with richer datasets, in
order to achieve enhanced generalization capability. Moreover,
a methodologically similar approach could be applied for the
monitoring of the disease progression of carotid arteries, either independently or in conjunction with the hereby presented
models, thus resulting in a more unified and complete approach.
