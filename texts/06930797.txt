Abstract—A first approach to a portable and compact device
for point-of-care (PoC) early instantaneous detection of anemia
is described. This device works directly with whole blood samples relying on hematocrit analysis by means of impedance analysis. This device consists of a custom electronic instrumentation,
postprocessing software and plug-and-play disposable sensor. The
designed electronics are connected to a remote computer, which
allows control of the instrumentation and results displaying with
a user friendly software panel. The disposable sensor is based on
a low-cost label-free three gold electrode commercial sensor for
50-μL volume samples. Forty-eight whole blood samples, randomly collected from hospitalized patients in Hospital Clı́nic, were
used to validate the device capability for anemia detection. Whole
blood samples were distributed in two groups: 10 samples for system calibration, and 38 samples for system validation. To calibrate
the device, a complete EIS experiment has been performed to get a
full impedance spectrum analysis, defining an accurate frequency
working range for hematocrit detection. Afterward, we developed
a protocol for instant impedance detection to determine the system
detection accuracy, sensitivity, and coefficient of variation. As a
result, impedance variations between different samples have been
detected with less than 2% accuracy error for both impedance
magnitude and phase. A hematocrit detection algorithm, relying
on impedance analysis, has been developed based on the previous
studies. The response, effectiveness, and robustness of the portable
PoC device to detect anemia have been proved with an accuracy
error of 1.75% and a coefficient of variation of less than 5%.
Index Terms—Anemia, electronics, hematocrit, impedance analysis, point-of-care (PoC), whole blood.

I. INTRODUCTION
HE World Health Organization (WHO) defines anemia as
the stage at which the amount of hemoglobin in blood
drops below a certain WHO threshold for specified population
groups, being considered a worldwide problem associated with
many factors [1]. According to the WHO, 1.62 billion people,
which correspond to 24.8% of the global population, are affected
by anemia [2]. Measurement of Hb concentration is considered the most reliable anemia indicator and it is widely utilized

in national demographic health surveys and by national govern-ments surveying populations [1]. Also, evaluation of the Hb
concentration in possible blood donors is a required condition
in most countries to prevent blood collection from a donor with
significant anemia being, generally, the only laboratory control
test performed before donation [3]. Blood donation is the only
source of support to patients who require blood transfusion but,
on the other hand, frequent donations may lead to iron deficiency
in blood donors, especially females [4]. Hb is an iron-containing
protein responsible for transporting oxygen in the blood and it
is the main component of red blood cells (RBCs). Hematocrit is
the proportion of blood volume occu-pied by RBCs and is determined by cell number and size, so hematocrit numbers below
a certain reference range may indicate anemia or abnormal cell
development [5], [6].
New noninvasive methods are being studied and developed
for Hb screening but have been demonstrated to have lower precision and sensitivity level [3]. These different factors are drivers
for the development of point-of-care (PoC) anemia equipment
providing an easy to use, reliable and sensitive test with a short
response time in a portable device relying on 50-μL blood sample, which can be capillary collected by standard medical procedures [7], providing reduced disposition decision time [8] and
replacing current venipuncture based laboratory test and improving patient satisfaction [9]. Moreover, low volume blood
samples analysis represents a means of avoiding inducing anemia or making it worse, as phlebotomy is reported to induce
anemia in hospitalized patients [10].
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique is
reported as an effective solution to characterize the electrical
properties of cells and their behavior, as well as the sensing
systems and the buffer media being used to explore new methods
of monitoring and characterization [11], [12]. Considering that
EIS technique is related to electrical properties of all kinds of
particles, it is applied in many biological fields and is especially
useful in lab-on-a-chip (LoC) and point-of-care (PoC) devices.
Since one major anemia indicator, hematocrit, consists of RBC
suspended in plasma, it can be accurately monitored by means of
its electrical impedance or bioimpedance [11], [13]–[16]. Other
studies, involving blood impedance analysis, are reported, as
[17] where two- and four-electrode topologies are compared to
characterize blood impedance on the frequency range of 100 Hz
to 100 MHz. Or [18] where the impedance variations associated
to laminar blood flow are studied.
In order to proceed with EIS method, two different approaches
have been considered: the fast Fourier transform (FFT) [19]
method and the frequency response analyzer (FRA) [20]. In the

case of the FFT a pulse, ideally a Dirac function, is applied to
the sample provided that it contains a wide enough frequency
content to get a full spectrum response. Then, the sensor system
response is digitalized and processed in a digital processor and,
using the FFT algorithm, different frequency components are
obtained for their analysis [19]. Although this method appears to
be simple, there are several problems in its implementation. First
and foremost, it is very difficult to generate a fast step function
and a very fast electronic instrumentation capable of driving
this step on the electrodes and extracting the resulting signal
and, in addition, being sensitive without the resulting frequency
components being distorted. Since the important information
is contained in a short period of time after the step is applied,
in addition to a very fast electronic instrumentation, a very
fast analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a high precision bit
resolution is also required, resulting in a high-speed hardware
and heavy algorithm implementation device. Considering the
PoC characteristics of the device, the FRA approach seems to be
the simpler and more efficient solution. In this case a reference
signal is adopted and by means of a lock-in amplifier (LIA)
the Bode plot of the sensor measurement signal is obtained.
The FRA solution is a good solution in terms of the tradeoff between speed and complexity, particularly if not too low
frequencies need to be measured: above 10 Hz in whole blood
hematocrit EIS experiments [14], [16].
Currently, commercial bench top and nonspecific huge laboratory devices are utilized for EIS based applications, involving complex experimental setups and significant expenditure of
time. Furthermore, whole blood PoC specific sensing systems
also rely on complex microfluidic devices [21], [22] entailing
a low environmental integration-level to develop autonomous
PoC applications [23].
In this paper, a compact and portable PoC solution, for early
detection of anemia through whole blood hematocrit monitoring
is studied. The system is composed of a portable electronic
device, which allows real-time data acquisition and control by
means of an external computer, and a plug and play low-cost
disposable commercial sensor. This sensor is based on three
screen printed electrodes for an envisaged sample of 50 μL
without involving any microfluidic implementation.
To validate the anemia early detection system, 48 different
blood samples have been studied. These samples were randomly obtained from hospitalized patients in Hospital Clı́nic.
First of all, whole blood samples were distributed in two different groups: the first one (group I), has been used for system
calibration, and the second one (group II) has been used for system validation. With group I whole blood samples, we measured
a complete impedance spectrum to define a frequency working
range, where measured impedance values are well differentiated
and related to the blood sample hematocrit. Afterward, we defined a protocol for instant impedance detection on the defined
working range, and we studied the relation between impedance
measurements and whole blood samples hematocrit. With these
studies we have found the detection resolution and system sensitivity and we have calibrated the system for an instantaneous
hematocrit detection. Finally, the hematocrit detection algorithm, based on previous calibration, has been implemented

709

and validated through group II whole blood samples randomly
obtained. Impedance analysis measurements were performed at
alternating biasing voltage of 10 mVrm s , in order to prevent
undesired effects like electroporation or irreversible electrical
breakdown, which will damage blood cells membranes [24].
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Hematocrit, Electrodes, and Impedance Measurement
Biological impedance (ZCELL ) is defined by Ohm’s law [25],
being the current response (ICELL ) to applying an alternating
voltage signal (VCELL ) to a biological material by its corresponding sensing system (1):
ZCELL = VCELL /ICELL .

(1)

Two electrodes is the basic sensor topology defined by the
working electrode (WE), where VCELL is applied, and the auxiliary electrode (AE), which tracks VCELL and supplies ICELL .
However, this topology entails some problematic behavior related to VCELL signal distortion due to the AE polarization
effects. In order to avoid this effect, the current is supplied using an extra, third, electrode [see Fig. 1(a)]. A three electrode
sensor is also a commonly used configuration on blood characterization [15], [16] and is defined as: a) the working electrode
(WE), where VCELL is applied, b) the reference electrode (RE),
which tracks VCELL and c) the counter or auxiliary electrode
(CE), which supplies ICELL .
In Fig. 1(a) the electrical model for dilute cell suspensions in
a three-electrode sensor is shown, which can be described as an
electrical components network [26]. ICELL can flow through an
external cellular path (RE resistance) or across the cell membrane (RM CM ) and go through the intra-cellular medium (RI
resistance). Since RM resistance is nearly negligible [27], a simplified model for the sample impedance (ZCELL ) is considered
in (2):
ZCELL = RE (1 + jωCM RI )/(1 + jωCM (RE + RI )). (2)
Considering this electrical cell model, the close relation
between hematocrit and impedance at low frequencies (up
to 100 kHz) has been confirmed [28], as will be shown in
Section III. At this frequency range the response current ICELL
flow outside the RBCs across RE impedance. Hematocrit increment makes the current flow path larger between the reference and working electrodes, becoming an increment on ZCELL
impedance due to an increment of RE impedance [see Fig. 1(b)].
This phenomenon occurs at the 10 Hz to 100 kHz frequency
range [14]. As the impedance measurement depends on the
quantity of RBCs in the sample, we used the impedance measurement of whole blood plasma as a reference value, so as to
be able to determine the hematocrit according to the impedance
increment to that reference value. This relationship between
impedance and RBCs will be studied in Section III.
B. Sensor
As previously stated, the sensing system is based on a
low-cost disposable commercial sensor without involving any

micro-fluidic implementation. Moreover, it must be easy to
manipulate by clinical laboratory technicians using standard
clinical laboratory tools. Additionally, the sensing system must
work with 50-μL blood samples, the standard volume for a
whole blood drop and easily collected by capillarity [7], and
must be made of gold, an acknowledged bio-compatible material. Different commercial sensors have been evaluated, such as
AC1 sensor (BVT Technologies, Brno, Czech Republic) or the
G-AUG sensor series (Bio-Logic SAS, Claix, France), and the
commercial sensor that best meets the defined specifications
is the C223AT. This sensor has screen-printed electrodes of
1.6-mm diameter based on gold and is specifically designed to
work with 50-μL samples [see Fig. 1(c)].
The device has a plug-and-play sensor system inside a
Faraday cage and it is connected to the electronics with a custom
made three wire coaxial insulated cable in order to provide an
easy to use setup and reliable performance. Blood samples were
put on top of the sensor with an automatic pipette (Labopette
Manual 10–100 μL; Hirschmann Laborgeräte, Eberstadt,
Germany).
C. Blood Samples
We used 48 whole blood samples obtained from hospitalized
patients in Hospital Clı́nic. However, personal data of the patients was not available to the investigators and samples were
randomly selected. Whole blood samples were obtained in 4-mL
tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA
R
; BD, Madrid, Spain). We performed a
7.2 mg; BD Vacutainer
complete blood count (CBC) of the blood samples with a hematology analyser (Advia 2120, Siemens AG, Madrid, Spain),
which reported the hemoglobin and hematocrit results as g/dL
and percentage (%), respectively. With this methodology, whole
blood is aspirated into the system, the sample stream is split,
one portion is used for hemoglobinometry and one portion is

used for RBC counting and size. Hemoglobinometry is based
on RBC lysis and measurement of hemoglobin concentration
by absorbance of spectrophotometry. RBC counting and size
analyses are performed by passing the RBCs singly through
a small direct current. The temporary increase in impedance
caused by the passage of the cell provides information about
RBC number and RBC volume. Hematocrit is calculated from
the measured RBC number and volume [29].
These 48 whole blood samples were distributed in two different groups [see Fig. 1(d)]. The first one (group I), composed of
10 samples, was used to calibrate the system, whereas the second one (group II), composed of the other randomly collected
38 whole blood samples, was used to validate the whole system
performance.
The samples in group I have been selected to cover the entire
possible hematocrit range present in human blood. Therefore,
the obtained hematocrit [HCT(%)], hemoglobin [Hb (g/dL)] and
anemia diagnosis for the different blood samples in group I was
as shown in Table I:

D. System Description
A full custom electronic circuit was specifically designed
to carry out the FRA approach with a three electrode sensor
topology. The device architecture has two modules: a) an electrodes biasing and instrumentation module [see EBI in Fig. 2(a)]
which provides a frequency configurable voltage signal and an
instrumentation amplifier based potentiostat; and b) a signal digitalization and postprocessing module [see SDPP in Fig. 2(a)],
which adapts both signals needed for the FRA analysis, reference signal [see VRS in Fig. 2(a)] and measurement signal [see
VIS in Fig. 2(a)], from a bi-polar single-ended to an uni-polar
differential signal to be processed by a 12-bit parallel output
analog-to-digital converter. Finally, a digital lock-in amplifier
(DLIA) carries out the FRA approach that provides the Bode
diagrams for both impedance magnitude and phase.
The first module (EBI), electrodes biasing and instrumentation, is based on a signal generator, OSC in Fig. 2(a) (AD9833;
Analog Devices, Norwood, USA), and an instrumentation amplifier based potentiostat. The signal generator provides a stable voltage signal with a wide variable frequency range, 0
to 12.5 MHz, which is controlled by an SPI communication
protocol. The instrumentation is based on a potentiostat with
an instrumentation amplifier current readout stage [30], [31],
which consists of an operational amplifier to bias the sensor
and an instrumentation amplifier as an electrode current readout. The operational amplifier, OA in Fig. 2(a) (AD825; Analog
Devices, Norwood, USA), is a dual supply high-speed JFET
amplifier with low leakage current and low distortion capable
of high-output driving, which tracks the signal on to the electrodes. The instrumentation amplifier, IA in Fig. 2(a) (AD8421;
Analog Devices, Norwood, USA), is a dual supply high-speed

711

instrumentation amplifier with low noise and ultralow bias current. The instrumentation amplifier converts the current through
the electrodes (3) into a voltage signal (VIS ) by means of a sensing resistor on the counter electrode [see RSENSE in Fig. 2(a)]
between the amplifier’s noninverting and inverting inputs (4).
The amplifier’s gain has been set to 1 in order to optimize the
amplifier’s total harmonic distortion (THD) [30]:
ICELL = VRS /ZCELL

(3)

VIS = (V+ − V− ) = RSENSE ICELL
= VRS (RSENSE /ZCELL )
ZCELL = RSENSE (VRS /VIS ).

(4)
(5)

This stage has been designed with four different multiplexed
sensing resistors (RSENSE ) taking into account the expected
impedance values shown in the literature between 100 Ω and
100 kΩ [12], [15], [16], [32], [33], as was subsequently confirmed in the system validation experiments. These resistors are
automatically multiplexed with an auto-scale function that will
be explained later.
The second module SDPP consists in a 12-bit dual, low power
ADC, ADC in Fig. 2(a) (ADC12D040; Texas Instruments,
Dallas, USA), capable of converting both analog input signals
at 40 MSPS simultaneously. A 12-bit resolution does not represent a significant drawback in the final system resolution, as
VRS is scaled to the full range ADC analog input and the system
provides a real-time gain auto-scale for the RSENSE gain factor.
The analog inputs are converted from single ended to differential with a differential amplifier, DA in Fig. 2(a) (AD8138;
Analog Devices, Norwood, USA), with a high slew rate with
low distortion and input noise. Finally, a DLIA based on realtime mathematical processing [30] is embedded on a 400MHz microprocessor from a real-time platform, sbRIO 9632
in Fig. 2(a) (sbRIO9632; National Instruments, Austin, USA).
Final impedance Bode plot is composed of sample impedance
magnitude |ZCELL | (6) and impedance phase ϕCELL (7), where
VREAL (8) and VIM (9) stand for real part and imaginary part of
the measured impedance:

In addition, real-time platform sbRIO9632 has an FPGA
(Xilinx Spartan-3; Xilinx, San Jose, USA), which allows us to
provide steady clock signals as needed on the instrumentation
that can be automatically real-time adjusted, allowing complete
parallel signal acquisition for all the frequency ranges. Furthermore, embedded hardware control, like RSENSE multiplexed
auto-scale and signal generator automatic frequency sweep can
be developed. This real-time embedded hardware control represents the basic features for an automated and complete FRA
approach.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. System Calibration: EIS Hematocrit Analysis

The real-time platform allows the system configuration and
data display, with a user-friendly front-end user panel, by means
of an external computer connected to the platform with a standard Ethernet connection. The user panel, depicted in Fig. 3, has
two different configurations that can be selected from a menu (A
label). Each option allows the system to perform different experiments when the start button (D label) key is pressed. The first
one is a complete EIS that provides the Bode diagrams for both
impedance magnitude (F label) and phase (G label), where the
user could choose the number of points per decade (C label).
EIS frequency ranges are fixed to the defined bandwidth on

The designed device was validated through EIS experiences
with the specified sensor described in Section II-B for each
whole blood sample described in Section II-C. Experimental
setup is depicted in Fig. 2(c). All the measurements have been
performed at clinical laboratory room temperature.
First of all, we measured a complete impedance spectrum for
the group I whole blood samples. Fig. 4 shows the obtained
impedance magnitude [see Fig. 4(a)] and phase [see Fig. 4(b)]
Bode diagram for whole blood samples. We observed that, both
in impedance magnitude and phase, there exists a difference
between impedance results for different samples in specific frequency ranges. Furthermore, these differences must be related to

whole blood hematocrit, as the response current ICELL flow outside the RBCs, as introduced in Section II-A. When hematocrit
is higher, the current flow path becomes larger between the reference and working electrodes, which represents an increment on
measured ZCELL impedance. Therefore, measured impedance
differences must be defined as impedance increments related
to hematocrit increments. However, this phenomenon is not
present on the whole frequency range defined on Section II-A,
10 Hz to 100 kHz, but on a more specific one. So, we have
defined working ranges depending on the correlation between
impedance measurement and hematocrit. In terms of impedance
magnitude [see Fig. 4(c)] the frequency working range is in the
10–100 kHz range and for impedance phase [see Fig. 4(d)] it is
in 1–5 kHz range.
It is interesting to be able to determine impedance magnitude and phase differences for different hematocrit samples on
a wide frequency working range. It gives flexibility and data
redundancy to the system as long as it is not single frequency
response dependent, which makes simple statistical data analysis techniques, such as linear fit, feasible, turning out to be a
more robust and reliable device.

Hence, once we have assumed that measured impedance increments, on the defined frequency working range, are related
to blood samples hematocrit increment, we must determine
the system’s capacity for hematocrit detection, resolution, and
sensitivity.
B. System Calibration: Automatic Hematocrit Detection
In this section, linear fit technique has been used to study
the relation between impedance data collected and whole blood
samples hematocrit, as we have assumed a linear dependence
between them. With this study we want to determine the system hematocrit detection accuracy, sensitivity, and coefficient of
variation. We have implemented a software, embedded on the
microprocessor from the real-time platform sbRIO 9632, to instantly measure impedance on the previously defined frequency
working range. As a first approach to the detection system,
only the impedance magnitude measurements will be evaluated. Although impedance phase measurements may be related
to hematocrit, as it is shown in Fig. 4(d), these values, unlike
the impedance magnitude, are strongly frequency dependent,

The hematocrit detection system has a 10.46 Ω/% sensitivity
and a 1.13% accuracy error with a linear correlation of 0.987.
Precision can be evaluated with the coefficient of variation (CV),
which is the standard deviation (SD) divided by the mean value
of the five repetitions. The CV of the system is acceptable as it
is normally below 5%.

so more complex data analysis is needed, resulting in a more
complex and slower system. To calibrate the system, the
impedance magnitude measurements of the whole blood samples from group I will be compared with the hematocrit values
[HCT (%)]. Five repetitions have been done for each whole
blood sample using different sensors and subsamples from the
original sample. Table III shows the impedance magnitude values, the standard deviation and coefficient of variation for each
whole blood sample.
The relation of impedance magnitude (|Z|) mean value and
whole blood samples hematocrit had been analyzed as a linear
dependence approach (10), where the slope (β Z ) defines the
sensitivity, in terms of ohms per hematocrit percentage (Ω/%).
Meanwhile the hematocrit detection accuracy (%) is the relation between the linear fit standard deviation and β Z . Precision
can be evaluated with the coefficient of variation: that is, the
standard deviation divided by the mean value of the five repetitions measurements. In Fig. 5 the impedance magnitude for the
different hematocrit [HCT (%)] is depicted:
|Z| (Ω) = αZ + βZ HCT(%).

(10)

In previous sections, we have analyzed the hematocrit [HCT
(%)] relation with impedance measurement, in both magnitude
and phase, defining the frequency working range. An embedded
software has been developed to instantly measure impedance
magnitude on the defined working range, and we have studied the sensitivity, accuracy, and coefficient of variation of the
device. With the data from these previous studies, we have implemented an automatic real-time anemia detection device that
provides instantaneous hematocrit [HCT (%)] measurement. An
HCT (%) evaluation algorithm, based on impedance magnitude
measurement, has been embedded on the microprocessor from
the real-time platform sbRIO 9632. The accuracy, precision, and
repeatability of the detection device will be evaluated using 38
whole blood samples from the validation group, described in
Section II-C (group II), which were randomly collected. Five
repetitions have been done for each whole blood sample, using
different sensors and subsamples, to evaluate the precision of
the device.
The predicted hematocrit from the detection device (DHCT
(%) in Table IV) is the mean value of the five measurements
performed with each whole blood sample, and it was compared
with the hematocrit measurement (CHCT (%) in Table IV) of
the CBC performed with the hematology analyser (Advia 2120,
Siemens AG, Madrid, Spain). Hematocrit measurement and its
standard deviation (SD) results are depicted in Table IV.

hematocrit calculated with a clinical hematology analyser

is shown. The proposed device presented great accuracy in detecting hematocrit, with a linearity of 0.93 and an accuracy error
of 1.75% with a correlation of 0.98. The coefficient of variation
has a mean value of 3.27% for the whole samples, without any
particular case above 5%. In quality control procedures in clinical hematology measurements, coefficient of variation of less
than 5% for a test is considered acceptable [29].
As a first approach, which only contemplates impedance magnitude to a hematocrit analysis algorithm for anemia detection,
as previously stated, it would be interesting to develop a more
complex algorithm involving both impedance magnitude and
phase on a wide frequency working range, for more precision
and better performance on detection.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a first approach to a novel PoC device has
been designed, fabricated, and tested for instantaneous anemia
detection based on custom instrumentation electronics, electrical impedance spectroscopy technique, and disposable sensor
without any microfluidic. The system performs real-time instrumentation control, data acquisition, and results display by
means of an external computer and user-friendly software. The
device has been proved to exhibit reliable, robust, and effective
results using label-free disposable commercial sensors using
50-μL whole blood samples. Furthermore, unlike actual clinical equipment for blood analysis, whole blood samples are not
destroyed in the measurement process.
Forty-eight whole blood samples, randomly collected from
hospitalized patients in Hospital Clı́nic, were used to demonstrate the feasibility of the impedance measurement technique
to perform an easy, fast, and sensitive hematocrit study using
disposable label-free commercial sensors with low-voltage biasing. A first approach for a hematocrit evaluation algorithm for
anemia detection, based on whole blood impedance analysis, is

presented and validated. The system has been evaluated through
comparison with CBC using a clinical hematology analyser
(Advia 2120, Siemens AG, Madrid, Spain). The anemia detection device has a linearity of 0.93 and an accuracy error of 1.75%
with a correlation of 0.98. Coefficient of variation is below 5%,
with a worst case resolution of 1.63%. Considering this as a first
approach algorithm for anemia detection, the development of
a more complex algorithm and a more accurate clinical assay
with higher testing population will lead to more accurate results
to assess the device performance. Additionally, as the system
is based on straightforward standards on instrumentation electronics and sensing, it represents an economic, portable, safe
and reliable system of anemia detection with a high degree of
integration for the clinical environment.
Further development must be considered for future stages:
real-time platform sbRIO9632 (National Instruments) has been
used for fast software prototype development and versatility,
but it is a major drawback in terms of power consumption, size,
and price. It must be replaced by a low-cost microcontroller for
instrumentation control, data acquisition, and postprocessing.
All the future system improvements must push toward the development of a truly autonomous, portable, and versatile device
relying on the presented work.
Commercial devices for PoC anemia detection, based on microfluidics devices, such as AnemiaCheck (Express Diagnostics, Blue Earth, MN, USA), or on photometry hemoglobin
detection, such as STAT-Site (Stanbio Laboratory, Boerne, TX,
USA) or HemoPoint H2 (Alere, Waltham, MA, USA), are much
slower presenting similar detection performance results, Table V. Moreover, getting digitalized information provides the
possibility of remote care, monitoring, and implementation of
other clinical actuators. Other commercial PoC devices, like the
i-STAT analyzer (Abbott Point of Care, Princeton, NJ, USA),
despite providing lab-quality results for patient PoC testing,
turn out to be less specific involving a much more expensive
and slower device.
In summary, this paper describes the design, development,
and testing of a novel instantaneous anemia detection PoC device with low-cost disposable commercial sensors and instrumentation electronics. The device presents reliable, sensitive,
and robust hematocrit detection, relying on low-cost straightforward electronic equipment and sensing systems.
