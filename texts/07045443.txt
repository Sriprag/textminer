Predicting Asthma-Related Emergency Department
Visits Using Big Data
Sudha Ram, Member, IEEE, Wenli Zhang, Max Williams, and Yolande Pengetnze

Abstract—Asthma is one of the most prevalent and costly chronic
conditions in the United States, which cannot be cured. However,
accurate and timely surveillance data could allow for timely and
targeted interventions at the community or individual level. Current national asthma disease surveillance systems can have data
availability lags of up to two weeks. Rapid progress has been made
in gathering nontraditional, digital information to perform disease
surveillance. We introduce a novel method of using multiple data
sources for predicting the number of asthma-related emergency
department (ED) visits in a specific area. Twitter data, Google
search interests, and environmental sensor data were collected for
this purpose. Our preliminary findings show that our model can
predict the number of asthma ED visits based on near-real-time
environmental and social media data with approximately 70% precision. The results can be helpful for public health surveillance, ED
preparedness, and targeted patient interventions.
Index Terms—Asthma, big data, emergency department (ED)
visits, environmental sensors, predictive modeling, social media.

I. INTRODUCTION
STHMA is one of the most prevalent and costly chronic
conditions in the United States, with 25 million people
affected [1]. Asthma accounts for about two million emergency
department (ED) visits, half a million hospitalizations, and 3 500
deaths [1], and incurs more than 50 billion dollars in direct medical costs annually [2]. Moreover, asthma is a leading cause of
loss productivity with nearly 11 million missed school days
and more than 14 million missed work days every year due to
asthma [1]. Although asthma cannot be cured, many of its adverse events can be prevented by appropriate medication use
and avoidance of environmental triggers [3]. The prediction of
population- and individual-level risk for asthma adverse events
using accurate and timely surveillance data could guide timely
and targeted interventions, to reduce the societal burden of
asthma.

At the population level, current national asthma disease
surveillance programs rely on weekly reports to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of data collected from
various local resources by state health departments [4]. Notoriously, such data have a lag time of weeks, therefore, providing
retrospective information that is not amenable to proactive and
timely preventive interventions. At the individual level, known
predictors of asthma ED visits and hospitalizations include past
acute care utilization, medication use, and sociodemographic
characteristics [5]–[7]. Common data sources for these variables include electronic medical records (EMR), medical insurance claims data, and population surveys, all of which, also,
are subject to significant time lag. In an ongoing quality improvement project for asthma care, Parkland Center for Clinical
Innovation (PCCI), Dallas, TX, USA, researchers have built
an asthma predictive model relying on a combination of EMR
and claim data to predict the risk for asthma-related ED visits within three months of data collection [Unpublished reports
from PCCI]. Although the model performance (C-statistic 72%)
and prediction timeframe (three months) are satisfying, a narrower prediction timeframe potentially could provide additional
risk-stratification for more efficiency and timeliness in resource
deployment. For instance, resources might be prioritized to first
serve patients at high risk for an asthma ED visit within two
weeks of data collection, while being safely deferred for patients with a later predicted high-risk period.
Novel sources of timely data on population- and individuallevel asthma activities are needed to provide additional temporal
and geographical granularity to asthma risk stratification. Short
of collecting information directly from individual patients (a
time- and resource-intensive endeavor), readily available public data will have to be repurposed intelligently to provide the
required information.
There has been increasing interest in gathering nontraditional,
digital information to perform disease surveillance. These include diverse datasets such as those stemming from social media, internet search, and environmental data. Twitter is an online
social media platform that enables users to post and read 140character messages called “tweets.” It is a popular data source
for disease surveillance using social media since it can provide
nearly instant access to real-time social opinions. More importantly, tweets are often tagged by geographic location and time
stamps potentially providing information for disease surveillance [8], [9]. Another notable nontraditional disease surveillance system has been a data-aggregating tool called Google
Flu Trends, which uses aggregated search data to estimate flu
activity [10], [11]. Google Trends was quite successful in its estimation of influenza-like illness. It is based on Google’s search

engine, which tracks how often a particular search-term is entered relative to the total search-volume across a particular area.
This enables access to the latest data from web search interest
trends on a variety of topics, including diseases like asthma.
Air pollutants are known triggers for asthma symptoms and exacerbations [12]. The United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) provides access to monitored air quality data collected at outdoor sensors across the country, which could be used
as a data source for asthma prediction. Meanwhile, as health reform progresses, the quantity and variety of health records being
made available electronically are increasing dramatically [13].
In contrast to the traditional disease surveillance systems, these
new data sources have the potential to enable health organizations to respond to chronic conditions, like asthma, in real time.
This in turn implies that health organizations can appropriately
plan for staffing and equipment availability in a flexible manner. They can also provide early warning signals to the people
at risk for asthma adverse events, and enable timely, proactive,
and targeted preventive and therapeutic interventions.
Our research objective is to leverage social media, internet
search, and environmental air quality data to estimate ED visits
for asthma in a relatively discrete geographic area (a metropolitan area) within a relatively short time period (days). To this end,
we have gathered asthma-related ED visits data, social media
data from Twitter, internet users’ search interests from Google
and pollution sensor data from the EPA, all from the same geographic area and time period, to create a model for predicting
asthma-related ED visits. This study is different from extant
studies that typically predict the spread of contagious diseases
using social media such as Twitter. Unlike influenza or other
viral diseases, asthma is a noncommunicable health condition
and we demonstrate the utility and value of linking big data
from diverse sources in developing predictive models for noncommunicable diseases with a specific focus on asthma.
II. BACKGROUND
A number of research studies have explored the use of
novel data sources to propose rapid, cost-effective health status surveillance methodologies. Some of the early studies rely
on document classification suggesting that Twitter data can be
highly relevant for early detection of public health threats [14].
Others employ more complex linguistic analysis, such as the
Ailment Topic Aspect Model [15], which is useful for syndrome
surveillance. This type of analysis is useful for demonstrating
the significance of social media as a promising new data source
for health surveillance.
Other recent studies have linked social media data with realworld disease incidence to generate actionable knowledge useful
for making health care decisions. These include [16], which
analyzed Twitter messages related to influenza and correlated
them with reported CDC statistics. Similarly, a study by Chew
[17] during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, validated Twitter as a
real-time content, sentiment, and public attention trend-tracking
tool. Collier [18] employed supervised classifiers (SVM and
Naive Bayes) to classify tweets into four self-reported protective
behavior categories. This study adds to evidence supporting a

1217

high degree of correlation between prediagnostic social media
signals and diagnostic influenza case data.
While, these disease surveillance systems, including Google
Flu trends [10], based on novel data sources have shown significant promise, other studies have challenged the accuracy of these
systems for two reasons [19], [25]. 1) Anomalous media spikes:
People searching flu terms may have had symptoms—but many
users might have been simply looking for news stories about
an anomalous season. Media attention might increase tweets
about specific diseases but may not necessarily reflect actual
disease affliction. 2) Misleading information: Tweets indicating
awareness of disease, e.g., “Hope I don’t get asthma,” or using
disease as rhetoric, e.g., “He is so cute I think I got asthma,” are
clearly about a specific disease but are not about actual disease
affliction. These kinds of signals can be misleading and can
mask signs of actual disease affliction. These issues and challenges are being addressed by several studies including [19] and
[20]. For instance, Google Flu Trends engineers announced a
redesign of their algorithm by dampening media attention and
using Elastic Net, rather than regression, for estimation [19].
Commonly used Twitter techniques such as keyword matching
or linear regression can widely overestimate the prevalence of
disease. Broniatowski and Paul [8] have specifically addressed
this issue and built models to determine if tweets were relevant to health, influenza, or an actual infection. In addition,
they used geographic information associated with tweets for
influenza surveillance.
Building on these techniques, our work uses a combination
of data from multiple sources to predict the number of asthmarelated ED visits in near real time. In doing so, we exploit
geographic information associated with each dataset. We describe the techniques to process multiple types of datasets, to
extract signals from each, integrate, and feed into a prediction
model using machine learning algorithms, and demonstrate the
feasibility of such a prediction.
III. METHODS
We have examined the feasibility of using multiple data
sources for predicting the number of asthma-related ED visits. A
preliminary prediction model was built for this purpose. Semisupervised classification models were applied on data streams
stemming from Twitter to distinguish tweets indicating asthma
affliction from tweets just including keywords related to asthma.
We also processed air quality data obtained from sensors, historical electronic health records indicating asthma-related visits
to an emergency room, and Google search trends, all from the
same specific geographic area, during the same time period.
A. Data Collection and Processing
1) ED Data: Deidentified aggregate data on ED visits for
asthma as a primary diagnosis (International Classification of
Disease Ninth [ICD9] code 493.00 to 493.99) to the Children’s Medical Center (CMC) of Dallas were collected between
October 2013 and December 2013 for a Quality Improvement
initiative (see Fig. 1). Additional data were collected between
November and December 2013 on ED visits for constipation

(ICD9 564.00 to 564.09) or abdominal pain (ICD9 789.00 to
789.09) to serve as controls for background variations in the
number ED visits unrelated to asthma activity. The two control
conditions were chosen because they affect a different organ system than asthma and are unlikely to be related to asthma. The
study was approved by the CMC Institutional Review Board.
It should be noted that the average and standard deviation
of the ED visits data from December (ave = 81, std = 40) are
significantly different from the first two months’ data (ave = 94,
std = 25). So we excluded December’s ED visits data from one
of our correlation analyses.
2) Twitter Data: Twitter offers streaming APIs to give developers and researchers low latency access to its global stream
of data. Public streams, which can provide access to the public
data flowing through Twitter, were used in this study. Studies
have estimated that using Twitter’s Streaming API, researchers
can expect to receive 1% of the tweets in near real time. Twitter4j, an unofficial Java library for the Twitter API, was used to
access tweet information from the Twitter Streaming API. Two
different Twitter datasets were collected in this study. 1) The
general twitter stream: A simple collection of JSON grabbed
from the general Twitter stream. The general tweet counts were
used to estimate the Twitter population and further normalize
asthma tweet counts. 2) The asthma-related stream: to collect
only tweets containing any of 19 related keywords that were
suggested by our clinical collaborators from PCCI. The asthma
stream is limited to 1% of full tweets as well.
Fig. 2 shows the number of tweets in our asthma stream
for some of the keywords used in data collection. Our Twitter
dataset for this study was collected from October 11, 2013,
through December 31, 2013, and contains 464 845 785 general

Fig. 3. (a) Global Asthma related tweets (Asthma stream, October 11, 2013–

tweets and 1 315 390 asthma-related tweets. On average, 15 000
asthma-related tweets were generated from all over the world per
day. This demonstrates that Twitter is a promising data source
for asthma surveillance and should be explored further.
The geographic location of each tweet is identified via two
fields: coordinates and location. Coordinates indicate the longitude and latitude of the tweet’s location, e.g., {“coordinates”:
[−97.51087576, 35.46500176]}. Unfortunately, only a small
percentage of tweets expose their coordinates. Among all the
asthma-related tweets we collected, only 2% (35152/1315390)
of the tweets revealed their coordinates as shown in Fig. 3(a).
Most of these tweets are from English-speaking countries and
approximately 60% of them are from the United States [see
Fig. 3(b)]. We further analyzed these tweets based on a subset
of our keywords [see Fig. 4(a) and (b)].
Locations indicate the cities and states where the users, who
posted tweets, reside, e.g., {“location”: “San Francisco, CA,
USA”}. This information was collected from Twitter users’
public biographic profiles. To estimate the prevalence of asthmarelated tweets in a geographic region, we only included tweets
from that particular region. We confined our analysis to the Twitter streaming data collected from the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW)
Metropolitan area in Texas, to closely match the geographical
origins of patients in our clinical data sample. The boundary of
the region and geographical “coordinates” are shown in Fig. 5.
As previously mentioned, not many people divulge their
location in their tweets; consequently, in our dataset, only

892 asthma-related tweets were actually identified to fall within
the geographic boundaries of interest to our study. Hence, we
examined the dataset in more detail, and collected profiles of
users tweeting about asthma. By examining these user profiles,
we were able to extract users’ locations from their profile information and identified additional tweets stemming from our location of interest. We were, thus, able to identify 3 768 additional
tweets from the asthma stream in the area of interest, and a total
of 1 953 402 tweets from the general stream in the same area.
One of the challenges we needed to address was to extract
signal from the noisy Twitter dataset, i.e., to distinguish tweets
that are relevant to asthma from tweets that mentioned asthma
in an irrelevant context. Fig. 6 shows the process used for cleaning the Twitter dataset. First, non-English tweets and retweets
were excluded. The exclusion of non-English tweets is not expected to have a major impact on the analysis as 95% of tweets
originating in the USA, including our geographical region of interest, are in English [21]. We transformed tweets to lower case,
e.g., removing all the special characters, targets (@), hashtags
(#), URLs, and emoticons. Each tweet was then tokenized by
splitting based on nonletter characters. The tokens were used to
generate a vector numerically representing each tweet. TF-IDF
(term frequency–inverse document frequency) [22] was used for

Extracting signal from noisy twitter dataset.

this purpose. All the words were stemmed by applying Porter’s
algorithm [23] and English stop-words [24] were filtered out.
We then employed a machine learning classification technique called artificial neural networks (ANN) to accurately identify relevant tweets, using the process shown in Fig. 6. ANN is a
supervised classification technique requiring a training dataset.
First, we extracted a dataset containing 4 500 tweets from our
asthma stream described earlier, i.e., each tweet in the training dataset contained at least one asthma-related keyword. This
dataset was divided into three parts and each tweet was manually
labeled by three researchers as “asthma relevant” or “asthma irrelevant.” The annotation criteria for “asthma relevant” tweets
included: a statement that the individual has had asthma; and
supporting criteria included: 1) severe difficulty in breathing
as part of a discrete attack, (2) shortness of breath-triggered
by exercise, stress, smoke, or irritants, 3) night time coughing
duration greater than 1 month, 4) family history or childhood
history of asthma, or 5) use of an inhaler.
The classifier was trained on this dataset. A tenfold cross
validation was executed to evaluate the performance. The
results showed a high overall accuracy of 85.78%. The

precision for “asthma irrelevant” class was 86.71% and the precision for “asthma relevant” class was 66.67%. The recall for
“true asthma irrelevant” class was as high as 98.15%, whereas
the recall for “true asthma relevant” class was 19.72%, indicating that there is a lot of noise in the data. Despite the latter low
recall, the large Twitter dataset provided a sufficient number of:
“true” asthma-related tweets for the analyses.
This complex cleaning process resulted in a dataset from
which we were able to extract a sufficient number of asthmarelated tweets in the geographic area of interest along with their
specific timestamps.
3) Google Data: Google Trends analyzes its search engine
traffic to determine the usage frequency of specific search-terms
by individual users as compared to the total number of Google
searches performed during a specific time period. To make it
easier to compare data on different keywords, results in Google
Trends are normalized using their total search traffic. Using the
keywords from our Twitter asthma stream collection process,
we extracted data from Google Trends. To align with the ED
visits data, Google search interests were accessed for the same
time period and in the same location as the Twitter data (see
Fig. 7).
We retrieved Google search interest data by accessing the
Google Trends website (www.google.com/trends) on three specific dates, December 10, 2013, February 21, 2014, and September 20, 2014 with the same query. For reasons unknown to us,
the results are different on each of the three days. We used each
of the three datasets for our analysis as described later.
4) Sensor Data: Air pollution data were collected from the
EPA databases (www.epa.gov). The dataset contains measures
of six types of pollutants, i.e., particulate matter, ground-level
ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and
lead. The air quality indexes (AQI) associated with these pollutants were used in our model. The higher the AQI value, the
greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. Along with the AQI, we were able to get the AQS-SITE-ID
(Air Quality System, site identification) from the EPA database.
A Site ID is associated with a specific physical location and
address. The site latitude and longitude also are provided. Using this information, we collected AQI data from 27 sites in
the DFW area. The sites closest to the zip codes of origin of
asthma patients were retained for analysis. Using this data, we
calculated daily average AQI for our prediction model.
B. Prediction Model
We first analyzed the association between the asthma-related
ED visits and data from Twitter, Google trends, and Air Quality
sensors, using the Pearson correlation coefficient. We also ex-

amined the association between asthma-related tweet counts and
ED visit counts for abdominal pain/constipation patients, to control for nonasthma-specific variations in ED visit counts. Then,
we designed and implemented a prediction model to estimate
the incidence of asthma ED visits at CMC using a combination
of independent variables from the aforementioned data sources.
Since each dataset is from a different source and has different
levels of granularity with respect to time and location, we first
performed some transformations on each dataset to make them
compatible. An important transformation was to normalize each
dataset using a standard normalization technique, i.e., z-score
z=

x−u
σ

(1)

where u is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.
Additionally, Twitter data were normalized by calculating the
ratio of asthma-related tweets to the total number of tweets in
the general twitter stream collected from the same geo-region
in a given time.
For the prediction model, we employed four different classification methods: Decision tree, Naive Bayes, SVM, and ANN,
and compared their classification accuracy. We also used techniques called adaptive boosting and stacking, to reduce classification errors. The ED visit counts were converted from numerical to categorical values based on the z-values, where the
observations were labeled as “High,” “Medium,” or “Low.” Our
model was used to classify the predicted variable, i.e., number of
daily ED visits, into one of three complementary and mutually
exclusive classes—High, Medium, or Low. The Naive Bayes
technique requires nominal data, hence, another transformation
was used to convert all numerical data values into categorical
values based on the z values similar to the transformation used
for ED visit counts.
IV. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
A. Relationship Between ED Visits and Individual Types of
Data
We first report on the relationship between asthma ED visits
and each individual type of dataset, i.e., Twitter, Google trends,
and Air Quality sensors.
Of note, Twitter data were only available beginning on
October 11, 2013, and ED visits data were not available after
December 24, 2013. We, therefore, performed the correlation
analysis based on 74 days’ worth of data. Our results indicate that absolute asthma tweets count is correlated with the
asthma ED visit counts (r = 0.328, p < 0.01) (see Table I). After normalization of the number asthma tweets using the daily
number of general tweets, the correlation coefficient improved
(r = 0.378, p < 0.01) (see Table I).
Given that the average and standard deviation of the asthma
ED visits data for December 2013 (ave = 81, std = 40) are
significantly different from the first two months’ data (ave =
94, std = 25), we did a sensitivity analysis excluding data from
December, which left us 50 observations. The 50 observations
showed further improvement of correlation between the number
of asthma tweets and asthma ED visit counts (see Table II).

Meanwhile, as a control, we also examined the relationship
between asthma tweets count and abdominal pain/constipation
ED visit counts. The absence of correlation speaks to the specificity of the association between asthma-related tweets and
asthma ED visits (see Table III).
We next report on the correlation between the pollutant indexes and asthma ED visits (pollutant data after December 24,
2013 were removed since there was no ED visits data available after that date). Three pollutant indexes, i.e., CO, NO2 , and
PM2.5 show significant correlation with asthma ED visits (see
Table IV and Fig. 8).
As stated earlier, we had three different datasets collected
from Google trends. We examined the relationship between each

dataset and asthma ED visits (Table V). The asthma ED visits
were only correlated with one of the Google datasets, hence,
Google data were not included in the final prediction model.
B. Prediction Results
Based on the results from the correlation analysis, asthma
tweets, CO, NO2 , and PM2.5 were selected as inputs into our
prediction model. We are only reporting results for the Decision Tree and ANN techniques, as the Naive Bayes and SVM
techniques did not yield good prediction results.
First, backward feature selection algorithm was used to examine if the addition of Twitter data would improve the prediction.
As shown in Table VI, combining air quality data with tweets
resulted in higher prediction accuracy.
Additionally, we evaluated prediction precision. Given that
our prediction task is for a three-way classification, each technique resulted in different prediction and/or precision in different classes (see Table VII). Decision Tree performed well in predicting the “High” class, while ANN, after Adaptive Boosting,
worked well for the “Low” class. Stacking the two techniques
performed well for the “Medium” class.
The results of our analysis are promising because they
perform with a fairly high level of accuracy overall. As noted
in the introduction, traditional asthma ED visit models are
useful for predicting events in a three-month window and
have an accuracy of approximately 70%. It is to be noted that
“traditional models” estimate a risk score for asthma ED visit

for each individual patient, whereas our “Twitter/Environmental
data model” predicts the risk for a daily number of ED visits
being High, Low, or Medium. The former is an individual-level
risk model, while the latter is a population-level risk model. Our
population-level asthma risk prediction model has the potential
for complementing current individual-level models, and may
lead to a shorter time window and better accuracy of prediction.
This in turn has implications for better planning and proactive
treatment in specific geo-locations at specific time periods.
V. DISCUSSION, IMPLICATIONS, AND LIMITATIONS
Although preliminary, the findings of this study are very
promising for many reasons. As asthma prevalence continues
to rise, novel and coordinated strategies are required at the
public health and clinical levels to curb the societal burden of
asthma adverse outcomes. Readily available, real-time or nearreal-time, environmental and internet-based data offer a unique
opportunity for early identification of clusters of patients or communities at high risk for severe asthma events at a given time.
Interventions would be prioritized in time and place to reduce the
risk for asthma ED visits. For instance, public health resources
could be used to reach out to patients from high-risk clusters
or communities at any given time, and direct them toward less
costly and more efficient care sites such as their primary care
provider offices. Moreover, predicted risks could be spatially
and temporally visualized, and made available to community
stakeholders through various media sources. Clinical resources
could be prioritized to offer earlier clinic appointments to patients with impending risk for failure, and later, slots to patients
with deferred risk. Additionally, hospitals and EDs could use
such risk stratification for optimal resource planning, such as
ED staffing or opening observation units.
The limitations of our study include: First, this study is limited to English tweets, which might not accurately represent the
Twitter activity of non-English speakers, although, the latter are
likely represented in our ED sample. However, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on the final results given
that non-English tweets represent less than 5% of tweets in the
USA, as discussed in the “Methods” section. Second, this study
was limited to ED visits data from one hospital only which did
not allow us to examine variations around different clinical care
sites. A larger study is underway to validate these preliminary
findings in a larger clinical sample spanning a wider geographical area over a longer timeframe. Third, the current model is
designed for a noncommunicable disease (asthma) with a significant prevalence in the community. Although similar models
could be developed for other noncommunicable diseases such

as diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
this model might not be suitable for communicable diseases or
for diseases with low prevalence and high social media activity
reflecting public awareness rather than actual disease activity.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH
In this study, we have provided preliminary evidence that social media and environmental data can be leveraged to accurately
predict asthma ED visits at a population level.
We are in the process of confirming these preliminary findings
by collecting larger clinical datasets across different seasons and
multiple hospitals. Our continued work is focused on extending this research to propose a temporal prediction model that
analyzes the trends in tweets and AQI changes, and estimates
the time lag between these changes and the number of asthma
ED visits. We also are collecting AQI data over a longer time
period to examine the effects of seasonal variations. In addition,
we would like to explore the effect of relevant data from other
types of social media interactions, e.g., blogs and discussion forums, on our asthma visit prediction model. Additional studies
are needed to examine how combining real-time or near-realtime social media and environmental data with more traditional
data might affect the performance and timing of the current
individual-level prediction models for asthma, and eventually,
for other chronic conditions. In future projects, we intend to
extend our work to diseases with geographical and temporal
variability, e.g., COPD and diabetes.
