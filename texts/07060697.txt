Optimal Drug Prediction From Personal
Genomics Profiles
Jianting Sheng, Fuhai Li, and Stephen T. C. Wong

Abstract—Cancer patients often show heterogeneous drug responses such that only a small subset of patients is sensitive to a
given anticancer drug. With the availability of large-scale genomic
profiling via next-generation sequencing, it is now economically
feasible to profile the whole transcriptome and genome of individual patients in order to identify their unique genetic mutations and
differentially expressed genes, which are believed to be responsible
for heterogeneous drug responses. Although subtyping analysis has
identified patient subgroups sharing common biomarkers, there is
no effective method to predict the drug response of individual patients precisely and reliably. Herein, we propose a novel computational algorithm to predict the drug response of individual patients
based on personal genomic profiles, as well as pharmacogenomic
and drug sensitivity data. Specifically, more than 600 cancer cell
lines (viewed as individual patients) across over 50 types of cancers
and their responses to 75 drugs were obtained from the genomics
of drug sensitivity in cancer database. The drug-specific sensitivity
signatures were determined from the changes in genomic profiles
of individual cell lines in response to a specific drug. The optimal
drugs for individual cell lines were predicted by integrating the
votes from other cell lines. The experimental results show that the
proposed drug prediction algorithm can be used to improve greatly
the reliability of finding optimal drugs for individual patients and
will, thus, form a key component in the precision medicine infrastructure for oncology care.

cers from the same organ are often quite distinct, as evidenced
by the observation that cancer patients with the same cancer
type often show heterogeneous responses to the same therapy.
It is believed that complex and distinct genomic instability is
responsible for the diversity in drug response [1], [2]. For example, one nonsmall cell lung cancer patient was found to be
responsive to Dasatinib dramatically and remained cancer-free
for four years later [3]. In the consequent genomic analysis, an
inactivating BRAF mutation (Y472C) was found in the patient’s
tumor, while no inactivating BRAF mutations were found in the
nonresponding tumors [3]. The Pan-Cancer project [4], which
aims to analyze the molecular aberrations in cancer cells across
a range of tumor types, combines all of the data from different
tumor types and enables researchers and scientists to find new
patterns of genomic aberrations.
To support studies on uncovering the relationship between the
genomic aberrations and diverse drug responses, many valuable large-scale genomic datasets funded by federal agencies
have been generated for public access. For example, Cancer
Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) [5] and Genomics of Drug
Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) [6] are two projects that generate
such databases and aim to systemically study the causal correlations between drug sensitivity and genomic biomarkers in
hundreds of cancer cell lines. Moreover, the connectivity map
generated gene expression signature data of different cell lines
under various perturbations by more than 1000 small molecules
[7]. These data have been scaled since over 1000 times and is
publicly available at the library of integrated-network-based cellular signatures (http://www.lincscloud.org/). These large-scale
datasets have been used to enable drug repositioning [8], [9],
predict drug combinations [10], [11], and delineate mechanisms
of action [12], and are becoming an important component in drug
discovery [13], [14]. Meanwhile, gene expression omnibus [15],
a public database repository, also archives millions of microarray datasets of various types of cancer under different treatments
and perturbations.
Many approaches have been developed to reposition or repurpose known drugs to new indications [16], [17], based on the
assumption that drugs sharing similar chemical structures would
have same targets. With the advance of large-scale genomic profiling techniques, it is economically feasible to profile the whole
transcriptome and genome (e.g., microarray, RNAseq, DNAseq,
and somatic copy number alterations) [18]–[20] of individual
patients and identify their unique genetic mutations and differentially expressed genes, which in turn can be used as biomarkers to predict drug sensitivity for those patients. For example, the
cancer genome atlas [21], [22] database repository has collected
comprehensive genomics profiles of over 10 000 patient samples

covering more than 30 types of cancer. Also, the International
Cancer Genome Consortium [23] was formed to coordinate the
generation and management of large-scale genomic datasets
from over 50 cancer types or subtypes collected from all over
the world. These large-scale and comprehensive genomic profiling datasets are invaluable in identifying predictive biomarkers
of an individual’s drug response, these unique biomarkers can
be used for personalized medicine [15], [24]–[26].
Though subtyping analysis of cancer patients has identified
patient subgroups sharing common biomarkers, the genomic instability patterns among the subtypes of a cancer are complex
and not easily distinguishable [18], [22], [27]–[29]. Thus, these
genomic patterns derived from the subtyping analysis often fail
to offer insight into drug sensitivity and identify reliable predictive biomarkers of individual subtypes. Herein, we propose a
novel computational algorithm to predict the optimal drugs for
individual patients based on personal genomic profiles, as well
as available pharmacogenomics and drug sensitivity information
across cancer types. Specifically, 624 cancer cell lines (viewed
as individual patients) and their responses to 75 drugs were
obtained from GDSC. The drug-specific sensitivity signatures
were obtained with the genomics profile changes of individual
cell lines. Then, the optimal drug treatments for individual cell
lines were predicted by integrating the drug response information from the other cell lines. To test the accuracy of our drug
prediction algorithm, we performed twofold cross validation on
GDSC dataset and further downloaded 480 cell lines and their
responses to 11 drugs from CCLE for validation. The results
show that our prediction algorithm can significantly improve
the chance of finding sensitive drugs for individual patients.

II. DATA AND METHODOLOGY
A. Data
The simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES)
data that describe the structure of compounds using short ASCII
strings were downloaded from PubChem (version 2.0.1, 17
October, 2011) [30]. Gene expression data of cell lines and
the IC50 data of drugs on the cell lines were downloaded from
GDSC (release 4, March 2013) and CCLE (version 2.17, August
2014). Only drugs that have both SMILES and IC50 information, and cell lines that have both IC50 and gene expression
profile data were used in our analysis. In summary, IC50 data
of 75 drugs on 624 cell lines in GDSC and 24 drugs on 504 cell
lines in CCLE were obtained.
B. Algorithm Overview
Fig. 1 shows an overview of the proposed drug prediction algorithm. Let D be the set of known drugs in GDSC, C be the cell
line set, and G be the drug-related gene signature consisting of
differentially expressed genes between the drug-specific resistant and sensitive cell lines, where nd = |D| , nc = |C| , ng =
|G| denoting the number of drugs, cell lines, and genes, respectively. Let A = (aij ) be the cell line expression matrix, where
aij is the expression value of gene gi ∈ G in cell line cj ∈ C.
Let B = (bj k ) be the IC50 value matrix, where bj k is the normalized IC50 value of cell line cj ∈ C treated by drug dk ∈ D.
For each drug-cell line pair, we first calculate similarity scores
for pairwise drugs based on their chemical structures and then
select most similar drugs to the given one. A gene signature is

1266

IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS, VOL. 19, NO. 4, JULY 2015

calculated based on the IC50 values of the selected drugs and
gene expression profiles of the cell lines. A flexible similarity
score between cell lines was calculated based on the gene signature, and finally, we assign a drug-cell line effect score by
combining drug-similarity scores and cell line similarity scores.
Using this method, we predicted the top candidate drugs that
have the best sensitivity for the given cell line.
C. IC50 Value Normalization
As suggested by GDSC, cell lines with IC50 values greater
than the maximum concentration of a drug are likely to be
resistant to that drug, while those with IC50 values smaller than
maximum concentration are likely to be sensitive. So we divide
the raw IC50 value by the maximum concentration of dk ∈ D
and then log2-transform it as normalized IC50 value. For drugcell line pairs that lack IC50 values from GDSC, we set their
normalized IC50 to 0. Cell lines with a normalized IC50 value
greater than 0 are considered to be resistant cell lines to the
drug, while others with normalized IC50 value smaller than 0
were considered to be sensitive. As the range of IC50 values of
sensitive cell lines differs from the range of resistant cells, we
further scaled the normalized IC50 value to the range of [−1,1]
for the following analysis.
D. Drug–Drug Similarity
Given two drugs dk 1 ∈ D and dk 2 ∈ D, the “rcdk” R package
[31] is used to retrieve their fingerprint information f pk 1 and
f pk 2 from the SMILES data. The similarity between the two
drugs,S (dk 1 , dk 2 ) , is calculated using Tanimoto coefficient
c
S (dk 1 , dk 2 ) =
a+b+c
where c is the number of fingerprints that appear in both f pk 1
(fingerprints of dk 1 by using the “fingerprint” R package) and
f pk 2 (fingerprints of dk 2 ), a is the number of fingerprints that
only appear in f pk 1 , and b is the number of fingerprints that
only appear in f pk 2 .
E. Patient–Patient Genomics Similarity
Even if two cell lines (or patient cells) share similar overall
gene expression signatures, they might still have different drugtreatment response due to the variability in gene expressions
of the drug-resistance-related genes. Here, we propose a new
method of calculating the cell line similarity scores based on
drug-specific-related genes, i.e., different similarity scores are
given to each pair of cell lines for different drugs as follows.
For a given drug dgiven ∈ D, to calculate cell line similarity, we first calculate the drug–drug similarities, Sk =
S(dgiven , dk ), between dgiven and all other drugs dk ∈ D. Then,
we rank dk in descending order Sk . Top rd drugs, which show
the most similarity to the given drug, are selected as Dd g i v e n .
The next step is to find a gene signature for Dd g i v e n and calculate
cell line similarity score based on this signature.
For each drug dt ∈ Dd g i v e n , we separate cell lines into two
groups according to their normalized IC50 values. If bj t ,
which is the IC50 value of cell lines cj treated by drug dt ,

is greater than 0, cj is assigned to group 1 (the resistant
group); whereas, the others with bj t < 0 are assigned to group
2 (the sensitive group). For each gene gi , we calculate its fold
change between the mean expression levels of the two groups,
m ean{a |b > 0, j =1,...,n }
Fold(gi ) = m ean{a ii jj |b jj tt < 0, j =1,...,n cc } . The top 1 % genes with
the largest or smallest fold change are selected as the gene signature of dt , denoted by Gd t . Then, signatures of all drugs in
Dd g i v e n are combined together as the signature of Dd g i v e n , denoted by G(dgiven ) = ∪ ∈ Gd t .
d t ∈D d g i v e n

Using the k signature genes in G(dgiven ) as the features,
we define the similarity values S (cj 1 , cj 2 ) between two cell
lines cj 1 , cj 2 ∈ C under drug dgiven as the Pearson correlation coefficient between < ai1j 1 , ai2j 1 , . . . , aik j 1 >(aij 1 ) and
< ai1j 2 , ai2j 2 , . . . , aik j 2 > aij 2 , where gi ∈ G(dgiven ). To be
consistent to the drug–drug similarity score, we scale S (cj 1 , cj 2 )
to [0, 1]. Given a cell line cgiven , the top rc cell lines that are
most similar to it are selected as Cc g i v e n .
F. Drug-Patient Similarity
Given the gene expression profile of a patient, we rank the
effects of all drugs in GDSC on this patient by defining the
drug-patient effect score S(dgiven , cgiven ). We first find Dd g i v e n
to include top rd drugs that are most similar to dgiven and Cc g i v e n
to include top rc cell lines that are most similar to cgiven . Then,
the drug-patient effect score is defined by

III. RESULTS
The raw IC50 values for 75 drugs on 624 cell lines from
GDSC and their cell line expression profiles were collected,
and normalized as described in Section II. Fig. 2 shows the
heatmap of the normalized IC50 values (column scaled). The
normalized IC50 values were further scaled to [−1, 1] (−1
means the most sensitive, and 1 means the most resistant) for
the subsequent analysis. We selected the top 1% genes (about
300 genes) with the largest or smallest fold change between
the resistant group and sensitive group as the gene expression
signature of individual drugs. Fig. 3 shows the distinct gene
expression signatures of AICAR and Dasatinib. To predict the
effectiveness between a given cell line and a given drug, the top
rd most similar drugs and rc cell lines were tested. Finally, we
assigned a similarity score for each drug-cell line (patient) pair.
Given a new cell line, the top ranked drugs were considered to
be the best candidates.
We have conducted two new validation strategies to reduce
the bias in validation and for selecting optimal values for rd and
rc . The first one is to use twofold cross validation for modeling
GDSC dataset, and the second one is to use GDSC dataset as
the training set and CCLE dataset as the independent testing set.

Heatmap for normalized IC50 values of 75 drugs (columns) on 624 cell lines (rows). Green means the most sensitive, red means the most resistant.

First, we apply twofold cross validation on GDSC dataset, i.e.,
randomly divide the cell lines into two subgroups, with equal
size and each time use one as training set and the other as testing
set. The testing results are then averaged for each rd and rc . The
drug responses on the testing set were estimated using drug
treated IC50 values on the training set. Top ten prioritized drugs
for each testing cell line were selected. All the drugs were ranked
in increasing order based on their normalized IC50 values on the
given cell line. We then calculated the enrichment score of the
ten drugs in the ordered drug list using the gene set enrichment
analysis (GSEA) [32], denoted as EScl . The enrichment score,
EScl , which ranges from −1 to 1, and would be close to 1 if the
selected drugs were found at the top of the ranked drug list and
vice versa. To test whether our selected drugs for the given cell
line ranked higher than random selection, we randomly selected
ten drugs for each cell line for 5000 times and recalculated
the enrichment score, denoted by ESi , i = 1, . . . , 5000. The p

value was calculated as

i= 1

, where fi =

.

Small p value (here we set the threshold as p < 0.05) means that
the prediction can discover the more sensitive drugs to the given
cell line, compared with the random selection. The percentage of
cell lines with corresponding p value <0.05 were then averaged
(twofold cross validation) to for each rd = [1, . . . , 4] and rc =
[1, . . . , 10]. The results were shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen,
the prediction power of single drug (rd = 1) decreases when
more similar cell lines being added (noise sensitive), whereas,
the prediction power with multiple similar drugs increases with
more similar cell lines (noise robust). Especially, the parameter
setting rd = 3 and rc = 9 generates the best prediction power.
Moreover, the CCLE datasets were also collected for the validation. There are 11 drugs in both GDSC and CCLE database.
We use GDSC data as the training set, and download drug
treated IC50 values for 480 cell lines of the 11 drugs from

CCLE database as the testing dataset. We then predict the drug
responses on 480 cell lines in CCLE for 11 drugs. Since there
are only 11 drugs available, it is hard to find sensitive drugs for
each cell line. We, thus, select top 10 drug-cell line pairs predicted using our model and compare their IC50 values in CCLE
with all other drug-cell line IC50 values. Then, p values were
calculated for each rd and rc using GSEA as described above.
The results were shown in Table I. As we can see, the p values
are smaller than 0.05 in almost all the cases, which means the
top 10 drug-cell line pairs predicted by our model have a much
lower IC50 value compared with random selection, and thus, the
cell lines are more sensitive to these drugs. Note that the p value

for rd = 3 and rc = 9 was smaller than 4e–4. By considering
both validation methods, we suggest to use rd = 3 and rc = 9
in our model.
In summary, the proposed prediction algorithm can improve
the effective drug selection significantly, and the evaluation
results indicate the possibility of selecting the optimal drugs
among all anticancer drugs based on their genomic profiles to
achieve better therapeutic outcomes.
IV. DISCUSSION
It is difficult to determine “sensitive” responses to drugs. We
use normalized IC50 score to measure the cell line sensitivity

SHENG et al.: OPTIMAL DRUG PREDICTION FROM PERSONAL GENOMICS PROFILES

based on the documents of GDSC, which suggest that cell lines
with acute drug response, IC50 < max drug concentration, and
small confidence intervals are supposed to be sensitive to drugs.
In the latest release of GDSC (release 5, June 2014), a Z-score is
calculated for each cell line to define “sensitive” and “resistance”
to drugs. Both measurements should be fine and people can also
use other drug response data to replace the normalized IC50
values in our algorithm.
There also exist other algorithms to find differentially expressed genes between sensitive groups and resistant groups.
We first tested if t-test could be used to find drug signatures. We
did Shapiro–Wilk test on the expression values of genes across
cell lines and found that the expression value of most of the genes
(over 10 000) did not form normal distribution. Thus, t-test and
other similar methods such as SAMR were not suitable here.
Then, we tested Wilcoxon rank sum test which was a nonparametric statistic test followed by the Benjamini and Hochberg
method (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, 57,
289–300, 1995) to control false discovery rate. Genes with adjusted p value <0.05 were selected as drug signature. However,
the number of differentially expressed genes varies significantly
from tens to thousands; furthermore, the drug prediction result
is worse than using the top 1% fold change genes. One possible
reason is that the sample size of sensitive cell lines for each drug
is usually too small (less than 10) to provide sufficient power
for statistic testing.
V. CONCLUSION
Patients with the same type of cancer often respond differently to the same drug treatment, and only a small subset of patients has profound sensitivity to the given drugs. The complex
and distinct genomic instability of individual cancer patients is
believed to be responsible for that diversity in drug response.
Due to recent advances made in the next-generation sequencing,
large-scale pharmacogenomic databases are now publicly available, while genomic profiling of individual patients is becoming
economically affordable. It is timely to leverage such information to predict the drug sensitivity for each patient in order to
achieve the optimal personalized treatment. However, computational analysis is the bottleneck in associating the complex
genomic profiles reliably with heterogeneous drug responses.
Motivated by the public availability of informative data resources, this study contributed a computational algorithm for
predicting the best drugs for individual cell lines (representing
individual patients) based on their genomic profiles and drug
response data. Our cross validation showed that the best drug
prediction results on over 40% cell lines are improved significantly compared to random selection. Moreover, the results
from CCLE validation showed that the top ten most sensitive drug-cell line pairs predicted by our model using GDSC
database have significant lower IC50 values than others. Our research finding suggests the potential of selecting optimal drugs
among anticancer drugs for individual patients based on their
genomic profiles, which will impact the cancer clinical regimen
profoundly. Our ongoing work of integrating the drug prediction algorithm into the precision medicine framework being

developed at Houston Methodist Cancer Center to investigate
personal genomic profiles from patients, evaluate the prediction results on patient-derived xenograft models, and track the
predictive performance on selected patients under treatment at
