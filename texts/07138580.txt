Classification of Parkinson’s Disease Gait Using
Spatial-Temporal Gait Features
Ferdous Wahid, Rezaul K. Begg, Chris J. Hass, Saman Halgamuge, and David C. Ackland

Abstract— Quantitative gait assessment is important in diagnosis and management of Parkinson’s disease (PD); however, gait
characteristics of a cohort are dispersed by patient physical properties including age, height, body mass, and gender, as well as walking
speed, which may limit capacity to discern some pathological features. The aim of this study was twofold. First, to use a multiple
regression normalization strategy that accounts for subject age,
height, body mass, gender, and self-selected walking speed to identify differences in spatial-temporal gait features between PD patients and controls; and second, to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning strategies in classifying PD gait after gait normalization. Spatial-temporal gait data during self-selected walking were
obtained from 23 PD patients and 26 aged-matched controls. Data
were normalized using standard dimensionless equations and multiple regression normalization. Machine learning strategies were
then employed to classify PD gait using the raw gait data, data
normalized using dimensionless equations, and data normalized
using the multiple regression approach. After normalizing data
using the dimensionless equations, only stride length, step length,
and double support time were significantly different between PD
patients and controls (p < 0.05); however, normalizing data using the multiple regression method revealed significant differences
in stride length, cadence, stance time, and double support time.
Random Forest resulted in a PD classification accuracy of 92.6%
after normalizing gait data using the multiple regression approach,
compared to 80.4% (support vector machine) and 86.2% (kernel
Fisher discriminant) using raw data and data normalized using dimensionless equations, respectively. Our multiple regression normalization approach will assist in diagnosis and treatment of PD
using spatial-temporal gait data.

I. INTRODUCTION
ARKINSON’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system that affects control of
body movement including posture and balance [1]. Gait disturbance, which may present as short, shuffling steps, gait freezing,
lurching unsteady gait, or spontaneous falls, is recognized as a
contributing diagnostic criterion for PD [2], [3]. Despite advances in medical care, gait disturbances are known to worsen

as the disease progresses, contributing to loss of independence,
falls, and poor quality of life [4], [5].
PD is clinically characterized using patient medical history
and neurological examination; however, diagnosis may be difficult in the early stages of the disease, and can often take
many years due to the variability of presenting signs, symptoms,
and frequency. Quantitative assessment of spatial-temporal gait
characteristics in PD patients, including walking speed, stride
length, and double support time, has been previously performed
in an attempt to elucidate gait control pathways affected by
PD, assist in disease diagnosis, and evaluate time-dependent
disease progression [5], [6]. Spatial-temporal gait features may
be measured quickly, easily, and at low cost using technology
such as pressure-sensitive GaitRite mats, or foot switches. In
contrast, 3-D gait analysis requires a considerable amount of
preparation time and costly digital optical motion capture technology [7]. Analysis of spatial-temporal data in gait analysis of
PD patients may therefore be useful in clinics where 3-D gait
analysis technology is not available. At present, however, there
is no established procedure for reliably classifying PD based on
spatial-temporal gait characteristics alone.
Machine learning strategies in human movement, including
neural networks and support vector machines (SVM), have
gained popularity as they offer an objective approach to
identifying or differentiating subgroups of individuals with
movement disorders and quantifying outcomes of surgical or
therapeutic intervention [8]. Using ground reaction force (GRF)
data, PD has been classified with 77.3% accuracy using neural
networks with weighted fuzzy membership functions [9],
84.4% using projection-based learning with a metacognitive
radial basis function (RBF) network [10], and 91.2% using
SVM with chi-square distance kernel [3]. Spatial-temporal gait
features have also been used in SVM approaches to classify
PD with an accuracy of between 75.6% and 90.32% [11]–[13].
While the outcomes of these studies show some promise,
these approaches are inherently limited in their classification
accuracy due to dispersion of raw gait data as a consequence of
variability in patient age and physical features.
Spatial-temporal gait characteristics of an individual are affected by ageing [2], and physical differences between subjects,
including height, body mass, and gender, may increase gait
variability and limit the degree to which pathological trends
may be reliably discerned. Spatial-temporal gait features are
also a function of and are greatly influenced by walking speed
[14]–[16]. In a study of 17 healthy elderly subjects (age 68.9
± 7 years), average self-selected walking speed was 111.92 ±
21.22 cm/s [17] and considerably lower and more variable than
the walking speed of healthy young adults (141.4 ± 3.1 cm/s)
[18]. Greater between-subject variations in walking speed

increases dispersion of spatial-temporal gait variables, and
reduces power to detect between-group differences in a given
gait feature.
Spatial-temporal gait features may also be influenced by
variations in a subject’s own self-selected walking speed,
which may vary substantially in a given testing session [19],
[20]. In a recent study of a young adult subject walking at
their preferred walking speed in seven different laboratories,
the mean self-selected speed varied between 1.38 ± 0.07
and 1.57 ± 0.03 m/s [20]. Ultimately, extrinsic factors such
as laboratory environment and cognitive state may have a
substantial effect on a subject’s self-selected gait speed, and
therefore spatial-temporal gait parameters.
Minimizing the effect of between-subject differences in physical properties and walking speed on spatial-temporal gait data
may reduce data dispersion, leading to improved gait classification accuracy. It has been shown that the accuracy of cerebral
palsy diagnosis using a SVM approach improves from 83.3% to
96.8% when spatial-temporal gait data are first normalized using
leg length and subject age [8]. At present, however, gait normalization in machine learning has received little attention to date in
the extant Parkinsonian gait literature, and the influence of walking speed on gait classification accuracy has not been explored.
The aim of this study was twofold. First, to use a multiple regression (MR) normalization strategy to identify differences in
spatial-temporal gait features between PD patients and controls;
and second, to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning
strategies in classifying PD gait after MR normalization. By
applying a MR normalization to spatial-temporal gait measurements using a range of patient characteristics including age,
height, body mass, gender, and self-selected walking speed,
we hypothesized that classification of pathological gait using
machine learning approaches would significantly more accurate than conventional single-parameter normalization strategies [21]. The results of this study have future implications for
early PD diagnosis strategies, and the way gait may be clinically
evaluated in PD patients.

ing an 8-camera video motion analysis system (Vicon, Oxford
Metrics, Ltd., Oxford), while GRFs were recorded simultaneously using two instrumented force platforms (Kistler, Switzerland and Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc., Watertown,
MA). Video and analog force-plate data were sampled at 100
and 1000 Hz, respectively. Marker data were filtered with a lowpass, fourth-order Butterworth filter using a cut-off frequency of
4 Hz. Approval for the study was obtained from the relevant Human Research Ethics Committees, and written informed consent
was provided according to the Committees’ guidelines.
B. Data Normalization
Spatial-temporal gait features including stride length, step
length, step width, cadence, double support time, stance time,
swing time, step time, and stride time were averaged across
all trials and normalized to subject height using the following
dimensionless (DS) equations reported by Hof [21]:
ln =

lr
D

(1)

fn =

fr

60 × Dg

(2)

tr
tn = 

D
g

where lr and ln represent the raw and normalized gait length
feature, respectively (stride length, step length or step width);
fr and fn represent the raw and normalized gait cadence, respectively; tr and tn represent the raw and normalized gait time
feature, respectively (double support time, stance time, swing
time, step time, or stride time); D is subject height, and g is the
universal gravitational acceleration constant. Spatial-temporal
gait features were normalized using (1)–(3) in both the PD patients and controls. Cadence was divided by 60 to produce units
of steps/second. All normalized gait features were dimensionless.
Spatial-temporal gait data for the PD patients and controls
were also normalized using a MR approach which calculates
the ratio of the original and fitted values as follows:

A. Experimental Protocol
Gait data for 23 PD patients, age: 68.5 ± 6.1 years
(60–80 years), height: 1.8 ± 0.1 m (1.6–1.9 m), body mass:
80.1 ± 15.5 kg (52.3–120.2 kg), male/female: 20/3, were selected retrospectively from an existing database [22]. Gait data
for 26 aged-matched healthy controls, age: 69.5 ± 5.0 years
(60–79 years), height: 1.7 ± 0.1 m (1.6–1.8 m), body mass:
76.7 ± 14.7 kg (55.0–106.4 kg), male/female: 13/13, were acquired from the same laboratory database. PD patients were
mildly affected by the disease (Hoehn and Yahr [23] score of 2)
and were in an optimally medicated state.
Fifteen reflective markers were attached to each subject according to a modified Helen Hayes marker set [24]. Subjects
walked at their preferred walking speed ten times across an
8 m walkway. The average walking speed of the PD patients
and controls was 1.1 ± 0.2 m/s (0.8–1.6 m/s) and 1.2 ± 0.2 m/s
(0.7–1.8 m/s), respectively. Marker positions were measured us-

where ŷi represents the best fitted value from the regression
model for the ith observation and ε̂i represents the observed

residual error for the ith observation. Gait features are normalized by dividing the value of the original dependent gait feature,
yi , by ŷi according to
yin =

yi
ŷi

(6)

where yin represents the normalized gait feature for the ith observation. Using a Taylor’s series expansion, it can be shown
that the expected value of the control group normalized using
this method is 1 (i.e., E(yn ) ≈ 1). The normalized gait feature
is dimensionless as both yi and ŷi have the same units. New
gait data may be subsequently normalized using (6), where ŷi
is the predicted value of the gait data that is obtained from the
regression model.
C. Machine Learning
Five machine learning strategies were employed to classify
PD gait: kernel Fisher discriminant (KFD) [25], naı̈ve Bayesian
approach (BA) [26], k-nearest neighbor (kNN) [27], SVM [28],
and Random Forest (RF) [29]. These machine learning strategies were applied using: 1) raw spatial-temporal gait features;
2) spatial-temporal gait features normalized using the DS equations; and 3) spatial-temporal gait features normalized using the
MR approach. The classifiers’ internal parameters were optimized using exhaustive grid search and tenfold cross-validation
method. RBF kernel was used for both KFD and SVM, where
the grid search ranges used for the cost regularization (C) and
shape (gamma) parameters were from 10–3 to 102 and from 10–3
to 101 , respectively (see the Appendix). All spatial-temporal gait
features were scaled to have zero means and unity variances in
order to avoid the phenomenon of large value dominance [30].
The performance of the machine learning was determined by
evaluating mean accuracy [31] and area under curve (AUC)
[32], where 1 represents perfect classification, and 0.5 represents the worst possible classification.
D. Data Analysis
Variance inflation factors (VIF) for the independent variables
were first computed to examine the multicollinearity among the
subject physical properties and self-selected speed. The VIFs for
all independent variables were found to be less than 5 [33] (see
the Appendix); therefore, all independent variables were considered in development of the MR models. For each gait feature,
backward stepwise elimination was used to select the regression
model where p < 0.1 for all independent variables. Finally, robust fitted models for each gait features were computed using
a “bisquare” weight function [34]. Statistical assumptions including linearity, normality, and homoscedasticity for the MR
models were met for all variables.
Coefficient of variation (CV) was used as a measure of data
dispersion before and after normalizing, and Spearman’s rank
order correlation coefficient (ρ) was used to assess the influence
of speed and physical properties including age, height, and body
mass on the spatial-temporal gait features. To compute the correlations between the gait features and gender, a point biserial
coefficient of correlation method was adopted [35]. 95% con-

fidence intervals and two-tailed student’s t-tests were used to
compare the differences between the control and PD subjects.
Standard error and 95% confidence intervals were computed as
described previously [36]. For multiple comparisons, p-values
were adjusted according to Holm [37]. Statistical significance
was set at p < 0.05. All calculations were performed using
MATLAB R2013b (MathWorks, Natick, MA).
III. RESULTS
Using raw data (i.e., before normalization), the only significant differences in spatial-temporal gait features between the
PD patients and controls were stride length (mean difference:
0.09 m, 95% CI: [0.00, 0.19], p = 0.03), and double support
time (mean difference: 0.09 s, 95% CI: [0.05, 0.13], p < 0.001),
which were significantly smaller in the PD patients [see Fig. 1
(a)]. When the raw data were normalized using the DS equations, significant differences between the PD patients and controls were observed in stride length (mean difference: 0.09, 95%
CI: [0.03, 0.15], p < 0.01), step length (mean difference: 0.03,
95% CI: [0.00, 0.06], p < 0.01), and double support time (mean
difference: 0.23, 95% CI: [0.15, 0.32], p < 0.001) [see Fig. 1
(b)]. After normalizing using the MR approach, stride length
(mean difference: 0.04, 95% CI: [0.00, 0.08], p = 0.03), stance
time (mean difference: 0.06, 95% CI: [0.01, 0.11], p < 0.01),
and double support time (mean difference: 0.39, 95% CI: [0.31,
0.48], p < 0.001) were significantly smaller in the PD patients,
whereas cadence (mean difference: –0.04, 95% CI: [–0.08, –
0.00], p = 0.045) was significantly larger compared to controls
[see Fig. 1(c)].
All raw spatial-temporal gait features were strongly correlated
with speed (|ρ| > 0.68) except swing time (ρ = −0.33) and
step width (ρ = − 0.02), which were weakly correlated (see
Table I). Cadence, stance time, double support time, step time,
and stride time were moderately correlated with age (|ρ| >
0.30). Most temporal gait features were weakly correlated with
height, body mass, and gender (|ρ| < 0.28); however, swing
time was moderately correlated with gender (ρ = 0.35). Step
width was moderately correlated with height, body mass, and
gender (ρ > 0.42), while both stride length and step length had
weak correlations with all physical properties (|ρ| < 0.20).
After normalization using the DS equations, correlations between temporal gait features and age increased (see Table I).
While correlations between all gait features and height, body
mass, and gender remained weak after normalization using the
DS equations (|ρ| < 0.22), moderate correlations were still observed between step width and height, body mass, and gender
(0.35 < |ρ| < 0.47). Spatial-temporal gait features remained
moderately to highly correlated with speed after normalization
using the DS equations.
Normalization using the MR approach reduced most correlations between spatial-temporal gait features and physical
properties to trivial values (ρ < 0.1), although some weak correlations were still observed after normalization (|ρ| < 0.25) (see
Table I). After normalization using the MR approach, spatialtemporal gait features were no longer substantially correlated
with speed (|ρ| < 0.16). Normalization using the MR approach

Point biserial coefficient of correlation computed according to Lev [35].

reduced the dispersion of all spatial-temporal gait features relative to that of the raw data and data normalized using the DS
equations; however, significantly reduced dispersion was observed in stride length, stance time, double support time, step
length, and step time (p < 0.05). Normalization using the DS
equations had little effect on reducing data dispersion, and in
some cases slightly increased dispersion of data (see Table II).
Classification accuracy of PD using machine learning was
lowest when using the raw spatial-temporal data, and highest when the data were normalized using the MR approach
(see Table III). RF yielded a mean classification accuracy of
92.6% in predicting PD gait after data normalization using the
MR approach, whereas the classification accuracies using KFD,

BA, kNN, and SVM after normalization with the MR approach
were 87.4%, 82.0%, 84.4%, and 86.0%, respectively. Machine
learning using BA, kNN, and RF resulted in classification accuracy of less than 80% with raw data or data normalized using
the DS equations; however, KFD when applied to the data normalized using the DS equations resulted in a PD classification
accuracy of 86.2%.
The maximum AUC value (0.96) was determined from SVM
and RF when applied to data normalized using the MR approach,
while an AUC value of 0.95 was obtained from KFD when
applied to data normalised using DS equations. An AUC value of
0.85 was obtained from SVM when applied to the raw data. The
performance of BA, kNN, and RF produced an AUC value of less

than 0.9 when applied to raw data or data normalized using the
DS equations. Optimum machine learning performances (both
classification accuracies and AUC values) were observed when
using data normalized by the MR approach (see the Appendix
for classifier rankings). Specificities and sensitivities of machine
learning are also presented in the Appendix.
IV. DISCUSSION
The aims of this study were to use a MR normalization
strategy to identify differences in spatial-temporal gait features between PD patients and controls, and assess the capacity

of machine learning strategies to classify PD gait after data
normalization. Normalization and classification results were
compared to those obtained using DS equations. Detrending
normalization has also been previously proposed in which a
polynomial model for each gait feature is developed using a
highly correlated physical property such as age or height [38];
however, this method was not used in this study due to the
weak correlations between the gait features and subject physical properties (see Table I). When normalizing data using the
DS equations, only stride length, step length, and double support time were significantly different between the PD patients
and controls; however, normalizing data using the MR approach
revealed significant differences in stride length, cadence, stance
time, and double support time. We hypothesized that MR normalization of spatial-temporal gait data would improve the performance of classification of PD using machine learning compared to the single parameter normalization method. We found
that classification of PD using RF resulted in an accuracy of
92.6% after normalizing gait data using the MR approach, compared to maximum classifier accuracies of 80.4% (SVM) and
86.2% (KFD) using raw data and data normalized using DS
equations, respectively.
We showed that correlations among physical properties,
speed, and gait features explained most of the dispersion
of spatial-temporal gait features, and prevented a number of
pathology-related differences in gait features between PD patients and controls from being discerned. In particular, variations in self-selected speed accounted for the majority of the
dispersion of the gait data (see the Appendix). Normalizing
spatial-temporal gait data using DS equations did not substantially reduce gait data dispersion, and in some cases, actually
increased the data dispersion (see Table II). In contrast, normalizing the data using the MR approach greatly reduced correlations among age, height, body mass, gender, speed, and
spatial-temporal gait features, thus reducing data dispersion,
and significantly improving the performances of machine learning strategies to classify PD gait. The results demonstrate that
MR normalization using patient physical properties and speed
may be used to evaluate gait variability and quantify clinical gait
aberrations associated with PD. This may have implications in
early detection of PD, the monitoring of disease progression,
and in the evaluation of the effectiveness of disease modifying
interventions.
The PD classification accuracy reported in this study was
somewhat higher than some classification accuracies reported
in the literature. We reported that a maximum classification accuracy of 92.6% using RF was obtained after normalizing gait
data with the MR approach. Using SVM and RBF kernels, previous studies have reported PD classification accuracy of 75.6%
using raw gait features including speed, step length, cadence,
and stride time [12], and an accuracy of 89.3% using only raw
temporal gait features [11]. A classification accuracy of 90.32%
was also reported using least-squares SVM on temporal gait features [13]. However, in these studies, datasets were small (<32
subjects), subjects were not age or gender matched, and wide
range of disease severity subjects were included which may have
affected classification accuracy. Larger datasets representative

WAHID et al.: CLASSIFICATION OF PARKINSON’S DISEASE GAIT USING SPATIAL-TEMPORAL GAIT FEATURES

of more severe PD tend to yield higher classification accuracy;
for example, Daliri [3] obtained a PD classification accuracy
of 91.2% using SVM and vertical ground force data from 166
subjects (Hoehn and Yahr score: 2.3 ± 0.3; range: 2–3).
In this study, not all classifiers demonstrated the same performance. For example, SVM yielded maximum classification
accuracy (80.4%) when applied to raw data, whereas maximum
classification accuracy was obtained using KFD (86.2%) and RF
(92.6%) when applied to data normalized using DS and MR, respectively (see Table III). These inconsistent outcomes from the
classifiers may be explained using the “No Free Lunch” theorem [39], which postulates that no algorithm can be uniformly
accurate over all datasets due to the cost function and sample
data characteristics.
We also observed that the classifiers’ mean accuracies did not
proportionally reflect the corresponding AUC measurements.
While AUC provides an overall performance measurement of
the classifiers using varying threshold values, its accuracy provides a measurement of how well a classifier can identify a
pathological gait feature using a certain threshold value (e.g.,
0.5). Using simulations with various sample sizes of up to 1000
observations, a recent study reported that the AUC measurement
for small sample size may be less precise than classifiers’ error
rate [40]. Although the AUC measurements in this study did not
indicate significant improvement in the classifiers’ performance,
which may have been due to the relatively small sample size, the
AUC ranking clearly demonstrates the superior performance of
the classifiers when applied to data normalized using the MR
approach compared to raw data or data normalized using DS
equations (see the Appendix).
There has been some debate in the literature as to how cadence varies in certain PD populations. Two studies reported
significant differences in cadence between PD patients and control subjects; in these two studies, the average speed differences
between the PD and control groups was 0.29 m/s (Hoehn and
Yahr score: 2.4 ± 0.4; range: 2–3) and 0.4 m/s (Hoehn and Yahr
score: 2.3 ± 0.5; range: 1.5–3), respectively [41], [42]. In contrast, two other investigations found no significant difference
in cadence between PD patients and controls; in these studies, the average speed differences between the PD and control
groups was 0.25 m/s (Hoehn and Yahr score: 2.6±0.6; range:
2–3) and 0.22 m/s (Hoehn and Yahr score: 1.6 ± 0.5; range:
1–2), respectively [6], [17]. It is plausible that larger (smaller)
differences in speed between PD patients and controls would
lead to larger (smaller) differences in cadence. However, PD
patients tend to walk with a higher cadence and shorter stride
length than aged-matched controls [43]; therefore, when PD patients and controls are speed matched, differences in cadence
are likely to be more prominent than if PD patients are walking more slowly than controls, i.e., allowing the cadence of PD
patients to more closely match that of the controls. By normalizing spatial-temporal data to self-selected walking speed,
we revealed significant differences in both cadence and stride
length between PD patients and controls.
We further observed that step length was significantly smaller
in PD subjects than in controls after normalization of step length

using DS equations. This was most likely due to the strong positive correlation between speed and step length (ρ = 0.83) which
was increased after normalizing step length using DS equations
(ρ = 0.88). Since the PD subjects walked more slowly than
the control subjects (1.1 versus 1.2 m/s), the difference in step
length between PD subjects and controls became significantly
larger after normalization using DS equations. We believe our
MR normalization approach has the capacity to identify differences in gait features such as cadence and stride length in
pathological gait that would otherwise not be discerned using
raw data alone, or that may be associated with a false-positive
result after normalizing data using DS equations.
There are a number of limitations of this study that ought
to be considered when interpreting the results. First, the MR
models developed were based on a relatively small dataset of
control subjects (n = 26), and some weak correlations between
gait features and physical properties were still present after normalization using the MR approach. A larger number of control
subjects may have improved the reliability of the model’s coefficient estimation and further reduced correlations. Second, the
results presented are representative of one specific age group (elderly subjects, age ranges 60–80 years) and PD severity (Hoehn
and Yahr score of 2). To identify pathological gait features in
PD subjects of a different age group, new regression models
would need to be developed based on aged-matched controls;
however, we believe that the age range of the PD patients tested
in this study represents the majority of PD patients [5]. Finally,
eighteen of the 26 control subjects recruited had a body mass
index (BMI) of 25 or greater. We observed that step width in the
control subjects was moderately influenced by body mass when
a subject’s BMI was over 25 (ρ = 0.65), while step width was
only weakly influenced by body mass when BMI was below 25
(ρ = 0.27). Since temporal gait features have been shown to be

significantly reduced correlations among gait features, physical
properties, and the speed, thus facilitating high PD classification accuracy using machine learning. The results show that
normalization of spatial-temporal gait features has the capacity to reveal specific disease-related gait features not present in
raw data. This study has important implications for analysis of
spatial-temporal gait data in diagnosis of PD and evaluation of
PD severity.

Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were calculated using true-positive rates (sensitivity) and false positive
rates (1-specificity) at various threshold points of the classifiers
for spatial-temporal gait data from PD subjects and controls (see

strategies: KFD, SVM, kNN, naı̈ve BA, and RF (see Fig. 2). Machine learning strategies were applied to raw spatial-temporal
gait data, spatial-temporal data normalized using DS equations,
and spatial-temporal data normalized using a MR approach.

increased the dispersion of the data and affected calculation of
the regression model coefficients. Modeling the control subject
independently of overweight individuals may further improve
classification accuracy.
This study reported a MR normalization approach that incorporated patient physical properties and self-selected speed. This
approach minimized spatial-temporal gait data dispersion, and

ascending order from 1 to 15 (see Table V). These results
indicate that the optimum machine learning performance was
obtained when data were normalized using the MR approach.
Specificities and sensitivities of these classifiers for all three data
types were also computed (see Table VI). General dominance
methodology [45] was adopted to compute the relative contribution of each independent variable to the observed variation of
gait features (see Table VII). Correlations among the physical
properties and speed were computed (see Table VIII), as well
as VIF for each of these variables (see Table IX). Regression
models were computed using the backward stepwise elimination method where the selection criterion used was Akaike’s
information criterion. Robust fitted models were finally computed using a “bisquare” weight function (see Table X) [34].
An exhaustive grid search and tenfold cross validation was used
to compute the classifiers’ optimum internal parameters (see
Table XI).
