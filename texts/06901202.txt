Infarction From the Inverse Solution of Equivalent
Current Density in Pathological Hearts
Zhaoye Zhou, Chengzong Han, Ting Yang, and Bin He∗ , Fellow, IEEE

Abstract—We propose a new approach to noninvasively image
the 3-D myocardial infarction (MI) substrates based on equivalent
current density (ECD) distribution that is estimated from the body
surface potential maps (BSPMs) during S-T segment. The MI substrates were identified using a predefined threshold of ECD. Computer simulations were performed to assess the performance with
respect to: 1) MI locations; 2) MI sizes; 3) measurement noise; 4)
numbers of BSPM electrodes; and 5) volume conductor modeling
errors. A total of 114 sites of transmural infarctions, 91 sites of
epicardial infarctions, and 36 sites of endocardial infarctions were
simulated. The simulation results show that: 1) Under 205 electrodes and 10-μV noise, the averaged accuracies of imaging transmural MI are 83.4% for sensitivity, 82.2% for specificity, 65.0%
for Dice’s coefficient, and 6.5 mm for distances between the centers of gravity (DCG). 2) For epicardial infarction, the averaged
imaging accuracies are 81.6% for sensitivity, 75.8% for specificity,
45.3% for Dice’s coefficient, and 7.5 mm for DCG; while for endocardial infarction, the imaging accuracies are 80.0% for sensitivity,
77.0% for specificity, 39.2% for Dice’s coefficient, and 10.4 mm for
DCG. 3) A reasonably good imaging performance was obtained
under higher noise levels, fewer BSPM electrodes, and mild volume conductor modeling errors. The present results suggest that
this method has the potential to aid in the clinical identification of
the MI substrates.

I. INTRODUCTION
YOCARDIAL infarction (MI) is a major public health
problem that is usually caused by the occlusion of
coronary arteries [1]. MI increases the risk of sudden cardiac
death by creating electrophysiological abnormal substrate responsible for triggering life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
Thus, the identification of the MI substrate bears diagnostic and

therapeutic importance for the clinical management of cardiac
arrhythmias. Efforts have been made toward the development
of invasive and noninvasive diagnostic tools, including biochemical markers, single-photon emission, computed tomography, echocardiography [2], delay-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging [3], as well as catheter mapping techniques [4].
Among these clinical techniques, the catheter mapping method
is capable of defining the MI substrate based on the direct electrophysiological recordings of the myocardial tissue. However,
such invasive technique require prolonged procedures and may
put patients at risk of sudden cardiac death [5]. By contrast, the
noninvasive cardiac electrical imaging (CEI) technique utilizes
the body surface ECG to reconstruct the cardiac electrical activities; thus, it is able to bypass the aforementioned limitations and
possesses the potential to delineate the MI substrate based on
electrical properties and further to assist in the clinical treatment
of substrate-related heart arrhythmias.
In the past decades, many efforts have been made to develop such noninvasive CEI techniques. By solving the ECG
inverse problem, the electrical activities can be reconstructed
by coupling the body surface potential maps (BSPMs) and
subject-specific geometric models. These methods include moving dipoles localization [6]–[9], epicardial potential imaging
[10]–[16], and heart surface activation sequence imaging [17]–
[20]. Recently, much effort has been made to extend the ECG inverse problem to image the cardiac electrical activity throughout
the 3-dimensional (3-D) myocardium [21]–[40]. Among these
studies, a physical-model-based 3-D cardiac electrical imaging (3-DCEI) approach has been proposed to mathematically
model the cardiac electrical activity in 3-D myocardial volume
using equivalent current density (ECD) distribution without the
needs of a priori information of cardiac electrophysiology [29].
Both the computer simulations [29], [32] and animal experiments [32], [36], [37] showed the promises of this approach
for extracting 3-D cardiac activation sequence from the inverse
solution of ECD distribution.
In this study, we propose a new method to noninvasively
image and localize the MI substrate based on physically modeling the cardiac electrical sources by using the distributed ECD
model throughout the 3-D myocardium. ECD distributions during S-T segment are inversely estimated and used to identify the
MI substrate. We performed a series of computer simulations
to comprehensively evaluate the proposed method. The noninvasively identified MI substrates were quantitatively compared
with the simulated MI substrates to assess the performance.

the ECD distribution to the body surface measurements. This
linear inverse problem was solved using the weighted minimum
norm estimation [45], [46], [29], which minimizes the following
objective function:
min(||Φ(t) − LJ(t)||22 + λ||W J(t)||22 )

II. METHODS
A. Principles of Imaging MI Substrates From
ECD Distribution

Φ(t) = LJ(t)

where W is the Kronecker product of a 3 × 3 identity matrix
I,and an N × N diagonal matrix Ω. λ is the regularization parameter, which can be determined by the L-curve method [47].
Therefore, the ECD distribution at time t can be estimated as
Jest (t) with its amplitude denoted as |Jest (t)|. It is noted that the
solution of the linear inverse problem leads to a smoothed distribution of ECD, especially at areas with a large ECD magnitude.
Due to the spatial smoothness effect of the inverse operator, the
spatial distribution of the estimated ECD would mostly likely
overlap with each other. The tissue volume within the MI would
most likely have a large ECD relative to the normal tissue outside the MI area due to the spatial summing of ECD within a
confined MI area. Hereby, the MI substrate and the edge would
have a ECD magnitude higher than the normal tissue during the
S-T segment and, thus, can be quantified by setting a predefined
threshold. The threshold can be defined as a certain percentage
of the spatial ECD maximum magnitude, expressed as
Threshold = ∂ ∗ arg max(|Jave |)

MI is caused by the blockage of coronary blood supply followed by subsequent remodeling processes, which create substrates with altered electrophysiological properties in terms of
low action potential amplitude [41]. This results in infarcted tissues, which are considered electrically unexcitable throughout
the whole cardiac cycle or with much smaller action potential
amplitude as compared with the normal action potential. During S-T segment, the transmembrane potential (TMP) of normal
myocardial cells rises to the plateau potential, while the TMP
of infarcted myocardial cells remains in low potential [41]. This
creates a voltage difference and, thus, the high magnitude of the
spatial gradient of TMP surrounding the MI border, as shown in
Fig. 1(d). In addition to TMP, this important feature of the TMP
spatial gradient during S-T segment provides an alternative way
to characterize the MI substrates. According to the bidomain
theory [42], the local ECD at each myocardial site is defined
to be proportional to the TMP spatial gradient, and therefore,
the MI substrates could be identified from the ECD distribution
throughout the myocardium during the S-T segment.
In the proposed method, the distributed ECD model was used
to represent the cardiac electrical source throughout the myocardium. Given a tessellated geometrical heart-torso model
and the prior knowledge of the electrical conductivity of relevant tissues and organs [43], [44], the relationship between the
ECD distribution and the measurable body surface potentials
can be described by the following linear equation:
(1)

where Φ(t) is an M × 1 column vector of body surface potentials from M body surface electrodes at time t, J(t) is a
3N × 1 column vector of ECD distribution from N myocardial
grid points, and L is the M × 3N transfer matrix that relates

(2)

(3)

where ∂ is the predefined threshold and |Jave | is the temporal
average of 30 ms of the |Jest (t)| inversely estimated from ST BSPM. In this study, myocardial tissue with a |Jave | that
is higher than the threshold is identified as the substrate of
infarction.
B. Computer Simulation
To assess the performance of the proposed method, a series of
computer simulations were performed using a cellular automaton heart model as used in previous studies [22], [23], [24] to
simulate the ventricular electrical activity during MI. The spatial
resolution of the ventricular model was 1.5 mm. The electrical
properties of the myocardial tissue were defined based on the
knowledge of cardiac anatomy and electrophysiology [24], [25].
Specifically in the heart excitation model, the excitation conduction velocity for the infarcted unit is set to 0 m/s so that no tissue
in the area will be activated. MI tissue is modeled with an action potential of constant zero. As isolated right ventricle (RV)
infarction only occurs in 3% of MI patients and may not significantly alter the cardiac output, it is considered to be less critical
in clinical applications compared with the left ventricle (LV)
infarction [48], [49]. Therefore, the computer simulations were
performed in LV. The LV myocardium was divided into 17 segment based on the American Heart Association standard [50].
This heart model was embedded in a realistic geometry inhomogeneous heart-torso volume conductor model [22]–[23], and
body surface potentials were generated based on forward computation. The ECD was then reconstructed from BSPM during
S-T segment with a time window of 30 ms and averaged over
time. The MI substrate was defined based on the predefined
threshold.

In total, 114 transmural MI substrates were simulated with
different sizes and various locations throughout the entire LV.
Single or a combination of multiple neighborhood segments
were selected as the infarcted tissue with altered electrophysiological properties. There were 26 anterior infarctions, 41 lateral
infarctions, 20 posterior infarctions, 21 septal infarctions, and 6
apical infarctions, with the size ranging from 5.1% to 38.2% of
the LV volume.
Computer simulations were also conducted to assess the performance of the proposed approach in identifying nontransmural
MI substrates located at the epicardium and the endocardium.
We simulated 91 epicardial infarctions and 36 endocardial infarctions at various LV locations, with a thickness of approximately 1/3–1/2 of the transmural MI substrates. The sizes of
the epicardial infarctions ranged from 5.6% to 22.9% of the LV
volume, while the sizes of the endocardial infarctions varied
from 4.4% to 14.9% of the LV volume.
To investigate the effect of noise level on the proposed
method, the forward calculated BSPMs were contaminated by
Gaussian white noise (GWN) with different noise levels of 0,
5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 μV assuming that the peak to peak value
of sinus BSPM is 3 mV though we are mapping MI substrates
from S-T segment. Meanwhile, we used different numbers of
electrodes (256, 205, 182, 156, and 98) to examine the effect of
electrode density on the proposed method with additive 10-μV
level GWN. The effect of volume conductor modeling errors
was also studied by adding 10% torso geometry uncertainty and
4-mm heart position uncertainty.
C. Statistical Analysis
Four parameters were computed to quantify the performance
of the proposed method: sensitivity, specificity, Dice’s coefficient, and distance between the centers of gravities (DCG).
Sensitivity represents the percentage of the accurately estimated
infarction in the true infarction, and specificity represents the
percentage of the accurately estimated normal region in the
true normal tissue. Dice’s coefficient compares the similarity
between the real infarction and the estimated infarction. They
are defined as: sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN) and specificity =
TN/(TN + FP), Dice’s coefficient = 2TP/(TP + FN + TP + FP),
in which true positive (TP) is the volume of true infarction that is
correctly identified as infarction, false negative (FN) is the volume of true infarction that is mistakenly considered as normal
tissue, true negative (TN) is the volume of true normal tissue
that is correctly identified as normal, and false positive (FP) is
the volume of normal tissue that is mistakenly characterized as
infarction. DCG is defined as the Euclidean distance between
the gravity center of the estimated infarction and that of the true
infarction.
III. RESULTS
A. Transmural Infarctions
Fig. 2 depicts examples of imaging the transmural MI substrates that were located at the anterior, posterior, lateral, septal,
and apical walls of the LV, with various sizes. The simulation

was performed with 205 surface electrodes and 10-μV additive
GWN. The normal tissue, the simulated true infarction, and the
overlap between simulated infarction and imaged infarction,
and the estimated infarction are shown in transparent silver,
solid red, solid yellow, and solid gray, respectively. As shown
in Fig. 2, with different sizes and anatomical locations, the imaged MI substrates were in good consistency with the simulated
MI substrates. The overall performance was evaluated from 114
simulated transmural MI substrates, and on average, sensitivity
was 83.4% ± 16.7%, specificity was 82.2% ± 12.9%, Dice’s
coefficient was 65.0% ± 12.9%, and DCG was 6.5 ± 3.5 mm,
based on a 50% threshold.
Fig. 3(a) compares the effect of transmural infarction sizes
on the inverse results. In general, smaller infarction size led to
higher sensitivity and specificity, lower DCG, but lower Dice’s
coefficient, suggesting a bigger portion of infarction was accurately identified at the price of over expanded estimation. Specifically, when the size decreased from 30% of the LV volume to
10% of the LV volume, the averaged sensitivity increased from
75.1% to 96.5%, the averaged DCG decreases by 1.5 mm, and
the averaged Dice’s coefficient decreased by 22%. Regardless
of the geometrical size, this method was able to identify more
than 75% of the infarcted tissue in terms of sensitivity with a
localization error around 7 mm. The result indicated that our
method was capable of identifying the dominating infarction
substrate with various infarction sizes.
We also investigated the effect of MI locations on the imaging
performance. The locations of infarctions have been classified
into five groups based on their anatomical locations: anterior, lateral, posterior, septal, and apical regions. Fig. 4(a) summarizes
the results based on the locations of transmural infarctions. On
average, the anterior infarctions obtained 11.6% higher sensitivity (86.5% versus 74.9%) and 1.9 mm lower DCG (6.1 versus
8.2 mm) than posterior infarctions. The lateral infarctions also
presented relatively higher accuracy than the septal infarctions
in terms of sensitivity (92.3% versus 66.6%) and DCG (5.6
versus 6.6 mm). The results of the apical infarction gave an
intermediate DCG (7.7 mm) and a much higher sensitivity of
96.7%. The results suggested that our method was feasible to
image MI substrates at diversified locations throughout LV.

B. Epicardial and Endocardial Infarctions
To assess the feasibility of identifying superficial infarctions,
we simulated a total of 127 surface infarctions in LV, including 91 epicardial infarctions and 36 endocardial infarctions,
assuming 205 surface BSPM electrodes and 10-μV GWN. The
epicardial infarctions and endocardial infarctions were distinguished by the location of the maximum ECD magnitude. Fig. 5
gives representative examples of imaging epicardial infarctions
located at anterolateral LV [see Fig. 5(a)] and endocardial infarction located also at anterolateral LV [see Fig. 5(b)]. The estimated nontransmural infarctions were closely consistent with
the true infarctions, with a sensitivity of 81.8% and 85.7%, respectively, for these cases. Their positions on the myocardium
(epicardial versus endocardial) were also successfully identified

by localizing the spatially maximal ECD magnitude [Fig. 5,
black asterisks].
The average accuracies of 91 epicardial infarctions were
81.6% ± 15.4% for sensitivity, 75.8% ± 15% for specificity,
45.3% ± 7.4% for Dice’s coefficient, and 7.5 ± 2.8 mm for
DCG. Among the 91 epicardial cases, 65 of them (71%) have
been successfully recognized to be epicardial infarctions as the
corresponding maximal ECD magnitude locates at the LV epi-

cardium. This method provided a better performance in localizing anterior epicardial infarctions and lateral epicardial infarctions: 80% of the anterior infarctions and 82% of the lateral infarctions were recognized correctly as on the epicardium.
Similar to transmural infarctions, a smaller size leads to larger
sensitivity and specificity, lower DCG, but a slight decrease in
Dice’s coefficient [Fig. 3(b)]. Fig. 4(b) summarizes the results
with respect to infarction locations. A better performance was

obtained from the anterior and lateral epicardium in terms of
sensitivity than the posterior and septal infarctions.
We further investigated in total 36 endocardial infarctions
with an averaged sensitivity of 80.0% ± 15.1%, specificity of
77.0% ± 9.5%, Dice’s coefficient of 39.2% ± 5.5%, and DCG
of 10.4 ± 2.9 mm. A total of 22 out of the 36 (61%) cases have
been successfully identified as endocardial infarctions. Similar
to transmural and epicardial infarctions, the sensitivity of endocardial infarctions increased with reducing size at the cost
of decreased Dice’s coefficient [Fig. 3(c)], and were locationdependent [Fig. 4(c)]. Note that the sizes of the endocardial
infarctions are much smaller as compared to the transmural infarctions. The performance of the proposed method varied when
imaging the infarct at different transmural depth. Compared
with endocardial infarcts, the epicardial infarcts were estimated
with smaller localization error (DCG: 7.5 versus 10.4 mm) and
slightly higher accuracies (sensitivity: 81.6% versus 80.0%).
Moreover, nontransmural infarctions were more challenging
than the transmural infarctions, which were reflected by generally higher averaged sensitivity and specificity, and lower DCG.
C. Effects of Noise Level, Electrode Number, and
Geometry Uncertainty
The effect of the measurement noise was evaluated by adding
six different noise levels (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 μV) to 205
channels of BSPM. Fig. 6(a) shows the sensitivity, specificity,
Dice’s coefficient, and DCG averaged over 114 transmural infarcts with various noise levels. While a higher noise level led
to a slight decrease of sensitivity, specificity and Dice’s coefficient, and a slight increase of the DCG, the overall performance
of the proposed approach was still robust under different noise
levels. As the noise level increases four times from 5 to 20 μV,
the performance decreased by only 1.4% in terms of sensitivity,
4.9% in terms of specificity, 8.6% in terms of Dice’s coefficient,
and 2.1 mm in terms of DCG. Even under a high noise level of
30 μV, the proposed method can still identify on average over
75.1% of the infarct with averaged DCG of around 10 mm.
We also evaluated the effect of the electrode number on the
imaging performance by using 256, 205, 182, 156, and 98 body
surface electrodes under 10-μV noise from 114 transmural MIs.
The electrode arrays were evenly distributed over anterior chest
and posterior chest. Fig. 7 illustrates an example of 182 electrodes (11 × 10 on the anterior and 9 × 8 on the posterior). More
specifically, there is a 9 × 7 array on the anterior chest and a
7 × 5 array on the posterior for 98 electrodes; 10 × 10 on the anterior and 8 × 7 on the posterior for 156 electrodes; 12 × 10 on
anterior and 11 × 8 on the posterior (with the top 3 electrodes on
the back omitted) for 205 electrodes; and 13 × 12 array on the
anterior and 10 × 10 array on the posterior for 256 electrodes.
Fig. 6(b) suggests while more electrodes generally provides better performance, reasonable results were still obtained with less
electrodes. The performance under 98 electrodes was comparable to 205 electrodes, which was supported by the similar obtained sensitivities (81.8% versus 83.4%), specificities (82.8%
versus 82.2%), Dice’s coefficients (61.1% versus 65.0%), and
DCG (7.4 versus 6.5 mm), respectively.

473

The effects of the volume conductor modeling errors were
further assessed by including torso geometry uncertainty and
heart position uncertainty. The heart position was shifted by
4 mm from left to right (error A) or from the front to back (error
B), while the torso volume was either expanded (error C) or
reduced (error D) by 10%. We also investigated the situation of
combining 10% dilation of the torso geometry with 4 mm rightward transition of the heart (error A and C). Fig. 6(c) shows that
our method still possessed reasonable robustness against aforementioned modeling errors. And even in the worst case, with the
existence of both geometry error and heart position shifting (error A and C), this method still obtained a reasonable sensitivity
of 78.3%, a specificity of 80.8%, a Dice’s coefficient of 59.4%,
and DCG of 9.8 mm, averaging over 114 transmural infarcts.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this study, we have developed a new method for noninvasive imaging of the MI substrates based on physically modeling the cardiac electrical sources using the ECD distribution
throughout the ventricular myocardium during the S-T segment.
Comprehensive computer simulation studies were performed by
simulating a number of transmural infarctions, epicardial infarctions, and endocardial infarctions. The simulation results indicated that: 1) Under 10-μV GWN, the transmural infarction can
be identified with an average sensitivity of 83.4%, specificity
of 82.2%, Dice’s coefficient of 65.0%, and DCG of 6.5 mm
over 114 cases, respectively; 2) the present method can reasonably provide the information with respect to the substrate
depth (epicardium versus endocardium); and 3) a reasonably
good imaging performance can still be obtained under various
noise levels, fewer BSPM electrodes, and mild volume conductor modeling errors, respectively. The method gives comparable
or even superior performance in terms of overall accuracies as
compared to the previous study [35].
The present simulation study provides a quantitative and
comprehensive evaluation on the performance of the proposed
method by simulating a number of transmural and nontransmural MI with various sizes and locations. Although not tested
using experimental data, the computer simulation results suggest the potential clinical applicability of the present method
to noninvasively identify the MI substrate throughout the 3D myocardium within one cardiac cycle. The identification of
the MI substrate and its border zone may have a great clinical
interest due to the role of border zone in initiating the lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmias. Compared with other clinical
imaging modalities, the sequential mapping technique defines
the MI substrate in an electrophysiological way but is only
able to give 2-D surface representation instead of volumetric
geometry [5]. By contrast, the proposed method suggests the
potential to provide 3-D volumetric information of MI substrate
and further delineates the geometry of border zone instead of
being limited to the endocardial surface. Compared with conventional ECG recording, the method is able to provide a direct
visualization on the location and geometry of the MI substrate.
In this study, the simulation results show that this proposed
method is able to localize the surface location in 71% epicardial

infarctions and in 61% endocardial infarctions and, thus, suggests the potential to differentiate between epicardial and endocardial infarctions and to provide assistive information to
ablation procedures in the clinical condition. Noted that the
identification of epicardial vs. endocardial infarction is based on
the location of maximal ECD magnitude, which is independent
from the selection of threshold. While imaging nontransmural
infarctions possessed more challenges than imaging transmural infarctions, the present method still achieved a reasonable
performance for the epicardial infarction (sensitivity = 81.6%,
specificity = 75. 8%, Dice’s coefficient = 45.3%, and DCG
= 7.5 mm) and endocardial infarction (sensitivity = 80.0%,
specificity = 77.0%, Dice’s coefficient = 39.2%, and DCG =
10.4 mm). Such results suggest that the ECD-based method may
have the potential to noninvasively and quantitatively estimate
nontransmural infarctions and provide information on source
depth.
The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate an ECDbased approach for quantifying the MI substrates in the heart. A
few simplified assumptions have been used in computer simulation, while the reliability of model validation has been retained.
We have assumed a constant zero for the potential at the simulated substrate, while in reality, a relative complex action potential featured by a low amplitude as compared with the normal
tissue would be expected. The assumption on action potential
has simplified the computer simulation while retained the feature of potential gradient at the border zone at the plateau phase.
We have used realistic geometry volume conductor model
and piece-wise homogeneous boundary element model (BEM)
in the simulation process. The BEM model was consisted of
torso, lungs, heart muscle, the LV and RV blood cavities, with
conductivity values of 0.21, 0.05, 0.21, and 0.67 s/m, respectively. Considering that in the volume conductor model, the

infarction area has a conductivity of 0 s/m, so it may affect the
forward computation of BSPM if this is not taken into account.
To address the issue, we simulated the situations that MI regions
are having zero electrical conductivity with the aid of the finite
element method (FEM). Specifically, in addition to the similar
setting above, for infarction area, the electrical conductivity was
chosen to be zero in the FEM model. We have also simulated infarctions with 1.5-mm-thick ischemic border zone as well. The
electrical conductivity of the border zone in the FEM model was
chosen to be 1/10 of the normal tissue in the longitudinal direction and 1/1000 in the transverse direction. We used such FEMgenerated BSPM and estimated MI with BEM-based inverse
procedure in two infarction cases: anterior infarction and lateral
infarction. The anterior infarction was imaged with a sensitivity
of 90.1%, specificity of 91.3%, Dice’s coefficient of 71.2%,
and DCG of 3.5 mm. The anterior infarction with ischemia was
imaged with a sensitivity of 91.2%, specificity of 90.5%, Dice

a sensitivity of 92.6%, specificity of 90.3%, Dice of 57.6%, and
DCG of 3.2 mm. The imaging result of FEM-generated lateral
infarction is also comparable to the result obtained with BEMgenerated BSPM (sensitivity = 97.0%, specificity = 95.5%,
Dice = 64.6%, and DCG = 2.4 mm). These results suggest
that ignoring the electrical conductivity value in our computer
simulations does not significantly impact the simulation results.
This also suggests that simulating the MI substrate using zero
action potential may provide a reasonable approximation.
In this study, the selection of threshold would affect the volume of the estimated infarction. We have chosen a 50% threshold
to quantify the MI substrate and corresponding computer simulations were performed to evaluate the selection of threshold. For
114 cases of transmural infarction, the MI substrates have been
quantified with different thresholds ranging from 30% to 90%.
And the Corresponding mean sensitivity, specificity, Dice’s coefficient, and DCG achieved with different thresholds were computed and illustrated in Fig. 8. The simulation outcome suggests
that the 50% threshold is an appropriate choice at which the
method would achieve reasonably good performance in terms
of the four parameters.
V. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have proposed a novel method for noninvasive imaging of the MI substrate throughout the 3-D myocardium using the ECD model. The comprehensive computer
simulation results suggest that the proposed method may have
the potential to noninvasively estimate transmural and surface
infarction, and to provide information with respect to epicardial
infarction and endocardial infarction.
