Abstract—The paper presents the development of a computeraided diagnostic (CAD) system for the early detection of endometrial cancer. The proposed CAD system supports reproducibility
through texture feature standardization, standardized multifeature selection, and provides physicians with comparative distributions of the extracted texture features. The CAD system was
validated using 516 regions of interest (ROIs) extracted from
52 subjects. The ROIs were equally distributed among normal and
abnormal cases. To support reproducibility, the RGB images were
first gamma corrected and then converted into HSV and YCrCb.
From each channel of the gamma-corrected YCrCb, HSV, and
RGB color systems, we extracted the following texture features:
1) statistical features (SFs), 2) spatial gray-level dependence matrices (SGLDM), and 3) gray-level difference statistics (GLDS).
The texture features were then used as inputs with support vector machines (SVMs) and the probabilistic neural network (PNN)
classifiers. After accounting for multiple comparisons, texture features extracted from abnormal ROIs were found to be significantly
different than texture features extracted from normal ROIs. Compared to texture features extracted from normal ROIs, abnormal
ROIs were characterized by lower image intensity, while variance,
entropy, and contrast gave higher values. In terms of ROI classification, the best results were achieved by using SF and GLDS
features with an SVM classifier. For this combination, the proposed
CAD system achieved an 81% correct classification rate.

I. INTRODUCTION
MONG the female population of the United States, endometrial cancer is the most frequent cancer associated
with the genital system. In the United States in 2013 it was estimated that over 49 560 new cases would have been diagnosed
with gynecological cancer of the uterine corpus with an associated estimate of 8190 deaths [1]. Early and accurate diagnosis
of the endometrial cancer is of paramount importance.
Hysteroscopy is considered to be the gold standard technique
for the diagnosis of intrauterine pathology, once symptoms or
sonographic evidence are suspicious for intrauterine neoplasia
[2], [3].

During the exam, the gynecologist guides the hysteroscope
connected to a medical camera inside the uterine cavity via the
cervical canal. New endoscopic systems provide excellent visualization and magnification of subtle lesions [4]. Post- or perimenopausal bleeding is the most frequent symptom demanding
hysteroscopy and endometrial curettage. Endometrial precancerous changes, especially in atrophic endometrium such as in
the menopausal state, are difficult to diagnose even during hysteroscopic evaluation.
Hysteroscopic video/images direct the surgeon according to
his or her training, knowledge and experience, empirically to
evaluate the suspected regions of interest (ROIs) and take biopsies. This subjective approach can be supported by a computeraided diagnostic (CAD) system, which eventually may increase
diagnostic accuracy. An in situ, real-time, quantitative analysis
of the endometrial video/images could assist the endoscopist to
recognize and isolate abnormal ROIs with higher probability.
Our group has proposed a standardized protocol to be
followed for texture feature analysis of endoscopic images
during hysteroscopy [5]. It was shown that: 1) gamma corrected images gave significantly better approximations to the
calibrated images; 2) there was no significant difference in
texture features between the panoramic and close up views and
between small angles of the telescope; and 3) significant texture
differences were found between texture features extracted from
normal versus abnormal ROIs. Fig. 1 illustrates normal and
abnormal ROIs of hysteroscopic images of the endometrium. In
general, normal ROIs have higher gray scale median, are more
homogeneous, and have lower contrast when compared to the
abnormal ROIs [5].
The objective of this study was to develop a CAD system
able to differentiate between normal and abnormal endometrial
tissue in the early stages of endometrial cancer based on color
texture analysis in hysteroscopic imaging.
Preliminary studies were published by our group in [5]–[7]
where the usefulness of color texture analysis in differentiating
between normal and abnormal endometrium ROIs was demonstrated. However, in this paper an integrated system covering
all steps of CAD processing (video capture, gamma correction,
multiscale texture analysis, feature extraction and selection, and
classification) are demonstrated. Classification of hysteroscopy
images of the endometrium using texture and vessel descriptors was recently published by Vlachokosta et al. [8] showing
very promising results. Sheraizin and Sheraizin [9] proposed
a hardware calibration protocol, for contrast improvement of
hysteroscopic imaging with very good results according to the
experts. A method of hysteroscopy video summarization and
browsing based on the Jeffrey divergence of the color histograms
of the consecutive frames was proposed by Scharcanski et al.
[10], [11]. It was shown that this adaptive method identified
associated key frames with less false positives (i.e., not

the analysis of normal and abnormal ROIs for the SF, SGLDM, and GLDS texture feature sets using the Y channel. The light gray column (green) of the feature
map is used to illustrate the normal region, whereas the dark gray column (red) the abnormal region. It is shown that: (i) the normal ROI (N) investigated is within
the normal bounds for the SF Med, SF variance, SGLDM contrast and GLDS entropy features; (ii) the abnormal ROI (A) investigated is within the normal bounds
for the feature SF variance, but is out of the normal bounds (i.e. it falls in the abnormal regions) for the features SF median, SGLDM contrast, and GLDS entropy.
The ROI classification results of the SVM classifier are shown on the lower part of the figure. It is illustrated that both the normal and abnormal ROIs under
investigation were correctly classified.

clinically relevant segments, evaluated on 11 videos). Furthermore, a virtual hysteroscopy/laparoscopy system covering the
aspects of collision detection, deformation computation, and
path planning was proposed [12].

Compared to prior research, the fundamental innovations in
the proposed research include:
1) Early cancer detection: The current study focuses on the
detection of abnormal cases associated with occult cancer

NEOFYTOU et al.: COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS IN HYSTEROSCOPIC IMAGING

1131

conditions at the earlier stages of initial cellular change to
malignancy. This unique focus of our current study into the
earlier cancer stages enables early detection and treatment
prior to significant progression of the disease. In contrast,
Vlachokosta et al. [8] had focused on later cancer stage
cases that included the formation of neoangiogenesis and
vessels structures that are associated with more advanced
stages of carcinogenesis.
2) Reproducibility through standardization: Images extracted through hysteroscopy images can exhibit significant differences due to lighting variations and differences in viewing conditions. The current paper extends
the standardized protocol reported in [5] for RGB images
to YCrCb and HSV color spaces. The standardization process supports future integration of results from different
clinics.
3) Standardized multifeature selection: Following standardization, we report texture features that exhibit significant
differences between normal and abnormal ROIs based on
the use of multicomparison methods.
4) CAD system advantages: The proposed system provides
feedback to the physicians regarding the distribution of
texture feature values associated with both normal and abnormal cases (see Fig. 1). Thus, our approach is to improve
the standard practice of using visual inspection to determine regions for histology to a better informed approach
that relies on statistical differences between standardized
texture features from a clinically verified database.
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section II presents
the methodology. Section III presents the results, and Section
IV presents the discussion.
II. METHODOLOGY
In this section, the components of the proposed hysteroscopy
imaging system are presented. A snapshot of the CAD system
is demonstrated in Fig. 1. Moreover, a standardized protocol
to support CAD in hysteroscopy (as well as in endoscopy and
laparoscopy) image analysis is given in Fig. 2.
The original protocol described in [5] has been extended from
covering RGB to include HSV and YCrCb. Furthermore, the
new method includes ROI classification and reporting/diagnosis.
The extensions from RGB to HSV and YCrCb allowed us to investigate more sophisticated color spaces that are associated
with human perception [13]. In fact, as we shall describe in
the Section III, the use of YCrCb gave the best classification results. Furthermore, the development of an ROI classification system provides the CAD system advantages detailed in Section I.
Overall, the revised system includes the following components:
1) calibration and color correction estimation parameters; 2)
video acquisition, ROI selection, and color correction; 3) texture analysis and classification (new); and 4) reporting/diagnosis
(new).
A. Dataset
A total of 40 videos were recorded from 40 patients:
1) 18 patients with postmenopausal uterine bleedings and/or

color correction, video acquisition, texture analysis and classification, and diagnosis. This protocol was updated from previously published protocols by our
group in [5], [7], and [26].

suspected endometrial lesions, and 2) 22 patients with normal
endometrium. The mean age was 54.5 years (range 47–62). The
patients underwent a routine examination procedure covering
family history, clinical examination and transvaginal ultrasound
evaluation. In 16 (40%) patients, endometrial lesions-like polyps
and myomas were diagnosed and suspected to be the cause for
abnormal bleedings. Diagnostic and operative hysteroscopy was
performed under general anesthesia.
Initially, the expert surgeon performed a visual classification
of suspect, normal endometrium regions. To verify the benign
classification, we additionally performed three biopsies of the
endometrium and endometrial curettage (blind scratch of the
endometrium). When expert visual classification suggested endometrial pathology like polyps, myomas, erosion, or atrophy,
biopsies were taken from the lesion as well as from the surrounding regions considered normal.
The videos were recorded and analyzed by the CAD system.
From these videos, 416 ROIs of 64 × 64 pixels were cropped
and classified into two categories based on the opinion of the

1132

physician: 1) for the normal case (N = 208) and 2) for the
abnormal case (N = 208). These cases were further verified
based on the results of the histopathological examination. In order to investigate the accuracy of our classification approach, we
also extracted an additional 100 ROIs using 50 ROIs extracted
from ten normal cases and another 50 ROIs extracted from two
abnormal cases.
B. Video Recording
Digital video images were acquired using the KARL STORZ
Camera system [14], which included a luminance source and
monitor. The camera was white balanced based on the manufacturer guidelines. The camera had an analog output signal (PAL
475 horizontal lines) that was digitized at 720 × 576 pixels using the VCE-PRO frame grabber [15] (24 bits color at 25 frames
per second).
C. Multiscale and Texture Feature Extraction
We also investigated the use of different image scales as
previously reported in [16]. Here, following low-pass filtering,
each ROI was downsampled at rates that varied from 2 × 2 to
9 × 9.
A unique characteristic of our dataset comes from the need to
characterize color texture content of the ROIs. We are thus led to
consider texture features that are extracted over three different
color spaces: RGB, YCrCb, and HSV. For each color space component, we consider the use of standard gray-scale features that
have been widely applied for texture characterization. Furthermore, we also consider the combination of texture features over
the entire color space. In other words, we consider the use of texture features extracted from all three components of each color
space. A total number of 26 texture features were extracted from
each color component. The list includes: 1) statistical features
(SF) [17], 2) spatial gray-level dependence matrices (SGLDMs)
[18], and 3) gray-level difference statistics (GLDS) [19]. The
following SF texture features were computed: 1) mean, 2) variance, 3) median, 4) energy, 5) skewness, 6) kurtosis, 7) mode,
and 8) entropy. The following SGLDM texture features were
extracted:
1) angular second moment (ASM);
2) contrast;
3) correlation;
4) homogeneity;
5) variance;
6) entropy;
7) sum entropy;
8) sum average;
9) sum variance;
10) difference entropy;
11) difference variance;
12) information measurement of correlation 1;
13) information measurement of correlation 2.
The following GLDS texture features were computed:
1) mean;
2) entropy;
3) contrast;

4) homogeneity;
5) energy.
D. ROI Classification
We investigated the performance of the system using support vector machines (SVMs) and probabilistic neural networks
(PNNs). For both classifiers, we performed training and testing
for differentiating between normal ROIs and abnormal ROIs.
The C-SVM network [20] was investigated using the
Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel and the linear kernel. Significantly better performance was obtained using the
RBF kernel tuned based on the methodology proposed in [20].
More specifically, the values of c = 8 and γ = 0.04 were selected for prescribing the shape of the RBF kernel. These settings
were fine tuned based on numerous runs for different feature sets
using tenfold cross validation for 208 normal and 208 abnormal
ROIs. We also consider the use of a PNN classifier that is based
on the use of RBFs [21]. This classifier was investigated for several spread radii in order to identify the optimal value following
a similar procedure as prescribed for the SVM case.
The leave-one-out method was used for validating all the
classification models unless otherwise stated. The runs were
done for each of the three color systems and for the Y channel.
A total of 4 × 415 runs were carried out for each model, and the
performance of the classifiers was evaluated on the remaining
one subset.
III. RESULTS
Fig. 1 presents a screenshot of the proposed CAD system. An
overview of the hysteroscopic imaging CAD system is demonstrated in Fig. 1(a). The system provides: patient information,
video player, ROI classification into normal or abnormal, and
texture features analysis. Fig. 1(b) presents a screenshot of the
ROI capture mode (manual or semiautomatic) and the analysis
results tab.
A. Texture Feature Analysis
To verify that the feature distributions did not follow a normal
distribution, we used a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test at a significance level of α = 0.05. The test was applied after making the
distribution of each feature to be zero mean and of unit variance
for comparison to an N(0,1) distribution. For all color spaces,
we found that none of the extracted texture features followed a
normal distribution. Thus, in testing for significant differences
between texture features extracted from normal and abnormal
ROIs, we adopt Wilcoxon test, which is nonparametric.
In Table I, we provide the results from statistical tests at different significant levels. At the most basic level (S1), we have
statistical testing at a significance level of α = 0.05. This testing
is commonly used for identifying individual texture feature differences [22]. Given the fact that we are extracting 26 features
per color channel, to account for multiple comparison effects,
we also performed testing at a significance level of α = 0.05/26
(=0.002) using a Bonferroni correction as documented in [23]
(S2 level). To also account for multiple effects within each

The Wilcoxon rank sum test was carried out with “S” and “NS” indicating
significant and nonsignificant difference, respectively at: S1 level α = 0.05,
S2 level α = 0.05/26 (= 0.002), and S3 level α = 0.05/(26 ∗ 3) (=0.0006).
The table summarizes the highest significance level for which we have significant
differences.

color space, we also performed testing at a significance level of
α = 0.05/26 ∗ 3 (=0.0006) (S3 level). In Table I, we report the
highest level for which we detect significant differences between
the normal and abnormal ROIs.
Fig. 3 shows the boxplots of the texture features SF median
and SGLDM variance and contrast for the YCrCb channels for
both the normal and abnormal endometrium ROIs. It is shown
that for the YCrCb channels (see Fig. 3): 1) SF median for
normal ROIs was higher compared to abnormal ROIs for the Y
channel, whereas for the Cr and Cb channels, the abnormal ROIs
gave slightly higher values; 2) SGLDM variance was higher for
the abnormal ROIs for the YCrCb channels; and 3) SGLDM
contrast was also higher for the abnormal ROIs for the YCrCb
channels. These differences were also significantly different for
the YCrCb channels at least for level S1 (see Table I). Additional
features that demonstrated significant difference between normal and abnormal ROIs with the significance difference level
given in parentheses were the following: SF energy (S2) and entropy (S3), SGLDM ASM (S3), homogeneity (S1), and entropy
(S3); and GLDS homogeneity (S1), contrast (S1), energy (S1),
entropy (S1), and mean (S1) (see Table I).
B. CAD Classification Performance
Classifier performance is summarized in Table II (scale =
1 × 1). For each classifier, we investigated the use of SF,
SGLDM, and GLDS features sets extracted from Y, YCrCb,
HSV, and RGB. From the results in Table II, it is clear that
SVM performed better than PNN. In terms of color systems,
YCrCb gave slightly better results, followed by HSV and RGB.

1133

It’s interesting to note that the classification performance of the
Y channel only followed very closely the classification performance of the YCrCb system. For the SVM classifier, the best
performance was achieved with the SF + GLDS features extracted from YCrCb system (%CC = 79%), followed by the SF
+ SGLDM + GLDS that gave %CC = 77% (for both using the
original features sets).
Furthermore, multiscale analysis was carried out to derive
the image feature scale that gives the best classification performance. However, we do not consider the selected scale to be part
of the overall system. More specifically, the YCrCb SF + GLDS
features sets (that gave the highest percentage of correct classifications score) were computed from the images at the following
scales: 2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4, and 9 × 9. SVM and PNN classification models were then developed, and their performance
is tabulated in Table III. It is shown that the best classification
performance was achieved with the feature sets derived at the
1 × 1 image scale (i.e.,%CC = 79% with the SVM classifier),
whereas the feature sets derived at higher image scales (2 × 2
up to 9 × 9) gave models with significantly lower %CC (in the
region of 60% with the SVM classifier).
In order to empirically establish the sufficiency of the number
of training samples, we measured the classification performance
as a function of the size of the training set. Here, we note that
classification error is a nondecreasing function of the number of
training samples (see [22] and [23]). Furthermore, empirically,
as given in [23], increasing the number of training samples beyond what is needed will not result in significant increase in
performance. As documented in Table IV, for our dataset, we
obtained 79% for the original dataset of 416 ROIs that only increased to 81% with the addition of 100 ROIs from the second
dataset (see description in Section II). Furthermore, classification performance was reduced to 76% for 316 ROIs, suggesting
that our dataset size of 416 ROIs should not be reduced further.
The ROC curves of these models are also given in Fig. 4. The
area under the ROC curves was in the region of 0.865–0.870 for
the models with the highest performance (i.e., models 4 and 5
of Table IV).
Furthermore, the models documented in Table IV were also
carried out using tenfold cross validation. The results were
highly comparable but achieving a 1%–2% higher classification scores.
IV. DISCUSSION
In this study, a CAD system was proposed based on color
texture analysis for the analysis of hysteroscopy images of
the endometrium. The system was evaluated on 258 normal
and 258 abnormal ROIs (histopathologically verified) manually extracted by the gynecologist from 52 hysteroscopic imaging examinations (carried out on 52 subjects). It was shown
that the YCrCb, SF + GLDS color texture features could correctly classify 81% of the cases (with a percentage sensitivity
and specificity of 78% and 81%, respectively) based on SVM
modeling. Very similar but slightly lower classification performance was also obtained for the RGB and HSV color systems,
as well as for the Y channel alone. Moreover, image features

analyzed at higher scales gave poorer classification performance. These findings were considered satisfactory by the gynecologist, supporting the differentiation between normal versus
abnormal ROIs that could prove to be very helpful in the early
detection of gynecological cancer.
The results of our study focused on early cancer detection
are worse than the results reported by Vlachokosta et al. [8] for

more advanced cancer cases. Vlachokosta et al. [8] reported a
classification score of 91% that is higher than the 81% achieved
by our method. However, the hysteroscopy cases investigated
by Vlachokosta et al. [8] were clearly identified cases of malignancy that could easily be diagnosed by visualization alone.
The formation of neoangiogenesis and vessels structure in the
image data set that was investigated is considered to be a late

In conclusion, significant research work is still needed in
several directions to enable the deployment of CAD hysteroscopic imaging systems in successful clinical practice. More
specifically, there is a need to: 1) further enhance the proposed
standardized CAD system with radial distortion correction, 2)
investigate the performance of ROI image multiscale feature
analysis like amplitude modulation-frequency modulation (AMFM) features that showed promising results in hysteroscopic
imaging [26] as well as color wavelet features that were used
successfully in endoscopic tumor detection [27], 3) incorporating navigation functionality for suspicious tissue localization
and identification [28], and 4) evaluation on more subjects and
in more clinics.

phenomenon of carcinogenesis. In contrast, in our study, the
effort was targeted at investigating cases at the stage of occult
cancer conditions at the level of initial cellular change to malignancy.
Endoscopy/laparoscopy/hysteroscopy video is widely used
in medical practice during minimally invasive procedures to
navigate in the human organ recognizing local anatomical
landmarks. This task is mastered by the physician following extensive training and clinical practice and requires fine
hand–eye coordination. Although in recent years, the endoscopic equipment manufacturers introduced better camera technologies (high-definition resolution, better three CCD sensors, and new optics and lenses) [14], limitations affecting the
quantitative tissue analysis and computer-aided diagnosis still
exist.
Thus, the proposed CAD system is limited by the limitations
inherent in any endoscopy/laparoscopy/hysteroscopy examination. More specifically, these are the following: 1) the endoscope
distance from the tissue (panoramic versus close-up view), 2)
difference in viewing angles, 3) color correction, and 4) radial
distortion.
It was shown in [5] that for 1) and 2), there was no significant
difference in texture features, whereas for 3) it was shown that
gamma-corrected images gave better image approximations to
the original images. Limitation 4), i.e., radial distortion, is a
serious problem that due to the small size of the endoscopic
lenses used, nonlinear geometric deformations of the image are
caused with points moving radially toward the center [24].
An innovative system to address this problem has recently
been proposed by Melo et al. [25], featuring intrinsic real-time
camera calibration, circular region segmentation, and inference
of relative rotation between the lens probe and the camera head.
