Woo Chul Jeong, Saurav Z. K. Sajib, Hyung Joong Kim, and Oh In Kwon∗

Abstract—Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) is an imaging modality capable of visualizing crosssectional current density and/or conductivity distributions inside
an electrically conducting object. It uses an MRI scanner to measure one component of the magnetic flux density induced by an
externally injected current through a pair of surface electrodes.
For the cases of deep brain stimulation (DBS), electroporation,
and radio frequency (RF) ablation, internal electrodes can be used
to improve the quality of the MREIT images. In this paper, we
propose a new MREIT imaging method using internal electrodes
to visualize a current density distribution within a local region
around them. To evaluate its performance, we conducted and
analyzed a series of numerical simulations and phantom imaging experiments. We compared the reconstructed current density images using the internal electrodes with the obtained using
only the external electrodes. We found that the proposed method
using the internal electrodes stably determines the current density
in the focused region with better accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION
AGNETIC resonance electrical impedance tomography
(MREIT) is a recently developed MR-based impedance
imaging technique to provide cross-sectional images of the conductivity and/or current density distributions inside an electrically conducting imaging object [1]–[15]. When we inject current into the imaging object through a pair of surface electrodes,
it induces an internal distribution of the magnetic flux density
B = (Bx , By , Bz ). Using an MRI scanner with its main magnetic field aligned along the z direction, we can measure the
z-component of B, Bz , in the form of a cross-sectional image.
Since the measured data Bz is determined by the current density distribution and, therefore, by the conductivity distribution,

conductivity image reconstructions from the measured data are
possible in MREIT. Recent studies of in vivo animal and human
imaging experiments have showed successful reconstructions of
cross-sectional conductivity images [16]–[18].
However, the measured Bz data is contaminated with noise
and the noise level is inversely proportional to the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) of the MR magnitude image and the duration
of current injection. Using a constant current source and thin
carbon-hydrogel surface electrodes with a large contact area,
we have injected current synchronized with an MR pulse sequence [22]–[24]. One may adopt a pulse sequence such as the
multiecho injection current nonlinear encoding (ME–ICNE) to
minimize the noise level in the measured Bz data [19]–[24]. For
a given amount of current amplitude, the quality of reconstructed
images depends primarily on the noise level in the Bz data.
The visualization of current density in the whole imaging region from the measured Bz by the externally injected current has
been studied in Oh et al. [30]. Recently, the projected current
density JP as the best approximation of the internal current
density J from the measured Bz data was proposed by solving
a two-dimensional Poisson’s equation with the Dirichlet condition determined by the relationship between the induced internal
current density and the measured Bz data [31].
When we inject current through a pair of surface electrodes,
it spreads all over the imaging object to produce a threedimensional distribution of the internal current density. This
usually results in a poor SNR of the recovered conductivity
and/or current density images due to weak Bz signals inside
the imaging area. Since the quality of the measured Bz data
depends on the MR magnitude image SNR and the duration of
injection current, the measured Bz data becomes very noisy in
the local region where MR signal void occurs. To compute the
projected current density JP , it is required to solve Poisson’s
equation with the Laplacian of the noisy Bz data as its source
term. Therefore, excessive amount of noise in a defective region
may affect other regions through the noise propagation process.
For diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes, electrodes
can be inserted into the human body. For example, in electrical
impedance tomography (EIT), a probe with multiple electrodes
has been developed to inject currents and measure voltages inside the body for endo-tomography of an internal region of
interest (ROI) [25]. In radio frequency (RF) ablation, an alternating current of several hundreds of kHz is delivered through
an internal electrode to heat a target tissue [26]. Deep brain
stimulation (DBS) electrodes are intended to stimulate specific areas of the brain to treat movement disorders including

essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease [27], [28]. One may
also use an internal electrode to apply a high electric field for
electroporation to deliver pharmaceutical agents and drugs directly into cells [29]. If such an internal electrode is available,
we may use it as well to inject current for MREIT imaging.
Then, the Bz signal in a local region near the internal electrode
becomes stronger since it is highly dependent on the current
density at the same position.
In this paper, we focus on the recovery of the internal current
density J in the ROI around the internal electrode using the
enhanced Bz data. We propose a new method to recover the
focused current density JF in a local region around the internal
electrode. Using numerical simulation results, we validate the
proposed algorithm to stably determine the current density in
the ROI. We compare the reconstructed internal current densities with and without the use of the internal electrode. To verify
the proposed method in a real experiment, we design a conductivity phantom and perform imaging experiments using an
internal electrode at the center of the phantom. The Results of
the phantom imaging experiments reflect the advantage of the
proposed method over conventional methods to recover a focused current density JF in a local region around the internal
electrode.

A. Magnetic Flux Density Measurement
Let Ω be an electrically conducting cylindrical object with
its boundary ∂Ω. Let Ω ⊂ Ω,  = 1, . . . , Ns , denotes the th
imaging slice of the cylindrical object Ω, where Ns is the number
of imaging slices. The multiecho spin echo pulse sequence for
MREIT receives NE multiple echoes by using a series of 180◦
RF pulses to obtain a train of echo signals at the echo times
TE  ,  = 1, . . . , NE . The th measured k-space data by injecting
currents I ± can be expressed as

where ρ is the th MR magnitude image, δ is the th systematic phase artifacts, γ = 26.75 × 107 rad/T · s is the gyromagnetic ratio of hydrogen, and Tc is the current pulse width
for  = 1, . . . , NE . The systematic phase artifacts are caused
by a variety of factors such as the phase shift due to the main
field inhomogeneity, the mismatch between the center of the
data acquisition interval, RF pulse timing instabilities, additional gradient field, etc. The th MR magnitude image ρ can
be precisely described as
ρ (x, y) = M⊥ (0+ )e−T E  /T 2
where M⊥ (0+ ) is the transverse magnetization after the RF
pulse, T2 is the transverse relaxation time, and e−T E  /T 2 denotes
the exponential decay at the echo time TE  [32].

The MREIT technique utilizes the relation between the measured Bz data and the current density J based on Ampere’s
law:
1
∇ × B(r)
(6)
J(r) =
μ0
where μ0 = 4π × 10−7 Tm/A is the magnetic permeability of
free space. The quality of the measured Bz data is poor in a
defective region, where the MR signal intensity is small or the
duration of injection current is short as expressed in (4). In
animal and human imaging experiments, this usually occurs in
air-filled organs and the outer layers of bones. To recover the
internal current density from the measured Bz data, we use the
Biot–Savart law given by

(y − y  )Jx (r ) − (x − x )Jy (r ) 
μ0
Bz (r) =

+ BzI (r),

r = (x, y, z) ∈ Ω

where BzI is the magnetic flux density due to the current I along
the external wires.
When we inject current through an internal electrode, there
occurs a relatively high intensity of the current density in the
local ROI R near the electrode. To recover the current density
in R ⊂ Ω, we define a vector JF as

The projected current density JP , which is the best approximation of the current density J from the measured Bz data, can be
expressed as an exact form [31]:

In the vector space V = {J = (Jx , Jy , Jz )|∇ · J(r) = 0, r ∈

V, which satisfies (∇ × JP ) · (0, 0, 1) = − μ10 ∇2 Bz in Ω and
JP · n = J · n on ∂Ω [31], where n denotes the unit outward
normal vector on ∂Ω .
The difference JD between the projected current density JP

estimated JF has certain advantages. The estimated JF can be

the computation of JP requires a numerical solution of the
Poisson’s equation in the whole imaging region Ω with the
Laplacian of Bz as a source term, the calculated JF provides
a recoverable current component in the chosen ROI, R ⊂ Ω ,
without being affected by the noise propagation from a defective

We built a cylindrical model with a diameter of 110 mm
and height of 140 mm using COMSOL (COMSOL Inc. USA)
as shown in Fig. 1. We attached four electrodes around the
middle surface of the model and placed one internal electrode at
the center. Inside the model, we placed a cylindrical insulating
barrier of 0.0001 Sm−1 and a conductive anomaly of 1.5 Sm−1 .
The background saline had a conductivity of 1.0 Sm−1 .
Figs. 1(a) and (b) show the model and its finite element mesh,
respectively. The mesh consists of 990854 tetrahedral elements
and 85 938 triangular elements on its surface. We solved the

∂F1 and ∂F02 which was a part of the internal electrode as
shown in Fig. 1(e). In contrast, the conventional external current

D. Phantom Experiment
We conducted a cylindrical acrylic phantom with a height
of 140 mm and diameter of 110 mm to verify the proposed
method in a real imaging experiment. An open-ended cylindrical insulating thin shell with 2-mm thickness was placed inside
the phantom to create an obstacle to disturb the internal current flow. An anomaly with a diameter of 30 mm, made of agar
gel (800 ml distilled water, 8 g NaCl, 1 g CuSO4 , and 15 g
Agar), was also placed inside the phantom. The conductivity of
the agar object was 1.5 Sm−1 . We placed an acrylic rod with a
height of 140 mm and diameter of 10 mm at the center of the
phantom. We constructed an internal electrode by wrapping the
middle part of the rod with a sheet of carbon (HUREV Co. Ltd.,

saline (2 L of distilled water, 2 g CuSO4 , 7 g NaCl). Figs. 3(a–c)
show the phantom design; (a) shows the positions of the agar object, the open-ended thin shell object, and the internal electrode,
(b) depicts the internal electrode, and (c) shows the phantom
inside the RF coil.
We performed the imaging experiment using a 3 T MRI
scanner (Philips Achieva 3.0 T) with a multi-channel RF coil
(Philips, SENSE-Head-8ch). We collected two sets of k-space
data by injecting currents; external injection current between
the pair of surface electrodes from ∂F1 to ∂F1 and internal
injection current from ∂F1 to the internal electrode ∂F02 . Using
a custom-designed MREIT current source [23] synchronized
with the ICNE multispin-echo pulse sequence [19], we injected
a 5 mA current as shown in Fig. 3(d). The imaging parameters
were as follows: repetition time (TR ) = 1500 ms, echo time
(TE  ) = 15 ×  ms, echo space (Es ) = 15 ms, slice thickness =
5 mm, number of echoes (NE ) = 8, field-of-view = 180 ×
180 mm2 , imaging matrix = 128 × 128, number of excitation
(NEX) = 10, and imaging time = 32 min.
Fig. 4 shows the MR magnitude and the acquired Bz images
by the external and internal injection currents. To obtain the Bz
data, we combined multiple values of Bz  for  = 1, . . . , 8 by
estimating the weighting factors ω in (5) to reduce the noise
level of Bz .
III. RESULTS

In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method,
we assumed that the measured Bz data included white Gaussian

The level of the background region SNR was fixed at 100,
75, and 50 dB for three trials and the SNR at the target region
of anomaly was set to two times higher than the level of the
background noise. To generate a defective region, we added
severe noise to the thin open-ended insulating shell.
Fig. 5 shows the x and y components of the recovered current density JF obtained using (8). Due to the presence of the
cylindrical insulating obstacle, most of the internal current was
shunted around the ROI R [see Fig. 5(a)] for the case of external
injection current. Since the estimated JF did not lead to propagation of noise effects to the surrounding region, the severe
noise in the insulating shell did not affect the estimated current
density JF in the region R. For the external injection current
case with increased noise levels, the recovered current density
was almost indistinguishable in R due to the relatively weak
signal of Bz as shown in Fig. 5(a). However, for the internal
electrode case the recovered current density JF in R was not
affected by the noise in the insulating shell, and it provided a
sufficient resolution to distinguish the anomaly.
We calculated the relative L2 -error to compare the simulated
noiseless current density J and the estimated current density JF
in the region R. The relative L2 -error was defined by

For the background current density, we first solved the threedimensional harmonic equation assuming a background conductivity of σ0 = 1 Sm−1 . The upper and lower rows in Fig. 6

we note that the use of the internal electrode produced concentrated current flows in the anomaly region R whereas externally

Due to the concentration of the current density in the ROI R, the
enhanced current density in Fig. 8(f) using the internal electrode
provided a clear contrast compared to the recovered current density using the external electrodes as shown in Fig. 8(c).
IV. DISCUSSION
From the measured magnetic flux density Bz data, the projected current density JP = J0 + J∗ in (10) is the best approximation of the current density by injecting current, which reflects
the measured Bz and the injected current simultaneously. When
the current is transversely injected into a cylindrical imaging object, the recovered projected current density JP stably approximates the true current density J depending on the z component
of J − J0 .
Unlike the conventional external electrode case, the current
density J using the internal electrode was highly concentrated
and rapidly changed around the internal electrode. The recovered current density JF in (8) instead of JP , which reduces noise
propagation from defective regions to their surrounding regions,
may include a relatively large difference compared to the JP
corresponding to the transversally injected current through the
external electrode.
The recovered current density JF in the local region R ⊂ Ω
in (8) can be applicable to any size of region and it can be used
instead of JP by solving (11). In this paper, we focused on the
recovery of current density in a local region around the internal
electrode. If there is no defective area in the imaging region, the
projected current density JP = J0 + J∗ can remove side artifacts BzI in (7) by the external lead wires because the harmonic
term ∇2 Bz cancels the effect of BzI by taking ∇2 BzI (r) = 0 in
the imaging region [39].
Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography
(MREPT) is a technique that uses MR to derive noninvasive information of tissue properties including electrical conductivity and permittivity based on the B1 mapping technique without applying external current. MREIT and MREPT
are electromagnetic tissue property mapping techniques that
provide the electrical conductivity distribution of the human
body at different frequency ranges. MREIT provides conductivity images in the low frequency range below 1 kHz, while
MREPT provides conductivity images at the Larmor frequency.
Since biological tissues exhibit frequency-dependent conductivity spectra, their values at different frequencies may provide
valuable diagnostic information.
To apply the MREIT technique to the recovery of current density in a local region, we focused on developing a local imaging
technique. A typical MR imaging region in MREIT contains
defective regions wherein the quality of Bz is very poor due

to low proton density and short transverse relaxation time. The
noisy Bz data in the defective regions may severely degrade the
reconstructed conductivity distribution in the whole imaging
region. The current density imaging technique we have developed in a local region can avoid defective regions and visualize
the internal conductivity within the local region around the internal electrode. The method enables the minimization of both
the injection current and the imaging time while retaining or
improving the image quality. Electrical stimulation techniques
such as RF ablation, deep brain stimulation, electroporation,
and endo-electrode usage in EIT for the treatment of various
diseases utilize the internal electrode to enhance their clinical
outcomes [25]–[29]. The internal current density distribution is
influenced by several factors such as the shape and position of
the internal electrode, imaging area, and conductivity distribution around the internal electrode. As a clinical application of
the MREIT technique by optimizing the measured magnetic flux
density signal using the internal electrode, each case requires
appropriate approached considering its clinical situation.
The proton resonance frequency (PRF) method is used to
monitor RF ablation by detecting a temperature shift in the
frequency. The method measures the temperature variation in
tissues by subtracting the phase distributions before and after a
temperature change [35]–[38]. In general, the PRF method typically uses spoiled gradient echo MR pulse sequences. Therefore,
it suffers from magnetic field inhomogeneity artifacts, thereby
resulting in inaccurate temperature imaging. Since there exists an approximatively linear relationship between tissue conductivity and temperature, the MREIT technique using the internal electrode can be utilized to measure the temperature
variation by measuring the magnetic flux density Bz data by
canceling out the background field inhomogeneity through interleaved acquisitions. The proposed method has the potential
to visualize the internal current density and/or conductivity
distribution corresponding to the temperature variation during
RF ablation.
As a restorative functional neurosurgical technique, DBS
electrodes are implanted in what are assumed to be optimal
sites inside the brain and the stimulator is turned on to stimulate areas near the targeted brain region. The MREIT technique,
providing a continuous monitoring system showing the current
density generated by DBS, can potentially be used to optimize
the current density by changing the configuration of the active
DBS contacts.
Since the SNR of the measured magnetic flux density is inversely proportional to the intensity of MR magnitude and the
duration of injected current, by combining the maximized duration of injection current using the ICNE-multiecho, we plan to
develop an MR pulse sequence to maximize the quality of Bz
in a local ROI and in dynamic MREIT imaging.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we suggested a new method to visualize the
internal current density within a local region around the internal electrode in MREIT imaging. The conventional MREIT

JEONG et al.: FOCUSED CURRENT DENSITY IMAGING USING INTERNAL ELECTRODE IN MREIT

technique suffers from poor SNR of the recovered conductivity and/or current density due to weak Bz signal by externally
injected current. In combination with the use of the internal
electrode, the MREIT technique can be applied to conventional
clinical devices using the internal electrode and provide useful
information regarding the electrical properties in a local region
by enhancing the magnetic flux density. Results from numerical
simulations and phantom imaging experiments demonstrated
the feasibility of the proposed algorithm that stably determined
and enhanced the current density in the local region. To test
the proposed method, the reconstructed internal current density
was compared to that obtained from the conventional method
through a saline agar-gel phantom experiment.
