for Human MR Imaging at Ultrahigh Fields
Xinqiang Yan, Jan Ole Pedersen, Long Wei, Xiaoliang Zhang* , and Rong Xue∗

Abstract—Objective: In microstrip transmission line (MTL)
transmit/receive (transceive) arrays used for ultrahigh field MRI,
the array length is often constrained by the required resonant frequency, limiting the image coverage. The purpose of this study is to
increase the imaging coverage and also improve its parallel imaging
capability by utilizing a double-row design. Methods: A 16-channel
double-row MTL transceive array was designed, constructed, and
tested for human head imaging at 7 T. Array elements between two
rows were decoupled by using the induced current elimination or
magnetic wall decoupling technique. In vivo human head images
were acquired, and g-factor results were calculated to evaluate
the performance of this double-row array. Results: Testing results
showed that all coil elements were well decoupled with a better
than –18 dB transmission coefficient between any two elements.
The double-row array improves the imaging quality of the lower
portion of the human head, and has low g-factors even at high acceleration rates. Conclusion: Compared with a regular single-row
MTL array, the double-row array demonstrated a larger imaging coverage along the z-direction with improved parallel imaging
capability. Significance: The proposed technique is particularly
suitable for the design of large-sized transceive arrays with large
channel counts, which ultimately benefits the imaging performance
in human MRI.

LTRAHIGH field (i.e., 7 T and higher) MRI, could provide
a higher signal-to-noise ratio, an improved susceptibility
contrast and a greater spectral dispersion [1]–[5]. At the frequency of 300 MHz (Larmor frequency of proton at 7 T) or
higher, it is technically challenging to design large-sized head
coil [6]–[10] as the wavelength in biological tissue is significant
shortened [11]–[13]. Transmit/receive (transceive) arrays have
proved to be a popular choice for radio frequency (RF) coil design at ultrahigh fields [14]–[20], providing the capability of RF
shimming, parallel transmission (pTx) [21]–[23], and parallel
imaging [24]–[27].
Transceive arrays using the microstrip transmission line
(MTL) technology have been advocated for ultrahigh field
MRI due to the improved resonance stability, reduced radiation losses, and a simple structure [7]–[10], [16], [28]–[37].
However, the image coverage along the coil axis (z-direction) is
limited because of the length constrains of regular open-ended
MTL resonators at ultrahigh fields, and the reduced B1 field near
the ends of the resonators [8], [38], making usable B1 along
the z-direction often inadequate to cover entire human head.
This problem could be addressed by using multiple-row MTL
transceive arrays, which are able to provide enough longitudinal coverage by using regular or even shorter MTL elements.
With independent transmit elements from different rows, the
multiple-row MTL transceive array could offer the possibility
of RF shimming and pTx along the z-direction. The multiplerow design could also improve the parallel imaging performance
due to the enlarged number of independent receive elements.
The main challenge in designing multiple-row MTL array is
to attain sufficient electromagnetic (EM) decoupling among coil
elements from adjacent rows. To ensure enough coverage along
the z-direction, coil elements from adjacent rows are usually
tightly placed, resulting in strongly EM coupling. Although L/C
decoupling networks [28], [30], [31], [39] have been proposed
and shown superior decoupling capability for adjacent elements
from the same row, it may not be readily feasible for addressing
the strong coupling between elements from adjacent rows.
In this study, we designed and constructed a 16-channel
double-row MTL transceive array for human head MR imaging
at 7 T. A novel decoupling technique based on the induced current compensation (ICE) or a magnetic wall decoupling method
[40]–[45] was employed to reduce the coupling between adjacent rows. To investigate the decoupling performance, transmission coefficient (S21 ) plots and MR images of two-channel
double-row MTL arrays with and without the proposed decoupling method were measured and compared. Bench tests and
in vivo MR images of the 16-channel dual-row MTL array
were obtained to demonstrate its feasibility and performance in

ultrahigh field MRI. Sagittal human head images and g-factors of
the double-row array were compared with those of a single-row
array to evaluate the benefits offered by the double-row design.
The multiple-row design has been applied for traditional L/C
loop arrays [18], [46]; however, no multiple-row MTL array has
been reported to our knowledge.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Two-Channel Double-Row MTL Array
In previous works, ICE decoupling has been successfully
applied for MTL resonators [40]–[42], L/C loops [43], and
monopole antennas [45] to reduce the coupling between adjacent coil elements. In the literature [42], the mutual coupling
between the coil element and decoupling element (X cd ) has to
satisfy a condition to achieve good decoupling performance. The
space between two MTL resonators from adjacent rows is very
limited and, thus, the decoupling element was placed closely
next to the coil elements rather than inserted between them.
Each element in the two-channel double-row MTL array was
manufactured from a Teflon bar of 9 cm × 4 cm × 1.5 cm,
as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The distance between the two
elements was 1 cm, and the total length of the double-row MTL
array was 19 cm. By using the double row or triple row design
with Teflon substrate, the coil length or imaging coverage along
the z-direction can reach 60 cm, given a maximum length of
∼36 cm for a first harmonic microstrip. The ground was made
from adhesive-backed copper foil with a width of 4.5 cm. The
strip conductors were made of 10 mm-wide copper tapes. For
each MTL element, a trimmer capacitor Ct1 was terminated
at the feed end for tuning and a fixed capacitor Ct2 (33pF,
ATC Corp, Huntington Station, NY, USA) was terminated at the
other end. To avoid the condition that the value of the matching
capacitor was too small, a 1.5-pF fixed capacitor and a trimmer
capacitor Cm connected in shunt were used for matching [47].
A resonator with two capacitors (Cd1 and Cd2) terminated at
both ends and one variable capacitor (Cdt) terminated at the
center was applied as the decoupling element.
The reflection coefficient (S11 ) and transmission coefficient
(S21 ) of the two elements with and without the decoupling
element were performed using an Agilent E5071C network

analyzer. To assure the performance of the proposed decoupling
method, a pattern comparison of MR images on a cylindrical water phantom acquired with: 1) a single-coil element without the
other element; 2) one coil element of the coupled two-channel array; and 3) one coil element of the well-decoupled two-channel
array; was performed using a gradient recalled echo (GRE) sequence with identical parameters. The parameters of the GRE
sequence used were flip angle (FA) = 25°, TR = 100 ms, TE
= 10 ms, field of view (FOV) = 210 × 210 mm2 , matrix =
256 × 256, slice thickness = 3 mm, bandwidth = 320 Hz/pixel.
During the experiments, the cylindrical water phantom (length
37 cm, diameter 16 cm) was placed 3 cm below the coil arrays.
The EM parameters of the water phantom were measured by a
dielectric probe (DAK-12, SPEAG, Switzerland): conductivity
σ = 0.59 S/m; relative permittivity εr = 78.
B. 16-Channel Double-Row Array for Human Head Imaging
The 16-channel double-row human head array consists of
eight two-channel blocks as described above. All coil elements
were mounted on an acrylic former with an outer diameter of
25 cm. Fig. 2(a) shows the constructed coil array and Fig. 2(b)
presents the element numbering.
MTL resonators have demonstrated better decoupling performance over L/C loop resonators owing to their confined EM
field. Therefore, no extra decoupling method was employed for
coil elements from the same row in this study. All coil elements
were matched to 50 Ω and tuned to 297.2 MHz, which was the
Larmor frequency of the unitized 7-T MRI system. Shielded
cable traps were employed to avoid possible “cable resonance.”
The scattering (S-) parameter matrix of the 16-channel array
loaded with a human head was measured with the network analyzer. When any two elements were measured, all other coil
elements were terminated with 50-Ω loads. The S11 plots were
also used to calculate Q values. Our RF interface can only operate eight channels, with an eight-way power splitter, eight
transmit/receive, switches and eight 50-Ω preamplifiers. To test
this 16-channel array, scans were conducted two times. The size
of the human head used in this study is about 16 cm in diameter,
while the diameter of the coil achieves 25 cm. Phase adjustment is not required when the dimension of the coil array is
large compared with the sample size [34]. Therefore, the phase

1654

increment between adjacent channels was set with 45° during
each scan. Meanwhile, the unused channels were terminated
with 50-Ω loads to eliminate unwanted RF power reflection.
During the two scans, the positioning of a subject was carefully
kept unchanged via the line markers made on the patient table.
GRE images on a healthy human head were obtained using
the 16-channel dual-row array coil. The sequence parameters
were set as follows: FA = 25°, TR = 100 ms, TE = 10 ms, FOV
= 210 × 210 mm2 , matrix = 256 × 256, slice thickness = 5 mm,
number of excitation (NEX) = 1, bandwidth = 320 Hz/pixel.
To further evaluate the improved imaging coverage for human
head, the obtained sagittal image was also compared with that
of a regular single-row eight-channel array coil.
Accelerated GRE images with the reduction factor (R) of 2,
3, and 4 were acquired and analyzed to investigate the parallel imaging capability of the 16-channel array structure. The
double-row array had a larger number of receive elements, and
should have better parallel imaging performance over the regular single-row array. To validate this assumption, g-factor results
with accelerations in the anterior–posterior (AP) direction of
the 16-channel and eight-channel arrays were measured, calculated, and compared. All MRI experiments were performed on a
whole-body MRI scanner (7T MAGNETOM, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). The human MRI experimental protocol was approved by the local Institutional Review Board, and
the volunteers signed an informed consent form before MRI
experiments. Before human head MR imaging, we performed
safety test by measuring the temperature of a piece of 7-kg
pork for an hour using the same GRE sequence. The measurement was conducted with an Opsens fiber optic thermometer
(Quebec, Canada). We placed four fiber optic sensors separately
at shallow and deep regions of the pork meat, and changed the
positions for repeated measurements after half hour. The temperature stayed between 21.1° and 21.2° at all selected points,
and no “local hot spots” were observed during experiments.

resonators from adjacent rows could be achieved by using the ICE decoupling
method.

III. RESULTS
A. Bench Test Results and Phantom Images of the
Two-channel Double-Row Array
Fig. 3(a) and (b) shows the S11 and S21 plots of the two
MTL elements without decoupling treatments. It is clear that the
two elements were strongly coupled (S21 = −7.9 dB) and the
resonant peak was obviously split. By using the ICE decoupling
method, the isolation was improved to –25.3 dB and no resonant
peak splitting was observed (see Fig. 3(c) and (d), indicating
the sufficient decoupling capability of the proposed decoupling
method.
Fig. 4 shows the water phantom images acquired from
(a) individual elements, (b) elements from the coupled array,
and (c) elements from the ICE-decoupled array. Part of the MR
signals was obviously transferred to the other coil element when
no decoupling treatments were used, as shown in Fig. 4(b),
whereas the MR images from the ICE-decoupled array [see
Fig. 4(c)] showed great similarity with the images from individual elements [see Fig. 4(a)]. This indicated that the proposed
decoupling method could effectively reduce the strong coupling

the images from the individual elements, indicating the excellent decoupling
performance.

results shown above.

matched to 50 Ω. With the proposed ICE decoupling method,
the isolation between two adjacent elements from different rows
was better than –20 dB. As expected, the isolation among any
two elements of the same row was better than –19 dB even
that no extra decoupling treatments were employed. The worst
case and average isolation among any two elements of the
16-channel array were –18.1 and –26.7 Db, respectively. The
noise covariance results [see Fig. 5(b)] was in agreement with
the S-parameter results. Given that MR experiments were conducted using the two rows separately (each row one time), the
covariance between elements from different rows was almost 0.
The unloaded Q of each coil element was approximately 221.
The Q value loaded with the human head varied from 92 to 134
due to the different element-sample distance.

C. Transmit Field Profiles, Human Head Images, and Parallel
Imaging Performance
Fig. 6(a) shows the transmit field (B1+ ) maps in the transverse (upper panel) and sagittal (lower panel) planes obtained
from each row of the double-row array. The B1+ maps were
calculated by a double-angle method [48] and scaled to angle.
Experimental parameters are TR/TE = 1s/10 ms, FA = 10°
and 20°, FOV = 210 × 210 mm2 , matrix = 128 × 128 mm2 ,
slice thickness = 5 mm, bandwidth = 320 Hz. Each row of the
double-row array is a standard MTL coil array and demonstrates
a typical MTL array property. For the standard single-row MTL
arrays, their B1+ map of each channel at 7 T has been reported
in [16]. The coil sensitivity profiles of individual element of the
proposed double-row MTL array were acquired and presented
in Fig. 6(b). As expected, the two rows have different B1+ and
coil sensitivity profiles, which might be advantageous for B1
shimming and the pTx technology.
Fig. 7(a) and (b) shows the combined sagittal GRE images
obtained using the proposed 16-channel double-row array and
a regular eight-channel single-row array, respectively. The two
arrays have the same length and the sequence parameters for MR
imaging are exactly the same. The data of individual elements
were combined with the sum of squares (SOS) method and
without intensity correction. The double-row array, compared
with the regular array, promises a larger imaging coverage, and

head, as shown in the red boxes of Fig. 7(a) and (b).
Fig. 8 shows a set of axial GRE images obtained by using
each row of the 16-channel array and their combination. It is
clear that the signal sensitivity of the first row is high in the
upper area of the human head, while very weak at the lower
area, e.g., cerebellum, brainstem, and upper spinal cord. With
the help of the second row, 16-channel double-row array has
the imaging capability of the whole human head. Concluded

acceleration), 2, 3, and 4, respectively are shown in Fig. 10. The
accelerated images were reconstructed with generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions (GRAPPA) using the
PULSAR toolbox [49]. In the reconstruction, 18 autocalibration
signal (ACS) lines were used for each reduced rate. The image
quality is still acceptable when the reduction factor achieves 4.
To further present the improved parallel performance of the
double-row design, the average, and maximum g-factors in the
sagittal plane using the 16-channel array were measured, calculated, and compared with those from a regular eight-channel
array. These average and maximum g-factors with R varying
from 2 to 8 are listed in Table I and plotted in Fig. 11(a) and (b).
G-factor maps of the two arrays with R of 2, 3, 4, and 5 were
also shown in Fig. 11(c). Based on these results, the proposed
double-row design, compared with the regular single-row array,
improved the g-factors and, thus, parallel imaging performance
in the AP direction, even that both arrays have the same number of coil elements in this direction. Considering that there
are two elements arranged in the z-direction, the double-row
design should also be capable of performing acceleration longitudinally, which is almost impossible for a single-row design.
G-factors were calculated using an RF coil array design and
analysis software Musaik (Speag, Switzerland).

from the sensitivity profile of each coil element, these axial
images have a higher signal sensitivity at peripheral regions and
a relatively lower sensitivity in the central area.
Individual images in the transverse and sagittal planes from
each coil element and their combination with the SOS method
are shown in Fig. 9(a) and (b). These images were reconstructed from raw data and without any postprocessing treatment. Each coil element has a diverse and independent sensitivity map, which is beneficial to enhancing the parallel imaging
performance.
To evaluate the parallel imaging performance, sagittal images
using the 16-channel array with the reduction rate R of 1 (no

In this study, a MTL transceive array using multiple-row
design technique is proposed for ultrahigh field MRI. This technique has been successfully implemented by designing and testing a 16-channel double-row transceive array for human head
imaging at 7 T. To reduce the coupling between elements of
adjacent rows, a novel decoupling method based on the ICE
decoupling method was employed. Given the limited space between elements from adjacent rows, the decoupling element
was placed closely next to the coil elements, instead of between
them. This decoupling method has shown superior decoupling
capability, improving the isolation of the two rows from –7.9 dB
(without decoupling treatments) to better than –18 dB.
A main challenge when designing large-sized RF coils at
ultrahigh fields is the increased inductance which decreases the
resonant frequency. With the proposed multiple-row design, a
large imaging coverage was obtained meanwhile the length of
each element was significantly shortened. The regular MTL
resonator used in RF coil designs is a first harmonic resonator. Its
length for resonating at 300 MHz, the proton Larmor frequency
at 7 T, is approximately 36 cm when using Teflon as the dielectric
substrate. By using the double-row design, the array length could
extend to more than 60 cm, which is sufficiently long for most
MR applications in humans.
The double-row array has also shown better parallel imaging
performance over the regular single-row array because the number of independent receiver elements was doubled. By using the
proposed double-row technique, the average g-factor of sagittal
human head images was improved from 1.41 to 1.06 at the acceleration rate of 4. The parallel imaging performance could be
further improved by increasing the number of rows. In addition,
the multichannel multiple-row design provides the capability of

Calculation was based on sagittal human head images. Both the maximum and average g-factors were
significantly improved, indicating that the double-row array promises better parallel imaging performance
over the single-row array.

performing RF shimming and pTx along the z-direction besides
the x- and y- directions. Thus it is advantageous in providing
more homogeneous transmit field in the human head. By changing the capacitance distribution of coil elements from different
rows, different transmit fields and receive sensitivity fields could
be obtained [50]. Although in this study, the MTL array with
only two rows was tested, the number of rows could extend to
three or even more. The double-row MTL array presented here
is easy to fabricate in practice, and very suitable for designing

large-sized parallel arrays with large channel counts at ultrahigh
fields.
V. CONCLUSION
In summary, we proposed a multiple-row transmission line
transceive array design for human MR imaging in this study.
Its feasibility has been validated through bench tests and in
vivo MRI experiments at the ultrahigh field of 7 T. The EM

isolation among any two elements achieved –18 dB or better by using the ICE/magnetic wall decoupling method. Compared to the regular single-row MTL array, the double-row array provided larger imaging coverage along the z-direction and
better parallel imaging performance, being able to image the
whole human brain including the cerebrum, cerebellum, and
brainstem.
