Abstract—Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphism
has been shown to be important in hypertension progression and
also in diabetes complications, especially associated with heart disease. Heart rate variability (HRV) is an established measure for
classification of autonomic function regulating heart rate, based
on the interbeat interval time series derived from a raw ECG
recording. Results of this paper show that the length (number of
interbeat intervals) and preprocessing of the tachogram affect the
HRV analysis outcome. The comparison was based on tachogram
lengths of 250, 300, 350, and 400 RR-intervals and five preprocessing approaches. An automated adaptive preprocessing method
for the heart rate biosignal and tachogram length of 400 interbeat
intervals provided the best classification. HRV results differed for
the Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) group between the I/I genotype and the I/D and D/D genotypes, whereas for controls there
was no significant difference in HRV between genotypes. Selecting
an appropriate length of recording and automated preprocessing
has confirmed that there is an effect of ACE polymorphism including the I/I genotype and that I/I should not be combined with I/D
genotype in determining the extent of autonomic modulation of the
heart rate.
Index Terms—Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphism, genotypes, heart rate variability analysis, preprocessing,

I. INTRODUCTION
NGINEERING solutions are becoming ubiquitous in
health care provision addressing screening, diagnostics,
and treatment. For mobile and wearable devices to function optimally, information received from these biosensors needs to be
accurate and clinically meaningful in order to achieve improved
healthcare. Pervasive biosignal recording and interpretation relies on signals being recorded on a continuous or intermittent
basis requiring classification algorithms to deal with different
length signals and preprocessing for removal of noise from the
signal. ECG signals are no exception. Raw ECG signals for
heart rate analysis are often resampled, corrected for baseline
wander and respiration artifact before the fiducial point of the
QRS interval is identified and the interbeat intervals determined
[1], [2].
Heart rate variability (HRV) describes fluctuations of the
interbeat intervals between normal heartbeats and provides
information about cardiac autonomic modulation, where the
parasympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system
(ANS) leads to an increase and the sympathetic component to
a decrease in the interbeat intervals [3]–[6]. Usually, higher
HRV reflects better autonomic modulation of the heart rate with
parasympathetic dominance [3]. However, decreased as well as
increased HRV has been found to be a risk factor for cardiac
arrhythmia and a significant feature of morbidity and mortality [7]–[9]. Overall, HRV can be used as a noninvasive marker
for detection of various pathological conditions from wearable
biosensors.
HRV also facilitates the detection of autonomic neuropathy
[10]–[13], as the incidence of autonomic neuropathy increases
with duration of diabetes. Application of HRV for assessing
cardiac function in diabetic patients helps to assess risk of adverse cardiac events and prevent further complications such as
ventricular arrhythmia, silent ischaemia, sudden cardiac death,
and stroke by timely individualized treatment.
However, in addition to autonomic neuropathy, age, gender [14], and genetic factors can also influence HRV by up to
50% of the inherent variation [15], [16]. These factors possibly
complicate or limit the detection of diabetes-related conditions
and cardiac dysfunction. One of these gene polymorphisms, is
the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphism corresponding to insertion (I) or deletion (D) of a 287-base pair
sequence of DNA in intron 16 of the ACE gene (rs4340) [17].

As shown in the literature, ACE I/D polymorphism affects circulating ACE levels and I/I, I/D, and D/D are associated with
low, intermediate, and high levels of ACE, respectively [18],
[19]. The relationship between the ACE I/D polymorphism and
cardiovascular risk has been reported [20]–[25]. However, this
polymorphism has only been addressed in a small number of
studies [26]–[30].
Busjahn et al. analyzed the effect of ACE polymorphism on
HRV in twins (67% monozygotic, 33% dizygotic) and demonstrated that time- and frequency-domain features of HRV were
significantly influenced by genetic variability [26]. This result was obtained from the analysis of HRV features across
the groups with ACE D/D genotype and combined I/I and I/D
types (I/D + I/I). In a clinical study, Steeds et al. found no significant effect of ACE genotypes on time- or spectral-domain
HRV features after myocardial infarction [27]. Different from
the previous research by Busjahn et al., this study compared
HRV parameters across three groups of ACE I/I, I/D, and D/D.
Combining I/I and I/D for determining genotype effect on HRV
in clinical populations was also reported in [29] and [31]. All
studies, however, used manual preprocessing methods and did
not control for recording length. The effect of ACE polymorphism has also been investigated in diabetes, where the ACE I/D
polymorphism was shown to be associated with Type 2 Diabetes
Mellitus (T2DM) [32], [33] and HRV features were significantly
different in diabetic patients compared to nondiabetic patients
[12].
Considering the aforementioned ambiguous results of ACE
classification and its role in HRV features in the literature, we
investigated how ACE polymorphism and diabetes interact to
affect the classification results with respect to different lengths
recordings and preprocessing methods. The aim of preprocessing is to remove arrhythmic events and artifacts, which do not
originate from sinus node rhythm, i.e., the nonsinus intervals.
Manual preprocessing is used in most cases, but it is time consuming, difficult to reproduce and subject to inter- and intraoperator variations. Therefore, diverse automated methods have
been proposed but have yet to be standardized and their effect on
different HRV parameters, and consequently, on classification
of pathophysiology, clarified. Utilizing a fixed temporal window
such as 5 min can also affect the number of beats included as
it is a function of heart rate, and particularly, some HRV features such as standard deviation of the normal beats (SDNN) is
sensitive to beat numbers. Some HRV algorithms are sensitive
to nonlinearities, for example, applying fast Fourier transform
(FFT) to a 5-min RR interval window reduces the nonlinearity
effect and FFT provides a more robust result. Therefore, we
applied five preprocessing approaches and also investigated the
effect of different RR-interval tachogram lengths on the ability
of different HRV features to differentiate between nondiabetic
and diabetic patients with respect to ACE polymorphism.
II. MATERIAL AND METHODS
A. Participants
Data including ECG recordings and ACE genotypes were collected from 231 participants at the Charles Sturt University Di-

abetes Complications Screening Initiative (DiScRi). The study
was approved by the local human research ethics committee and
written informed consent was obtained by all participants prior
to this study. Since only Type-2 diabetes and normal participants
were of interest, five cases with type-1 diabetes or prediabetes
were excluded and 226 participants remained. To examine the
effect of different tachogram lengths, one subject was also excluded due to tachogram length being less than the required beat
number.
B. Genotyping
The QIAamp DA blood minikit (from Qiagen) was used to
extract genomic DNA from frozen blood samples, according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. 75 μL of the elution buffer
was used instead of 200 μL as the only modification to the
protocol in order to obtain a more concentrated solution of DNA.
The extracted DNA was then genotyped using the triple primer
method [34] and electrophoresis using a 6% polyacrylamide gel.
C. Groups
Subjects were divided into six groups according to their ACE
genotypes and diabetes status: with ACE genotypes of D/D, I/D,
and I/I, each categorized as normal or with T2DM.
D. HRV Analysis
ECGs were recorded by trained staff on Powerlab, with the
sampling rate of 400 Hz and a notch filter at 50 Hz using a lead
II configuration (ADInstruments, Powerlab, Australia). Patients
rested for 5 min before measurement. Data were collected between 9 and 11 AM for a period between 10 and 20 min for 231
subjects while resting in a supine position. Using the recorded
ECG, the RR-intervals were identified as the time difference
between two successive R peaks and instantaneous heart rate
in beats per min (bpm) was determined as 60/RR-intervals in
seconds based on the algorithm proposed by Pan and Tompkins
[35]. RR-interval series of 250, 300, 350, and 400 RR were
tested and the results compared.
1) Preprocessing:
Five preprocessing approaches were applied to the RRinterval sequences, before calculating HRV features.
1) (Method A and B): In the first two approaches, each interval that deviated by more than 10% (method A) or 20%
(method B) of the preceding interval, was marked as a
false. False intervals were replaced by the mean value of
its two adjacent intervals.
2) (Method C and D): The basis for method C and D is the
moving average technique. Five consecutive RR-intervals
were taken and the mean excluding the middle interval
calculated. If the middle beat interval deviated from the
mean value of the other four by more than 10% (method
C) or 20% (method D) of the mean, it was replaced by
the mean RR beat interval determined from the remaining
four intervals.
3) (Method E): The third method is the adaptive method,
comprised of three steps: deletion of the obvious errors,

MARZBANRAD et al.: METHODOLOGICAL COMPARISONS OF HRV ANALYSIS IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES

i.e., less than 200 ms long RR-intervals, applying an adaptive percent filter, and finally, applying an adaptive controlling filter. The details of the method is given in [36] and
summarized as follows. In the first step all R-R intervals
of less than 200-ms length were deleted as obvious errors.
Then, in the next step called the adaptive percent filter, the
sequence was first passed through a binomial-seven-filter:
tn =

the width (SD1) and the length (SD2) of the plot, which represents long- and short-term correlation of the nonlinear dynamic
system [41]. For each subject, SD1, SD2, and the ratio SD1/SD2
of the RR-intervals were calculated and used for further
analysis.
c) Autocorrelation Coefficient: To compute the autocorrelation coefficient, RR-intervals are partitioned into windows.
The overlap of the histograms for the consecutive windows are
then calculated as follows:

xn −3 + 6xn −2 + 15xn −1 + 20xn + 15xn + 1 + 6xn + 2 + xn + 3
.
64

(1)
The adaptive mean μa (n) and standard deviation (SD) σa (n)
values corresponding to each RR-interval were calculated adaptively from the filtered sequence. At each stage, if an RR-interval
differed from the previous one and the last valid sample by
more than 10% plus a generalized average threefold of the
mean adaptive SD (averaged over the whole sequence), the
interval was identified as a false beat. Since the interpolation
method for replacing the false beat may result in misleading beat to beat variability indices, in this method each false
beat was replaced by a random RR-interval length beat from
[μa (n) − 0.5σa (n), μa (n) + 0.5σa (n)]. In the final step, the
resulting sequence was again filtered by an adaptive controlling filter and the mean and SD were calculated for each RRinterval. Then, if one interval deviated from the corresponding
mean value for that interval by more than threefold SD plus a
basic variability (here 20 ms), then it was substituted with the
respective value of the filtered sequence.
2) HRV Features:
a) Time- and Frequency-Domain Methods: Several timedomain HRV features were used including: mean RR-intervals,
standard deviation of normal RR-intervals (SDNN), and the
square root of the mean squared difference of the successive RRintervals (RMSSD). Spectral powers in the very-low-frequency
(VLF) band (0.003–0.04 Hz) low-frequency (LF) band (0.04–
0.15 Hz), high-frequency (HF) band (0.15–0.40 Hz) were also
calculated. Then, power in each frequency band (PVLF ,PLF ,
and PHF ), the ratio (PLF /PHF ), and total power (TP) were
analyzed. Further details about these methods were described
in [37]. In this paper, power spectral density (PSD) is obtained
using Welch’s method [38]. The sampling frequency was set to
4 Hz. Spectral entropy (SE) derived from the PSD is calculated
based on VLF, LF, and HF powers as follows [39]:
SE = − PVLF × log2 (PVLF ) − PLF × log2 (PLF )
− PHF × log2 (PHF ).

where k is the RR-interval index at the beginning of the window,
τ denotes a shift from k, and pi (k) is the probability that an RRinterval falls into bin (i) of the histogram with N bins. The
coefficient A can measure the similarity of the similarity of
distributions (SOD), ranging from 0 where there is no similarity
and increasing to one with increasing similarity. In this study, the
average coefficient was calculated over all windows of length
50 beats, and the value of τ = 4 was chosen from the literature
[42], [43].
d) Complex Correlation Measure (CCM): CCM is based
on the multiplelag correlation of the RR-interval sequence.
Compared to the Poincaré plot indices, it evaluates variation
of the signal in more detail by point-to-point representation of
the variation of the Poincaré plot with a certain lag [44]. In this
paper CCM for lag m = 1 is used to compare different groups.
e) Tone-Entropy Analysis: The RR-interval time series is
defined as follows: RR ≡ (RR1 , RR2 , ..., RRN ), where N is
the total number of RR-intervals. The difference of the consecutive RR-intervals is associated with heart rate acceleration or
inhibition. Heart rate acceleration and inhibition are represented
by the plus and minus difference of RR-intervals, respectively.
In order to diminish the impact of heart rate variation over a long
period of time and different subjects, the RR-intervals are normalized by taking the difference of two successive RR-intervals
divided by the first interval and obtaining the percentage index
(PI) for the series. The first order moment (arithmetic average) of PI is then derived as tone, which shows the balance
between accelerations (PI > 0) and inhibitions (PI < 0) of the
heart rate. It is closely associated with the sympatho-vagal balance as shown in previous studies [45], [46]. Entropy is determined using the probability distribution of PI, based on Shannon’s formula [47]. It evaluates total acceleration/inhibition or
total variations of heart period, in the unit of bit.

paper and derived as [40]

b) Poincaré Plot Indices: The Poincaré plot is a practical
way to visualize a dynamic system in two dimensions based on
the intuitive display of the dynamic properties of a system from
a time series. The Poincaré plot is characterized by two indices;

E. Statistical Analysis
The distribution of the variables was non-Gaussian as ascertained by the Chi-square goodness-of-fit test, and nonparametric statistical analysis was used. The Kruskal–Wallis (KW)
test was employed to compare HRV features across different
groups (gene polymorphism and diabetes status). The p-value
of p < 0.05 was assumed significant. Moreover, the nonparametric Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon (MWW) test was used as the
post hoc test for pairwise analysis of HRV features.

III. RESULTS
A. Selecting the Preprocessing Method
The effect of the preprocessing techniques described in the
Methods section on HRV features was compared in terms of
discrimination between six groups with respect to the presence
of diabetes and ACE genotype. Numbers and demographic details of the subjects in each group are summarized in Table I.
Four hundred RR-intervals were used to calculate HRV features
for each subject. one subject was excluded due to insufficient
length of tachogram.
Table II shows the effect of preprocessing on discrimination
between the six groups. The threshold for allowed percentage
of variation had an effect on classification for deviation-based
(A,B) and moving average (C,D) methods. When the threshold
was set at 10%, HRV features resulted in better discrimination
with smaller p-values, when compared to a 20% threshold, particularly for the moving average-based method (C). The adaptive
method (E) provided the best results, in terms of the maximum
number of discriminating features. Therefore, this method was
used for further analysis. Detailed analysis of HRV for diabetic
and control with different ACE genotypes and pairwise comparisons will be discussed in the next sections.
The results of three preprocessing methods were also compared in more details for three simple cases, as illustrated in
Fig. 1: 1) the case of a single significant drop of RR-interval

(false beat), 2) a case of two consecutive false beats, and 3) a
third case of close but not consecutive false beats. Fig. 1 shows
the raw as well as preprocessed RR-intervals by methods A, C,
and E. In the first case, all three methods had a fairly similar
performance, however, it should be noted that method A and C
replace the false beat with an average of two or four neighbors,
which can make the heart rate trace more uniform and affect
the short-term variability as discussed in [36]. But the adaptive
method E, which led to the best discrimination in our study,
replaces the false beat by a random value in a certain interval
determined adaptively from the filtered RR-sequence [36]. The
simple replacement of the false beats by linear interpolation or
averaging over neighboring beats (method A and C), may fail to
correct the multiple false beats which occur close to each other,
such as in case 2 and 3 [see Fig. 1(b) and (c)]. It is observed that
in case 2, method A failed to correct two consecutive false beats
and the result of method C was affected by the multiple false
beats which fell into one window. Using method C, two false
beats changed the mean in each window significantly, which
resulted in unnecessary replacement of two (correct) beats preceding the false beats. However, method E only fixed the two
false beats and other beats were left intact. Similar to case 1,
in case 3, method A may make the sequence more uniform and
affect the short-term HRV, therefore, method E performs more
reasonable in this sense. Using method C, as shown in Fig. 1(c)
again two close false beats resulted in unnecessary change in

some errors may remain (such as the second false beat in case 2
when processed by method A), or some errors may occur during
preprocessing (such as the error in case 2, before the false beats,
when processed by method C). Another round of preprocessing may correct the remaining false beats. Method E has this

groups, when longer tachograms (350 and 400 RR-intervals)
were used, while 250 and 300 RR-intervals were too short to
reveal the differences. Therefore, we decided to use 400 RRintervals for further analysis, discussed in the following section.
C. Interaction of Diabetes and ACE Genetics
Detailed analysis results of the MWW test, for comparing
diabetic and control cases with different ACE genotypes are
shown in Table IV and V. Results show that the HRV difference
between genotypes was more significant in T2DM patients, than
control. Particularly most of the HRV features for I/I genotype
were significantly different from D/D and I/D. Significant differences were observed for both time- and frequency-domain
features. Tone and Entropy were significantly different only between I/I and D/D genotypes for T2DM patients. Fig. 2 shows
T2DM cases with I/I genotype had larger tone and smaller entropy. Another important result was that T2DM can be differentiated from control with most of HRV features, when the ACE
genotype was I/I. Significant differences were found for timeand frequency-domain features, as well as tone and entropy. For
example, as shown in Fig. 2, LF power was lower and HF power
was higher in T2DM patients with I/I genotype compared to
control. However, these differences were confined for D/D and
I/D genotypes. Overall, although many HRV features can differentiate between T2DM and control, it is mostly prominent for
I/I genotype. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of Poincaré plots for
two sample cases in I/I control and I/I T2DM groups, showing
greater SD1 and SD2 for the control compared to the T2DM
case.

B. Effect of Different RR-Interval Length
Different lengths of RR-intervals were then compared in combination with the adaptive method (E) for preprocessing. Results of applying the KW analysis in Table III indicated that
tachograms of length 400 RR-intervals provided the best results. Poincaré plot features could better differentiate between
groups when longer tachogram (400 RR-intervals) was used.
Total power was only significantly different between the six

IV. DISCUSSION
HRV analysis is noninvasive and can be determined using
wearable devices such as a Tum Tum watch, Fitbit, or mobile
phones and tablets. Heart rate and heart rate variability results
can be stored on the cloud for ease of access by physicians and
health care providers. HRV measures can be used to classify cardiac pathology and also as a biofeedback mechanism to reduce

stress and anxiety by initiating breathing exercises. Alterations
of HRV measures with disease, makes it applicable for diagnosis. According to previous studies, SDNN and RMSSD are
significantly different across normal and T2DM patients [12]
and also vary with ACE genotype [26]. More detailed results
were found in the current study by considering ACE polymorphism in conjunction with diabetes status and also analyzing I/I

and I/D ACE genotypes separately by optimizing the number of
RR-intervals and the preprocessing method.
In a study by Busjahn et al., HF power, RMSSD, and SDNN
were found to be significantly higher for D/D cases compared
to combined I/D and I/I cases [26]. Analysis of separate I/I and
I/D, in conjunction with diabetes in our study, showed that HF
power and SDNN were significantly smaller in I/I compared to

I/D and D/D, but only for T2DM patients. However, in this study
the age range of the cohort was older with 65 ± 10 to 70 ± 7 for
the analyzed groups compared to the previous study by Busjahn

et al. with a range of 34 ± 14 and 33 ± 14 for the different
groups. According to a study by Stein et al., which analyzed
HRV for younger (33 ± 4) versus older (67 ± 3) individuals,
RMSSD and HF showed significant differences between these
age groups [48], and therefore, could have been a factor that led
to the different result in our study compared to Busjahn et al.
Our results also showed the significant role of genetic polymorphism for the HRV results of diabetic patients. Although
HRV of T2DM and control were different when all genotypes were combined, separate analysis for each ACE genotype,
showed that these differences were mainly for I/I genotype.
Mean HR was not significantly different between genotypes in
the T2DM group, and therefore, the significant differences of
the HRV features for genotypes can be considered independent
of HR influence in the T2DM group. Furthermore, mean HR
of the Control group with I/I genotype is the only group with
different mean HR from the other groups investigated, while
other HRV features were mostly different for the T2DM group
rather than control, particularly with I/I genotype. Respiratory
rate was derived from ECG recordings using the Kernal PCA
[49], and was not significantly different among the groups.
Preprocessing has a strong influence on classification of
biosignals and is a necessary procedure for discrimination between different pathophysiologies using HRV analysis. A larger
variance for most HRV features within each group was observed
when no preprocessing was carried out before HRV analysis,
which may have masked the differences between the six groups.

Moreover, false beats present in the raw tachogram result in inaccurate HRV measures, which also affects the comparison between genotypes. Therefore, except for SD2 and mean RR, other
features were not significantly different between groups when
raw data were used. Simply replacing the false beats can also
affect the results. Replacement with interpolation can make the
heart rate trace more uniform and affect the short-term variability as discussed in [36]. However, the advantage of replacement
in the adaptive method, which led to the best discrimination between the ACE gene polymorphisms in our study, was based on
a random value in a certain interval, while other methods used
interpolation based on averaging. It is one of the reasons why
the adaptive method (E) performed better. Comparing results
for single and two close false beats also confirmed that method
E performed better than the deviation-based (A) and moving
average (C) methods. While method A failed to correct both
consecutive beats and method C may significantly change the
normal beats, method E only replaced the false beats. Method E
also has a stage which fixes any remaining false beats after the
first round of preprocessing.
In this practical example, the difference between the results
of the deviation-based (A or B) and moving average methods
(C or D) was negligible, which means that choosing a window
of two or five samples to detect and replace the excessively
deviated beats did not significantly affect the discrimination
results. However, generally better discrimination was obtained
with 10% threshold rather than 20%.
V. CONCLUSION
Results showed that HRV features can differentiate between
diabetic and control, particularly for I/I genotype. Diabetes also
has an important role in discrimination of the genotypes, as
the difference was present in conjunction with T2DM. Overall,
T2DM patients with I/I ACE genotype showed the most significant difference in HRV features. This study also showed that
preprocessing and different length of tachogram can change
the result of discrimination using different HRV features. In
all cases, using preprocessing unraveled significant differences
with smaller p-values compared to using raw tachogram. The
adaptive preprocessing method provided a better discrimination
in most cases. The length of tachogram was also important in
discrimination. Longer tachogram recordings seem to be better
for most of the HRV features to differentiate genetic polymorphism in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals and suggest that
if genetic polymorphism is to be used the standard 5-min ECG
recording may not be adequate. Furthermore, this study showed
that three genotypes have specific influence on cardiac autonomic neuropathy and it is not required to combine I/I and I/D
as has been suggested in previous studies.
