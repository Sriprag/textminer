Abstract—Alternative extrapulmonary oxygenation technologies are needed to treat patients suffering from severe hypoxemia refractory to mechanical ventilation. We previously demonstrated that peritoneal microbubble oxygenation (PMO), in which
phospholipid-coated oxygen microbubbles (OMBs) are delivered
into the peritoneal cavity, can successfully oxygenate rats suffering
from a right pneumothorax. This study addressed the need to scale
up the procedure to a larger animal with a splanchnic cardiac output similar to humans. Our results show that PMO therapy can
double the survival time of rabbits experiencing complete tracheal
occlusion from 6.6 ± 0.6 min for the saline controls to 12.2 ± 3.0
min for the bolus PMO-treated cohort. Additionally, we designed
and tested a new peritoneal delivery system to circulate OMBs
through the peritoneal cavity. Circulation achieved a similar survival benefit to bolus delivery under these conditions. Overall, these
results support the feasibility of the PMO technology to provide extrapulmonary ventilation for rescue of severely hypoxic patients.
Index Terms—Acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), airway obstruction, extrapulmonary ventilation, oxygen delivery.

I. INTRODUCTION
ATIENTS with airway failure or lung damage from disease
or trauma may develop life-threatening hypoxemia, caused
by the inability of the lungs to transfer oxygen to the blood. Even
with modern medical treatment, recent studies have shown that
patients suffering from respiratory failure experience a mortality
rate of 31–45% [1]-[4], with some reports of morality rates as
high as 75% [3], [5]. Mechanical ventilation may be inadequate
due to limited mass transfer in the damaged lung, and may even
exacerbate the condition by causing overinflation, barotrauma,
and cyclic closing and reopening of the alveoli, which can trigger
an inflammatory response and multiple system organ failure
[6]. Even if the lungs are healthy, treating hypoxemic patients
with inspired oxygen or intubation may not be possible due
to an airway obstruction or complex anatomy. Clinicians have

therefore sought a safe and effective method for extrapulmonary
oxygenation to treat hypoxemic patients.
If mechanical ventilation is inadequate, the last resort for
treating respiratory failure is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a temporary support of the respiratory and
cardiac systems requiring removal of blood from the body
to an external oxygenation device comprising artificial membranes, and reintroduction of the treated blood back into the
body [7]. ECMO has been used since 1972 [8], and its use
for treating respiratory failure has significantly increased in
the last decade owing to its effectiveness during the H1N1
flu pandemic [7] and a multicenter study showing improved
survival in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) [9]. Additionally, ECMO is now being used on patients undergoing surgical correction to airway obstruction [10].
Recent advances in ECMO include introduction of nonthrombogenic heparin-coated polymethylpentene hollow fibers, secondgeneration centrifugal pumps, and improved cannulae [11].
Despite these improvements and its proven clinical utility, ECMO presents significant technical complexity and cost,
which restrict its use in ambulatory situations. Additionally, the
invasiveness and risk of potentially lethal complications arising
from the mechanically powered high-flow extracorporeal circuit limits the clinical use of ECMO. In particular, powerful
anticoagulants (e.g., heparin) must be carefully administered
to patients and regulated to mitigate thrombogenic effects of
ECMO. These anticoagulants can cause unpredictable and lethal
intracranial brain hemorrhage among other complications [7],
[12]–[14].
Alternative oxygenation therapies are therefore necessary to
reduce the risk of hemorrhagic complications. The ideal therapy
would be simple, portable, cost effective, and able to provide
extrapulmonary ventilation (i.e., both O2 delivery and CO2 removal) on demand without the need for anticoagulants. One
exciting approach is to use the peritoneal cavity for extrapulmonary ventilation, which avoids removing blood from the body
[15]. Peritoneal ventilation uses the large surface area of the peritoneum, a serous membrane that lines the abdominal cavity, as
a gas exchanger. The peritoneum is a highly vascularized and
absorptive tissue receiving a significant fraction of the cardiac
output, and for this reason, the peritoneal cavity is often used
for systemic drug delivery [16] or as an alternative to hemodialysis [17]. Solutes can easily transport between blood and fluid
in the peritoneal cavity via diffusion through the mesothelium.
Peritoneal ventilation would rely on the transport of the rapidly
diffusing species oxygen and carbon dioxide into the blood of the
splanchnic capillary beds. Thus, when implementing peritoneal
ventilation, care must be taken to avoid high intraperitoneal pressure or other factors that could limit blood flow to the region.

LEGBAND et al.: EVALUATION OF PERITONEAL MICROBUBBLE OXYGENATION THERAPY IN A RABBIT MODEL OF HYPOXEMIA

Safe and rapid transabdominal catheterization techniques from
laparoscopic and indwelling catheter surgery could be adapted
for peritoneal ventilation; thus, making it suitable for long term,
short term, and possibly ambulatory care [18]–[21]. The central
purpose of peritoneal microbubble oxygenation (PMO) therapy
is to provide a versatile and safe treatment method to supplement
systemic oxygenation, either in tandem with current ventilation
practices, or by itself.
We recently demonstrated the first successful application
of peritoneal oxygenation using phospholipid-coated oxygen
microbubbles (OMBs) [15]. OMBs consist of oxygen gas microbubbles encapsulated by a phospholipid shell and polyethylene glycol brush layer. They were originally used with inert
gas as ultrasound contrast agents [22], [23], and have been rigorously characterized in prior work [24], [25]. OMBs provide
hydration to the peritoneum, as well as high gas carrying capacity and rapid mass transfer for the delivery of oxygen and
possible removal of carbon dioxide [26]. OMBs are designed
with a pure oxygen core, they have different composition, structure, and properties than fluorinated blood substitutes, such as
nanobubbles or nanodroplets [27], [28]. In our prior study, we
demonstrated that PMO by a single bolus of OMBs can eliminate
mortality and maintain normal levels of hemoglobin saturation
and heart rate in rats suffering from an otherwise lethal right
pneumothorax. This study addresses three critical goals for the
further development of the PMO technology: 1) to determine
whether PMO can extend life following complete loss of lung
function (rather than partial loss as in the right pneumothorax)
without resuscitation; 2) to scale up the procedure to a larger animal; and 3) to design and test a new delivery system to circulate
OMBs through the peritoneal cavity.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Oxygen Microbubble Generation and Characterization
All solutions were prepared using 0.2-μm filtered 18 MΩcm deionized water (Direct-Q, Millipore; Billerica, MA, USA).
Glassware was cleaned with 70 vol% ethyl alcohol (SigmaAldrich;, St. Louis, MO, USA) and rinsed with deionized water. Phospholipid 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DSPC) was purchased from NOF (Tokyo, Japan), and
polyoxyethylene-40 stearate (PEG40S) was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. DSPC and PEG40S were weighed and combined in a 9:1 molar ratio and, then, mixed with a filtered
solution of 0.1-M NaCl phosphate buffered saline to create a
final lipid concentration of 12 mg/mL. The mixture was then
heated to 10 °C above the main phase-transition temperature
(Tm) of DSPC using a digital stirring hotplate (Thermo Scientific; Asheville, NC, USA). The mixture was further dispersed
using a Branson 450 sonifier (Danbury, CT, USA) with an output
power of 5/10 until the solution was translucent. The lipid suspension was then stored in a refrigerator for OMB preparation.
OMBs were prepared by adapting the reactor design developed
by Swanson et al. [22] for synthesizing large volumes of OMBs.
The reactor consisted of an ultrasonic horn enclosed in a watercooled continuous flow chamber (Branson, Danbury, CT, USA).
The lipid suspension was cooled to 5 °C, and combined with

1377

oxygen gas in the flow chamber at roughly equal flow rates,
where they were emulsified at full sonifier power output into
a mixture of OMBs and macroscopic foam. OMBs were isolated from the macroscopic foam in a flotation column. OMBs
were then concentrated to ∼70 vol% by centrifuging at 110 relative centrifugal force units for 4 min, and stored in sealed 9-L
serum bottles under oxygen atmosphere. The lipid suspension
obtained by centrifugation was collected and recycled into the
reactor system to produce more OMBs. The process was repeated until ∼6 L volume of 70 vol% OMB was produced per
bottle. The gas headspace purity in the serum bottle was confirmed using a model 6600 precision headspace gas analyzer
(Illinois Instruments Inc.; Johnsburg, IL, USA).
B. In Vivo Rabbit Tracheal Occlusion Model for Hypoxemia
Our previous work showed successful bolus delivery of
OMBs to the peritoneal cavity and oxygenation in a rat right
pneumothorax model for hypoxemia [15]. In this study, a larger
animal model was chosen in order to take the next step toward
clinically relevance. The rabbit (male New Zealand white rabbit,
n = 19, 2.23 ± 0.18 kg) was selected as the animal model for
this study because the ratio of the intraperitoneal cavity volume
to its body mass is more similar to humans than that of the rat
[29]. Furthermore, the resting oxygen consumption rate of the
rabbit is lower than that of the rat owing to larger body mass,
which allows for a more relevant analysis to human therapy
[30], [31]. The larger body mass also increases the total oxygen demand and, thus, requires scale up of the manufacture of
OMBs.
All animal studies were performed in accordance with the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. To evaluate the PMO therapy, rabbits were
treated with either OMBs or saline as the control. Two infusion methods (bolus or circulation) were tested, resulting in
four groups: 1) saline bolus [(SB), n = 2]; 2) saline perfusion
[(SP), n = 2]; 3) OMB bolus [(OB), n = 9]; and 4) OMB perfusion [(OP), n = 6]. The SB and SP groups were limited to two
animals each (four animals total) as the use of more animals
was deemed excessive considering these four trials matched the
well-documented time of death for an untreated asphyxiation
rabbit model [32–34].
To model complete respiratory failure, the rabbit was intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT), which could be
hermetically sealed by occluding the end of the ETT with a
rubber membrane and plastic cap. Thus, all gas exchange in the
lungs was eliminated, causing the animal’s oxygen intake, as
well as carbon dioxide removal, to occur through OMBs, and
any extension of life was entirely due to PMO therapy. The experimental endpoint was cardiac arrest determined by cessation
of heartbeat and pulse. To prevent the disruption of hemodynamics, intraabdominal pressure (IAP) was monitored and kept
below 8 mmHg [35], [36]. The criterion for exclusion was the
rabbit being able to breathe around the sealed ETT; however,
no animals were observed to breath past the ETT once it was
sealed. During the experiment, body temperature, pulse rate,
and SpO2 were monitored in 8 s averages and recorded every

1378

30 s. The IAP and fluid infusion temperature were monitored
and recorded every second. Survival time was calculated as the
time between the ETT sealing (time = 0) and cardiac arrest (the
experimental endpoint).
Each rabbit was weighed before the procedure and, then,
sedated with 5% isoflurane to effect through a nosecone. The
throat was then sprayed with cetacaine and intubated with the
cuffed ETT (3 mm, JorVet). The ETT cuff was inflated and,
then, secured by cotton gauze tied around the head and front incisors. The rabbit was placed in the supine position on a warming pad (T/pump Classic, Gaymar), and the ETT was attached
to the anesthetic machine with the rabbit maintained on 2%
isoflurane. The abdomen was shaved and sterilized with betadine scrub and alcohol. A veterinary monitor (SurgiVet Advisor,
Smith’s Medical) was used to monitor vitals. A pulse oximetry
sensor (V1700, Smith’s Medical) was used to measure the pulse
rate and arterial oxygen hemoglobin saturation (SpO2 ). A temperature probe (WWV3418, Smith’s Medical) monitored body
temperature. Both sensors were placed rectally. An intramuscular injection of ketamine-xylazine solution (35–5 mg/kg dose,
35 mL/kg solution) was then given to anesthetize the rabbit for
the remainder of the procedure, while the rabbit was weaned
off of the isoflurane. Once completely weaned off isoflurane,
the ETT was disconnected from the anesthetic machine and the
rabbit was allowed to breathe room air. Once the rabbit was confirmed unresponsive to pain by paw pinches, a small incision
was made in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen for insertion of the fluid infusion tubing (3.2 mm inner diameter, Tygon)
into the peritoneal cavity. The incision was then sutured closed
around the tubing. A 12-gauge indwelling catheter was then inserted into the peritoneal cavity at the upper right quadrant of
the abdomen and connected to two pressure transducers (4426005G, Measurement Specialties Inc.) for measuring IAP via a
custom data acquisition system (myDAQ, LabVIEW, National
Instruments).

diameter, Tygon) was then attached to the port. The OMB or
saline perfusate was then pumped through an inline fluid warmer
(iWarm, Midmark) set at 40.4 °C and, then, into the peritoneal
cavity with a peristaltic pump (Thermo Scientific, FH100M) at
80 mL/min for 4 min, and then at 12.6 mL min-1 kg-1 thereafter. The IAP was maintained between 3 and 4 mmHg using a
36-V solenoid (ROB-10391, Sparkfun) driven valve to control
the fluid flow. Once circulation of OMBs or saline was attained,
the ETT was hermetically sealed. Infusion of fluid continued
until the time of death, after which the total infused volume
of was recorded. Fig. 2 shows the experimental process flow
diagram for the procedure.

C. Bolus Delivery of OMBs
Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the experimental setup for the
bolus technique. A single static volume of OMBs or saline is
injected into the cavity. The OMB or SB was pumped through
an inline fluid warmer (iWarm, Midmark) set at 40.4 °C and,
then, into the peritoneal cavity with a peristaltic pump (Thermo
Scientific, FH100M) at 80 mL/min for 4 min, and then at
12.6 mL min−1 ·kg−1 thereafter. The ETT was then hermetically sealed upon reduction of the pump. Fluid infusion lasted
until the IAP reached 5 mmHg, and the total infused volume of
fluid was recorded.

Kaplan–Meier survival curves (see Fig. 3) were created to
analyze the survival benefit of OMBs versus saline control.
A log-rank (Mandel Cox) test was performed for significant
differences between the groups (α = 0.01). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with separate means was performed to test the
overall differences among groups between the rate change of the
heart rate and SpO2 after the ETT was sealed. Multiple comparison tests of the means were performed to determine which
groups were significantly different (α = 0.05).

Fig. 1 shows a schematic of the peritoneal circulation technique, where fresh OMBs were continually perfused through
the peritoneal cavity to continuously deliver oxygen. To remove
OMBs from the peritoneal cavity, a medial incision was made
into the peritoneal cavity, and a customized OMB scavenging
port was inserted. A suture was then used to close the incision around the port collar. A scavenging tube (7.9 mm inner

PMO resulted in a significant increase in the survival time
of rabbits following sealing of the ETT (see Table I). Rabbits
treated with a bolus infusion of saline control (SB group) experienced cardiac arrest within 7 min. The rabbits receiving a
bolus injection of OMBs (OB group) had a mean survival time
of 12.2 ± 3.0 min, which was found to be significantly different
than for the SB group (X2 = 12.36, p = 0.0004).

All data is presented as average ± SD over the number of samples, n, in the
treatment group.

The temperature of the fluid infused into the peritoneal cavity
ranged from 20.5 to 28.0 °C and the IAP was maintained below
6 mmHg. The body temperature of the SB and OB groups
dropped slightly below the normal body temperature range for
rabbits of 38–40 °C [37], [38]; however, the body temperature
of all treated rabbits were in the range of 35–40 °C during the
period of fluid infusion (see Fig. 4). The slight decrease in body
temperature of the SB and OB groups resulted from the combination of anesthesia, shaving of the abdomen and peritoneal
infusion of fluid that was slightly cooler than body temperature.
This slight hypothermic condition was not enough to endanger
the rabbit or cause hypothermia based on the duration of the
procedure [39], [40].
Fig. 5(a) and (c) shows the average pulse rate for the bolus treatment groups. The SB group had pulse rates of 130–325
beats/min, which are within the normal range for a sedated rabbit
[37], [38], [41], while the OB group with the prolonged survival
time eventually experienced pulse rates below 130 beats/min.
Interestingly, the SB group experienced a rapid decline in pulse
rate following sealing of the ETT, whereas the OB group appeared to experience a steadier and less drastic decline in pulse
rate. Rabbits infused with OMBs showed a short period of stability in pulse rate 5–10 min after the ETT was sealed.
Fig. 6(a) and (c) shows the average blood oxygen saturation
(SpO2 ) for the bolus treatment groups. The SB group experienced a rapid decline in SpO2 following sealing of the ETT,
whereas the OB group experienced a steadier and less drastic decline in SpO2 . While the oxygen saturation was below a
healthy baseline of 90% in both groups, there appears to be an
overall improvement in SpO2 for the OB group compared to the
SB group. From a clinical view, however, the rabbits were not
well oxygenated as the SpO2 was around 60% for most of the

experiments. Note that a couple OB trials did have higher O2
levels (∼80%). Table II shows that no significant difference in
heart rate or SpO2 was indicated by ANCOVA.
B. Circulation of OMBs
Table I also shows data for experiments involving circulation of OMBs. The rabbits in this study had a baseline pulse
rate of 245 ± 40 beats/min and oxygen saturation of 87 ± 4%

when intubated and freely breathing room air. Rabbits receiving saline control (SP group) experienced hypoxic cardiac arrest within 7 min after complete asphyxiation by sealing the
ETT. Rabbits receiving a circulation of OMBs (OP group) had a
mean survival time of 10.8 ± 2.4 min, which was significantly
longer than the SP group (X2 = 8.33, p = 0.004). The survival
time for the bolus and perfusion groups were not significantly
different for either saline (X2 = 0.059, p = 0.808) or OMBs
(X2 = 0.705, p = 0.401).
The temperature of the fluid infused into the peritioneal cavity ranged from 20.5 to 28.0 °C, and the IAP was maintained
in the range of 2 to 4 mmHg. The body temperature of the OP
treatment group dropped slightly below the normal body temperature range for rabbits, but was in the range of 35–40 °C
during the period of fluid infusion (see Fig. 4). The body temperature of the SP group, on the other hand, decreased from 38
to 31 °C. The combination of saline inlet temperature that was
below body temperature, high heat capacity of the saline, and
circulation led to lower body temperatures in the SP group. This
was not seen in the OP treatment group because OMBs are 70%
O2 gas by volume and, therefore, have a lower heat capacity
than saline.
Fig. 5(b) and (d) shows the average pulse rate for the perfusion
treatment groups. Results between the OMB and saline control
groups were similar to those found above for bolus injection.
The OP group had heart rates within the normal range, while
the SP group experienced pulse rates below 130 beats/min. As
before, rabbits infused with OMBs showed a short period of
stability in pulse rate 5–10 min after the ETT was sealed.
Fig. 6(b) and (d) shows the average blood oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) for the perfusion treatment groups. The OP group
showed a significant increase in SpO2 compared to all other
treatment groups. Interestingly, the decline in SpO2 and heart
rate for the SP group began about 4 min before the ETT was
sealed, when infusion was initiated. The reason for this anomaly
is unknown.

LEGBAND et al.: EVALUATION OF PERITONEAL MICROBUBBLE OXYGENATION THERAPY IN A RABBIT MODEL OF HYPOXEMIA

Overall, the measured vitals of heart rate and oxygen saturation in the OMB treated rabbits showed less drastic decline than that of the saline treatment groups, but only the OP
method proved to significantly increase SpO2 . Also, as shown in
Table II, the SpO2 of the OP group was significantly different
from all other groups.
IV. DISCUSSION
Our first goal was to determine whether PMO can extend
life following complete loss of lung function. Based on these
results, we conclude that PMO therapy in a complete asphyxiation model significantly increases time to cardiac arrest by a
factor of 1.7. This increase was shorter than the at least 6.5fold increase in survival time that we previously reported for
PMO therapy in a rat lung injury model [15]. In the prior injury
model, however, we estimate that lung function was limited to
about 40% [42], possibly improving over the 2-h experimental timeframe as the underlying pneumothorax healed. In this
study, the sealed ETT reduced lung function to 0%. The significant improvement in survival time and oxygenation (SpO2 )
for PMO-treated animals over controls therefore demonstrates
the potential promise of this technology, even in the extreme
scenario of complete airway obstruction.
Our second goal was to scale up the procedure from rats to a
larger animal. One of the potential limitations of PMO treatment
is the limited amount of blood flow through the splanchnic circuit. In humans, only 20–30% of the total blood volume passes
through the peritoneal region [43], which is similar to rabbits
where total splanchnic circulation is 22% of the total blood flow
[44]. This limits the amount of oxygen that can be transported
from the peritoneum, which may explain the difficulty in maintaining normoxic levels in this complete asphyxiation model.
Our final goal was to design and test a new delivery system to circulate OMBs through the peritoneal cavity. While we
were able to achieve circulation, we found that the method of
infusion (bolus versus circulation) had no measured impact on
survival time in the complete asphyxiation model. This was an
unexpected outcome. In the circulation infusion method, OMBs
fully loaded with oxygen were continuously delivered into the
peritoneal cavity. However, no method was implemented to encourage complete mixing of OMBs in the peritoneal cavity before they exit circulation. It is possible that fresh OMBs exited
the cavity through the scavenge tubing before releasing their
oxygen load. Thus, transfer efficiency may have been negatively impacted for the continuous infusion method such that
it was analogous to a single bolus injection. In the future, this
will be confirmed by determination of OMB quality and gas
concentrations (O2 , CO2 , N2 ) directly before and after the treatment. Additional refinements of the circulation technique may
be needed to increase mass transfer between the OMB perfusate
and peritoneum.
The variance within the experimental groups merits future
investigation. Several factors could have caused this variability.
For example, rabbit weight, individual metabolism, and depth of
anesthesia all affect O2 consumption. The splanchnic blood flow
and vascularization of the peritoneum vary between animals and

1381

impact the diffusion rate of O2 into the body. Some of these
variables could possibly be controlled. For example, enhancing
splanchnic blood flow could be achieved by administration of
drugs such as cisapride [45]. Also, varying IAP levels could
be investigated in order to determine the pressure threshold for
vasculature collapse and its effect on OMB diffusion dynamics.
It is apparent from this study of total asphyxiation in rabbits
that our current PMO system was inadequate to provide 100%
of a sedated rabbit’s oxygen demand because animals showed a
gradual decrease in SaO2 before death. Our previous study [15],
however, showed that PMO could fulfill 60% of a rat’s oxygen
demand. If the therapy shows similar efficacy in humans as it
does in rats and rabbits, PMO therapy may be able to provide
supplemental oxygen for systemic oxygenation for a wide variety of respiratory conditions including lung injury, drowning,
asthma, sepsis, pneumonia, and other causes of ARDS.
