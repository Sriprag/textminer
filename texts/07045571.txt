Numerical Investigation of the Mechanisms
of Ultrasound-Modulated
Bioluminescence Tomography
Qimei Zhang, Melissa L. Mather, and Stephen P. Morgan∗

Abstract—Objective: A hybrid imaging technique, ultrasoundmodulated luminescence tomography, that uses ultrasound to modulate diffusely propagating light has been shown to improve the
spatial resolution of optical images. This paper investigates the underlying modulation mechanisms and the feasibility of applying
this technique to improve spatial resolution in bioluminescence
tomography. Methods: Ultrasound-modulated bioluminescence tomography was studied numerically to identify the effects of four
factors (reduced optical scattering coefficient, optical absorption
coefficient, refractive index, and luciferase concentration) on the
depth of light modulation. In practice, an open source finiteelement method tool for simulation of diffusely propagating light,
near infrared fluorescence and spectral tomography, was modified to incorporate the effects of ultrasound modulation. The
signal-to-noise ratios of detected modulated bioluminescent emissions are calculated using the optical and physical properties of
a mouse model. Results: The modulation depth of the bioluminescent emission affected by the US induced variation of local
concentration of the light emitting enzyme luciferase was at least
two orders of magnitude greater than that caused by variations
in the other factors. For surface radiances above approximately
107 photons/s/cm2 /sr, the corresponding SNRs are detectable
with the currently available detector technologies. Conclusion:
The dominant effect in generation of ultrasound-modulated bioluminescence is ultrasound induced variation in luciferase concentration. The SNR analysis confirms the feasibility of applying
ultrasound-modulated bioluminescence tomography in preclinical
imaging of mice. Significance: The simulation model developed
suggests ultrasound-modulated bioluminescence tomography is a
potential technique to improve the spatial resolution of bioluminescence tomography.

I. INTRODUCTION
IOLUMINESCENCE tomography (BLT) is based on the
generation of visible light by a living organism resulting
from an enzymatic reaction [1]. It is a sensitive technique that
can be used to monitor cellular events in living tissues [2].
Advantageously, BLT is characterised by extremely low background signals, short acquisition times (seconds to minutes),
and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) [3]. Moreover, due to its
noninvasive nature and capability to enable longitudinal studies,
it is expected to have a significant impact on the implementation
of strategies to reduce the number of animals used in preclinical
imaging within the principles of humane experimental techniques. The achievable spatial resolution of images in BLT is,
however, severely limited by the dominance of optical scattering
in bioluminescent photon propagation in tissue. Strategies have
been developed to help overcome the low resolution of BLT including the use of spectrally resolved BLT as a means to estimate
the depth of an object based on the wavelength dependence of
attenuation in tissue [4] and dual-modality molecular imaging
techniques that coregister BLT images with those from other
modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging or positron
emission tomography [2].
Alternative approaches to improve spatial resolution when
diffuse light dominates are photoacoustic tomography (PAT) [5]
and ultrasound-modulated optical tomography (USMOT) [6].
These are hybrid approaches which combine the advantages of
ultrasonic and optical imaging techniques. In PAT, ultrasound
(US) waves are excited by irradiating tissue with nanosecond
scale pulses of light. Optical absorption by specific tissue chromophores (e.g., haemoglobin, melanin, flavins) produces a small
temperature rise (less than 0.1 ◦ C) that generates a broadband
low-amplitude (less than 10 kPa) acoustic emission. Here, image
formation is based on the acoustic signals radiating from the surface of the sample, which are scattered much less in tissue than
light. This approach, however, is not applicable to BLT as there
is no pulsed light source present to generate acoustic waves. In
USMOT, light illuminates the tissue, and US is used to modulate
its optical properties (absorption coefficient, reduced scattering
coefficient, and refractive index) at a rate corresponding to the
US frequency, which subsequently produces frequency modulated light. By spatially confining the US beam, images based
on the optical properties of tissue localized within the US field
can be obtained via detection of the modulated light.
Conventionally, temporally coherent light has been used
in USMOT. Recently, however, ultrasound-modulated fluorescence tomography (USMFT) [7]–[9] was performed, which

demonstrates the feasibility of USMOT with short coherence
length light sources and, hence, its potential application in BLT.
A current difficulty of USMOT using low-coherence sources is
the weak modulation of light it produces, quantified by measurement of the modulation depth, which is defined as the ratio
between modulated light intensity (ac signal) and unmodulated
light intensity (dc signal) [8]. The modulation depth for USMFT
is of the order of 10−4 to 10−6 [10] as compared to 10−2 that is
achieved using a laser source. In relation to imaging, the use of
low-coherent light sources produces modulated optical signals
with low SNRs, and image quality is limited by the capabilities
of the signal detection device.
Unlike fluorescence, bio- (or chemi-) luminescence does not
require the use of excitation light to produce emission. In relation to imaging, this eliminates the possibility of background
signals being produced by the excitation light and any light generated by autofluorescence and, hence, improves the achievable
SNRs. This was recently demonstrated in a study that imaged
a tissue phantom containing a chemiluminescent material using ultrasound-modulated luminescence tomography (USMLT)
[11]. Here, the SNR was found to be 80, and the image lateral
resolution was 3 mm at a depth of 7 mm within a tissue phantom
with a scattering coefficient of 30 cm−1 . This represents a 3.5×
improvement in spatial resolution compared to the conventional
unmodulated optical tomography. More recently, a method to
reconstruct the density of a luminescent source in a highly scattering medium was presented based on the solution to a hybrid
inverse source problem for the diffusion equation [12]. Using
this approach, the spatial resolution in reconstructed images was
improved by a factor of 10 as compared to that in conventional
BLT. These studies provide support to the hypothesis that US
modulation techniques could be applied to improve the spatial resolution of BLT. The inverse problems of USMLT and
BLT are very similar as they aim to determine the source density distribution in the volume from boundary measurements of
multiple scattered light based on radiative transport. Therefore,
it can be expected that existing BLT reconstruction algorithms
can be modified to be applied in the reconstruction of USMLT.
The US will introduce small changes in optical properties in
local regions of the tissue sample, and so the measured data will
be weighted by these changes. The number of measurements
is significantly increased by scanning the US and detecting US
modulated luminescence signal, and this will aid in overcoming
the ill-posed inverse problem. For example, Bal and Schotland
[12] used multiple US frequencies to increase the number of
measurements and aid reconstruction.
In this study, the mechanisms of ultrasound-modulated bioluminescence tomography (USMBLT) are first studied numerically to identify the dominance of four factors [reduced
optical scattering coefficient, optical absorption coefficient, refractive index, and concentration of the bioluminescent target
(luciferase)] on the strength of light modulation. In practice, an
open source tool for simulation of diffusely propagating light,
near infrared fluorescence and spectral tomography (NIRFAST),
which simulates light propagation in biological tissue based on
the finite-element method (FEM), is modified to incorporate the
effects of US modulation. The feasibility of applying USM-

BLT to imaging preclinical models is also investigated by calculating the SNR of USMBLT using the optical and physical
properties of mice reported in the literature. Finally, strategies to
improve the SNR are discussed, as well as the future prospects of
USMBLT.
II. METHODS
A. Forward Light Modeling
The fluence rate of the US modulated bioluminescence
(USMBL) signal from a source located inside a tissue sample was calculated through modification of the open source
model of light transport NIRFAST. In this case, the fluence rate
(W/mm2 ) of bioluminescent photons detected at the surface of a
tissue sample can be calculated by calling the forward model in
NIRFAST, which solves the following diffusion approximation
of the radiative transport equation in the frequency domain [13]:
− ∇·k(r)∇Φ(r, w) + (μa (r) + iw/cm (r))Φ(r, w) = q0 (r, w)
(1)

where k(r) = 1/3(μa (r) + μs (r)) is the diffusion coefficient,
μa (r) is the absorption coefficient, μs (r) is the reduced scattering coefficient, Φ(r, w) is the photon fluence rate at the position
r, w is the modulation frequency, cm (r) = c0 /n(r) is the speed
of light in the medium, c0 is the speed of light in vacuum, n(r)
is the refractive index, and q0 (r, w) is an isotropic source term.
To solve the diffusion approximation by FEM, a tetrahedral
mesh for the volume of the tissue sample was generated containing an internal bioluminescence source and boundary data
[14]. The mesh was comprised of a number of elements joined
at vertex nodes. The optical properties of the sample were assigned to the mesh directly by using the graphic user interface
of NIRFAST. The simulations in this paper are based on (1).
B. US Modulation of Sample Optical Properties and
Luciferase Concentration
In order to investigate the underlying mechanisms of
USMBLT, the NIRFAST model was modified to account for
the US induced temporal oscillation of the sample optical properties (reduced scattering coefficient, absorption coefficient, and
refractive index). Changes in the bioluminescence intensity due
to the oscillation of luciferase concentration were also taken into
account.
A starting point for establishing a framework to simulate
USMBLT is consideration of the time dependent US field by
defining the term US(r,t)
US(r, t) = A sin(kr − wt)

(2)

where A = P0 /(wus ρ0 va ) is the particle displacement amplitude [15], which is a function of the US pressure, the US angular
frequency (wus ), the mass density of the sample (ρ0 ), and the
acoustic velocity in the sample (va ). P0 is the pressure amplitude
at the fundamental frequency at the US focal zone.
With reference to the literature [16] expressions for the
US induced variation in sample optical parameters can be

(3)

Δμs = μs0 [1 + 0.37ηk]US(r, t)

(4)

Δμa = μa0 kUS(r, t)

(5)

where Δn, Δμs , and Δμa are the changes in the refractive index, reduced scattering coefficient, and absorption coefficient,
respectively. Here, n0 , μs0 , and μa0 are the corresponding equilibrium refractive index, reduced scattering coefficient, and absorption coefficient in the absence of US modulation. k is
the wave vector, k = 2π/λus is the relative scalar, λus is the
US wavelength, and r represents the spatial position. η is the
elasto-optic coefficient, which is related to the adiabatic
piezooptical coefficient of the sample ∂n/∂p, ρ0 , and va such
that η = ∂n/∂pρ0 va2 [17].
The next parameter for which the effects of US are considered is the bioluminescence intensity (photons/s/L) from the
bioluminescence source. In the unmodulated case, the bioluminescence intensity generated from an ATP/luciferin-luciferase
solution can be expressed as [18]
Ilm 0 = QY kcat C0

(6)

where QY (photons/molecule) is the quantum yield of bioluminescence reactions and is defined as the efficiency of the
production of a photon from a single reactant molecule. kcat
(s−1 ) is the catalytic constant, which represents the turnover
number that indicates the maximum number of molecules of
substrate that an enzyme can convert to product per catalytic
site per second [18]. C0 (molecule/L) is the concentration
of the enzyme at the site of interest in the tissue (active
luciferase).
The enzyme concentration under the interaction of an US
field can be written as [19]
C1 = C0 (1 + βa P (r, t))

(7)

where βa = k/(ρ0 va w)|1 + ε̂ − i(ε̂ + 2/3ε̂2 )|/|1 + ε̂ − i[ε̂ +
4/9(ρ + 1/2)ε̂2 ]| + βa is the effective compressibility. The first
part describes the influence of particle oscillation, where ε̂ =
(wa2 /2γ)1/2 , a is the radius of the enzyme molecule, γ is the
fluid kinematic viscosity, ρ = ρl /ρ0 , ρl is the enzyme density,
which can be obtained from the molecule radius and the molar
mass. The second part describes the influence of volume changes
in tissue, where βa = 1/K is the compressibility of tissue, K =
va2 ρ0 is the bulk modulus, and P (r, t) = P0 sin(kr − wt) is
the acoustic pressure. Replacing C0 in (6) with C1 in (7), the
bioluminescence intensity under the interaction of the US field
is expressed as
Ilm = QY kcat C0 (1 + βa P (r, t)).

(8)

The relative variation of the bioluminescence intensity can
then be expressed from (8) and (6) as
Δq/q0 = |Ilm − Ilm 0 |/Ilm 0 = βa P (r, t).

A. Simulation Methods
The NIRFAST software tool was used to assign optical properties to nodes in the three-dimensional (3-D) mesh representing a tissue phantom. This assignment involved identification
of nodes that lay inside a specified US field, as calculated using (2), by comparing the spatial coordinates of the individual
nodes to that of the US field. Equations (3)—(5) were then used
to calculate the temporal and spatial variation of the tissue optical properties in this field. Nodes outside the US field were
assigned equilibrium properties of the tissue being modeled.
The optical parameters in (1) are time independent, however, in
practice, they will change with time under the influence of US
pressure. In this paper, the temporal change of the optical properties is simulated by mapping the US pressure distribution at
different phases within a period. The bioluminescence fluence
rates are calculated for each of these phases, which represent
one time point in the period. The temporal changes are then
obtained by connecting all these phases in sequence (as shown
later in Fig. 6).
The spatial coordinates of the bioluminescence source were
next specified. In practice, the region of the bioluminescence
source was divided into several layers along the direction of US
propagation, each with an allocated pressure. The bioluminescence intensity by each layer was then determined using (8).
Finally, the modulation depth was calculated using
m = |FUS − F |/F

(10)

where FUS and F are the bioluminescence fluence rates detected
at the surface in the presence and absence of US, respectively.
B. SNR Analysis of In Vivo Detection
Calculations were carried out to predict the SNR that could
be achieved in the in vivo application of USMBLT. These calculations were based on use of parameters relating to realistic
experimental configurations. Here, the detection system was
considered to consists of a PMT, transimpedance amplifier, and
lock-in amplifier (LIA). The SNR for such a system can be
expressed as
SNR = Pm /Pn

(11)

where Pm is the power of the detected modulated signal,
Pn = Pn s + Pdc + Pa is the total noise power, with Pn s , Pdc ,
and Pa relating to the noise arising from the bioluminescence
light (modulated signal and unmodulated signal), dark current, and ambient light level, respectively. Calculation of the
SNR also requires knowledge of the output voltage of the transimpedance amplifier. The output relating to the expression of
bioluminescence modulated by US with a frequency of fUS is
vAC = VAC sin(2fUS t)

(12)

VAC = 2SLAC hf EAno RM

(13)

where S is the effective area of the PMT, LAC
(photons/s/cm2 /sr) is the modulated surface radiance, h is
Planck’s constant, f = c/λ is the light frequency, and λ is the

2138

light wavelength. EAno is the anode radiance sensitivity of the
PMT in the bioluminescence wavelength, R and M are the
input impedance and gain of the transimpedance amplifier, respectively. Thus, the power of the optical modulated signal can
be expressed by
2
/2.
Pm = VAC

(14)

For a PMT, the current measured at the anode is the result
of the multiplication of electrons emitted at the cathode, the
number of which follows a Poisson random process. Here, the
mean number of electrons (N ) detected was considered, with
N being the number of electrons at the cathode within a time
period of Δt
N = ICath Δt/e

(15)

where
ICath = 2S(LAC + LDC )hf ECath

(16)

is the cathode current, e is the electron charge, LDC is the
unmodulated surface radiance, LAC = mLDC , m is the modulation depth, and ECath is the cathode radiance sensitivity. The
shot noise X can be expressed as
X =N −N

(17)

the noise current at the anode is
IAno = XeG/Δt

(18)

where G is the PMT gain. The noise related to the voltage output
from the transimpedance amplifier is
V = IAno RM.

(19)

Thus, the variance of the noise voltage is
δ 2V = (eGRM /Δt)2 δ X 2
2

(20)

2

where δ X = δ N = N according to the property of Poisson process. Following Parseval’s theory the total noise power
equals twice the variance of the noise voltage; thus, the output
noise power due to signal is
Pn s = 2δ V 2 .

(21)

The calculations are based on the assumption that a LIA is used
in detection. If it is supposed for a time window of Δt, the
bandwidth of the LIA is given by B = 1/(2Δt), the bandwidth
of the system is B as well. The output noise power due to signal
can thus be expressed as

(22)
Pn s = (2 eICath BGRM)2 .
C. Simulated Experiment
The simulation experiment was based on a simplified version
of an experimental system used in previous studies of USMLT
performed in our laboratory using a chemiluminescent source
[11]. Here, the tissue phantom was modeled as a rectangular
slab (55 mm × 55 mm × 15 mm) containing a cylindrical bioluminescent source (1-mm diameter, 5-mm height) in the centre
of the slab (see Fig. 1). The detection system was modeled as a

Fig. 1. Simulated experimental setup based on a simplified version of the
system used in [11] with the tissue phantom being was modeled as a rectangular
slab (55 mm × 55 mm × 15 mm) containing a cylindrical bioluminescent
source (1-mm diameter, 5-mm height) at a depth of z = 0.5 mm. The US focal
zone (green) was simplified as a 2-mm diameter, 18-mm-long cylinder, and the
detector (blue) as a disk located at z = 7.5 mm.

PMT and aperture, which were approximated as a circular disk
detector (8 mm) located on the surface of the tissue phantom.
The mesh generation tool in NIRFAST was then used to discretize the tissue phantom slab and cylindrical bioluminescent
source into tetrahedral elements with average edge lengths of
0.2 and 0.3 mm using the Delaunay Triangulation method. The
circular detector was discretized into triangles of average edge
length of 0.2 mm using the same tool. These element sizes were
chosen as they are sufficient small to confer numerical stability and accuracy to the diffusion computations without being
computationally expensive. The vertices of the Delaunay triangulation were used as point sources and point detectors forming
the source and detector, respectively.
The US field was considered to be generated by a focused
US transducer with the focal zone being approximated as a thin
cylinder (2-mm diameter, 18-mm long). Only the US field in
this focal zone was considered in the simulation, where it was
assumed to propagate without attenuation in a linear manner
as a plane wave with stratified pressure amplitude variation
along the long axis of the cylinder. Although the primary aim
of this simulation is to investigate the feasibility of USMBLT in
preclinical imaging, it is useful to briefly compare the simulated
data with the experimental results obtained in phantom studies
previously [11]. In this case, a modulation depth of 3.6 × 10−4
(ac/dc = 3.6 μV/10 mV) was obtained for a phantom with μs =
0.21 mm−1 and μa = 0.00005 mm−1 [11] at an US frequency
of 1 MHz and peak pressure at the focal zone of 0.42 MPa.
Using the simulation described in this paper, the modulation
depth at the same frequency, pressure, and optical properties
was calculated to be 2.1 × 10−4 . Differences can be attributed
to values of parameters [e.g., parameters used to calculate the
effective compressibility in (7)], measurements errors in the
experiments (e.g., peak US pressure), and assumptions made in
the solutions (e.g., perfect focused US). These are discussed in
more details in Section IV.

The parameters used in simulations were based on the literature values of the optical and physical properties observed in
biological tissue [22] and luciferase [18] as listed in Table I. Calculation of the SNR in the simulated experiment was based on
the parameters of instrumentation used in previous experimental
studies [11]. Table II shows values taken from the datasheets of a

which were found to lie in the range of 106 photons/s/cm2 /sr to
1011 photons/s/cm2 /sr[23], [24].
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. US Modulation of Sample Optical Properties and
Luciferase Concentration
The US induced changes in the reduced optical scattering
coefficient, optical absorption coefficient, refractive index, and
luciferase concentration dependent bioluminescence emission
intensity relative to their equilibrium values were investigated
as a function of US pressure using (3)–(5), and (9). The applied
US field is obtained using (2) and it is over a medically relevant
pressure range up to 10 MPa and with an arbitrary frequency
of 1 MHz. Fig. 2 shows these relative changes of Δμs /μs0 ,
Δμa /μa0 , Δn/n0 , and Δq/q0 . Results are shown for the pressure maximum in the US cycle, which is frequency independent.
Over the pressure range considered, a linear increase in the parameter change is seen with pressure. This relationship is clear
from inspection of (3)–(5), which describe the optical properties
of the tissue phantom. The absolute value and rate of change for

Δn/n0 was the lowest of these parameters, which corresponds
to the smallest constant in (3). The change in Δq/q0 with pressure from (9) is predicted to be proportional to the applied US
pressure as well and it undergoes the greatest change.
The corresponding changes in modulation depth of the detected signal arising individually from Δμs /μs0 , Δμa /μa0 ,
Δn/n0 , and Δq/q0 over the 0 to 10 MPa pressure range studied in Fig. 2 were also calculated. Fig. 3 shows the parameter
with the greatest effect on modulation depth is the change in the
bioluminescence emission intensity. Fig. 3 also shows a linear
increase in the modulation depth with US pressure for all four
parameters studied. This linear relationship between modulation

depth and US pressure is in agreement with the analytic solution
obtained by Yuan et al. [19] and the recent experimental results
from Jarrett et al. [25] that demonstrated this for the case of a
fluorescent source and an LED source, respectively. Although
all parameters studied show a linear trend with pressure, their
absolute values and rates of change vary considerably. In fact,
the bioluminescence intensity due to the US induced change
of luciferase concentration [see Fig. 3(d)] is approximately two
orders of magnitude greater than that caused by changes in the
reduced scattering coefficient [see Fig. 3(a)] and absorption coefficient [see Fig. 3(b)] and of the order of 105 times higher than
that related to changes in the refractive index [see Fig. 3(c)]. Of
note also is the observation that the modulation depth magnitude
calculated for the case of change in bioluminescence intensity is
comparable to the levels reported previously in chemiluminescence [11] and fluorescence [8] experimental results and those
predicted theoretically for fluorescence [19].
The dominance of luciferase concentration dependent
changes in bioluminescence intensity on the modulation depth
were further investigated by studying the affect luciferase concentration has on the US modulated signal and modulation
depth over a biologically relevant concentration range of 10 to
100 mg/ml. Fig. 4 shows the results of these calculations. Here,
the normalized US modulated signal is shown to investigate the
trend with concentration which was found to vary with the concentration linearly. This linear relationship of modulated signal
with source concentration is consistent with the expression (18)
derived in [26]. It should also be noted that in [27], the US modulated fluorescence signal was observed to only increase when
the fluorophore concentration is low and it will decrease in the
high concentration region. This is due to the inner filter effect,
in which the excitation light is mostly absorbed by the fluorescent molecules near the light input region, and the fluorescence
emission is reabsorbed by the fluorophores along the light transmission path in an optically dense solution [28]. However, the
process of generating bioluminescence does not require excitation light for light emission thus no inner filter effect exists for
USMBLT. This is an advantage of USMBLT when the USMBL
signal is used to quantify the luciferase concentration because
the relationship is much simpler. The modulation depth is invariant with luciferase concentration as shown in Fig. 4(b) because
the modulated bioluminescence signal and unmodulated signal
have the same trend with luciferase concentration.

Fig. 5. Oscillation of Δq/q0 over one US period at a frequency of 0.75 MHz.
The relative phase of the US is labeled on the x-axis.

The spatial variation of US induced changes in Δq/q0 and
the corresponding modulation depths detected as US propagates
through the focal zone were studied. These variations are a result of the sinusoidal nature of the modeled US wave, which
produces a spatial and temporal variation in pressure along the
focal zone, both of which are a function of the applied US
frequency. Fig. 5 shows the variation in Δq/q0 caused by a
0.75 MHz, 1 MPa US wave along the length of the bioluminescence source (x-direction) over a time frame corresponding to
one period of wave oscillation.
The observed spatial variation in Δq/q0 as the sound propagates is a result of the changing US pressure distribution and
affects the modulation depth of the detected signal. The modulation depth for US frequencies of 0.75, 1.5, and 2.25 MHz
was also calculated. The pressure distributions set up by each
frequency will vary as a result of their differing wavelengths and
their size relative to that of the bioluminescence source. Here,
the 1-mm diameter source simulated corresponds to distances
equal to λ/2, λ, and 3λ/2, respectively of the three frequencies studied. The resulting variation in modulation depth for
these three conditions was calculated and is shown in Fig. 6. It
should be noted that Fig. 6 includes US induced changes in the
reduced optical scattering coefficient, optical absorption coefficient and refractive index but these are dominated by changes in
concentration.
The modulation depth is shown in Fig. 6(a) to be a maximum
when the phase is 0, at which time the relative change of source
intensity is even symmetrical, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The oscillation of the modulation depth is due to the summation of USMBL
signals originating from each layer of the source region along
the US transmission direction at the detector. When the US pressure distribution is even symmetrical to the centre axis of the
cylindrical source, the USMBL signals from two symmetrical
layers of the source are in phase and sum constructively at the
detector so the modulation depth is the highest. When the US
pressure distribution is odd symmetrical to the centre axis, the
USMBL signals from the two symmetrical layers of the source
are out of phase and sum destructively at the detector so the
modulation depth is the lowest. It should be noted that when the

model propagation to, and pressure distribution within, the focal
zone more accurately.

phase sum or absolute difference is π, the modulation depths
are the same. This is because the pressure distributions within
the source region at these conditions are either odd symmetrical
or even symmetrical with each other [e.g., (b) and (d) in Fig. 5].
Since modulation depth is an absolute value, its frequency is
twice that of the US. A similar trend is observed in Fig. 6(b)
and (c) with the modulation depth varying at twice the US frequency. Interestingly, the maximum modulation depth is found
to decrease with increase in frequency over the range studied. It
is thought that this observation is related to the size of the bioluminescence source and the US frequency as has been observed
in studies of USMFT [8].
It should be noted that these findings are based on simulations of a simplified experimental situation in which the tissue
phantom is considered to be homogenous, unlike the case of
real biological tissue. In addition, US propagation to the focal
zone is not modeled, and only the pressure at the fundamental
frequency is considered in this paper with lock-in detection being applied to extract this component. It should be noted that, in
the presence of nonlinear propagation, generation of harmonic
components will mean that higher US amplitudes will need to be
generated at the transducer in order to generate sufficient pressure at the fundamental frequency. Within the US focal zone
the effects of attenuation, absorption, scattering, and beam divergence are also neglected. A more sophisticated model would
make all the speed related parameters in Section II functions of
position and time instead of constants. Further work will involve
incorporation of these effects into the NIRFAST software tool
through the use of an acoustic toolbox such as k-wave [29] to

The effect of PMT diameter, surface radiance of bioluminescence, and modulation depth on the SNR of the USMBLT system were analyzed based on the method described in Section II.
Fig. 7 shows the SNR calculated for six different surface radiances (106 , 107 , 108 , 109 , 1010 , and 1011 photons/s/cm2 /sr as a
function of PMT diameter with an RMS modulation depth of
4.8 × 10−4 [see Fig. 7(a)] and as a function of modulation depth
for a fixed PMT diameter of 8 mm [see Fig. 7(b)]. The contribution of the ambient light and the dark current to the noise power
was estimated based on a noise voltage level of 0.4 μVrm s , as
detected in a previous experiment [11].
The feasibility of applying USMBLT to preclinical imaging is
contingent on detection of modulated optical signals within the
noise limits of current detector technologies. Results in Fig. 7 are
based on calculations for a mouse model with detector capabilities matching that of a PMT used in previous experimental studies (Hamamatsu H5783-20). Inspection of Fig. 7(a) shows SNRs
achieved with radiances ranging from 106 photons/s/cm2 /sr to
107 photons/s/cm2 /sr fall below the noise level of the simulated
detector. However, for radiances above 107 photons/s/cm2 /sr the
SNRs are comfortably within the limits of the detector modeled
in [11]. Apart from changing the radiance, the SNR can also be
improved by increasing the PMT diameter as seen in Fig. 7(a)
and the modulation depth as shown in Fig. 7(b). It is noted that
the nonlinear relationship of SNR with respect to radiance was
caused by the 0.4 μVrm s noise voltage level from dark current
and ambient light.
Overall there are good prospects for the application of
USMBLT in preclinical imaging. Besides, considerable effort
has been directed to establish novel luciferases that can exert
a brighter, stable, and red-shifted bioluminescence by mutation
[30], [31], DNA optimization [32], or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer with fluorescent proteins [33]. A novel
luciferase NLuc has also been established that can emit approximately hundredfold brighter and more stable bioluminescence
than the gene firefly luciferase (Fluc) studied here [34]. Such

2142

signal improvement will lead to greater SNRs and enhance the
quality of USMBLT images. Other strategies to improve the
modulated optical signal relate to the use of US microbubble contrast agents that have high compressibility and as such
have the capability to increase the change in the bioluminescent
source intensity as indicated by (9) [7].
V. CONCLUSION
In this study, numerical simulations were carried out to investigate the mechanisms dominant in generation of USMBL
signals using the NIRFAST software tool. Simulations were
based on the optical and physical properties of a mouse model
and detection capabilities of instrumentation used in previous
experimental work. Results demonstrate that the dominant effect
in generation of USMBL is US induced variation in luciferase
concentration. This effect was determined to be approximately
two orders of magnitude greater than that caused by changes in
the reduced scattering coefficient and absorption coefficient and
of the order of 105 times higher than that related to changes in
the refractive index.
The effect of US frequency on modulation depth was also
studied. Depending on the distribution of the sinusoidal pressure
along the US transmission direction, the USMBL signals can
sum either constructively or destructively at the detector, which
results in an oscillation of the modulation depth over time. The
results here predict the modulation depth varies at twice the
US frequency, and its absolute value is a function of the US
wavelength relative to the bioluminescence source size.
The SNR analysis results confirm the feasibility of applying
USMBLT in preclinical imaging of mice to improve the spatial
resolution of BLI. It was determined that for surface radiances
above approximately 107 photons/s/cm2 /sr the corresponding
SNRs are detectable with devices currently used in experimentally [12]. The development of novel luciferases that can exert
bioluminescence above such radiance levels will further aid the
practical application of the technique. The measured USMBL
signal has the potential to provide additional data for BLI reconstruction to make the reverse problem better conditioned.
