The Effects of HCN and KLT Ion Channels
on Adaptation and Refractoriness in a Stochastic
Auditory Nerve Model
Mohamed H. Negm, Student Member, IEEE, and Ian C. Bruce∗ , Senior Member, IEEE

Abstract—An accurate model of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs)
may assist in developing improved cochlear implant (CI) stimulation strategies. Previous studies have shown that the original
Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) model may be better at describing nodes
of Ranvier in ANFs than models for other mammalian axon types.
However, the HH model is still unable to explain a number of phenomena observed in auditory nerve responses to CI stimulation
such as adaptation to high-rate stimulation and the time course of
relative refractoriness. Recent physiological investigations of ANFs
have shown the presence of a number of ion channel types not considered in the previous modeling studies, including low-threshold
potassium (KLT) channels and hyperpolarization-activated cation
(HCN) channels. In this paper, we investigate inclusion of these ion
channel types in a stochastic HH model of a single node of Ranvier.
Simulation results for pulse trains with rates of 200, 800, and 2000
pulse/s suggests that both the KLT channels and HCN channels
can produce adaptation in the spike rate. However, the adaptation
due to KLT is restricted to higher stimulation rates, whereas the
adaptation due to HCN is observed across all stimulation rates.
Additionally, using pulse pairs it was found that KLT increased
both the absolute and the relative refractory periods. HCN on its
own increased just the relative refractory period, but produced a
synergistic increase in the absolute refractory period when combined with KLT. Together these results argue strongly for the need
to consider HCN and KLT channels when studying CI stimulation
of ANFs.

I. INTRODUCTION
OCHLEAR implants (CIs) are prosthetic devices used to
restore hearing for severely deaf individuals. CIs stimulate
the auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) by applying electrical current
pulses via an electrode array inserted inside the cochlea. From
a relatively early stage in CI development, there has been an
interest in using very high pulse rates (e.g., [1]), but speech perception does not necessarily improve at higher stimulation rates
(e.g., [2]). The variability across patients in the optimal stimulation rate motivates a better understanding of the neurophys-

iological mechanisms underlying ANF responses to high-rate
electrical stimulation.
Analyses of the refractory properties of feline ANFs for electrical stimulation have shown that on average they have very
fast refractory recovery compared to other types of neurons
[3]–[5]. However, there is a substantial amount of variability in
refractory periods between different ANFs, and a large subset
of ANFs exhibit an extended period of relative refractoriness
lasting to at least 4 ms (see [3, Fig. 8] and [4, Fig. 7]). Extended refractoriness in a subpopulation of ANFs has also been
observed in human CI subjects [6], [7]. Stimulation with pairs
of pulses has also demonstrated facilitation (also referred to as
summation or sensitization) for spike generation in response to
the second pulse in cases, where the first pulse did not elicit a
spike [3], [5], [8]. Facilitation time constants for feline ANFs
are in the order of 100 to 400 μs and are partly dependent on
the site of spike generation [5]. Evidence of facilitation has also
been observed in human CI users [6] and in guinea pig ANFs
for pulse-train stimulation [9]. After the period of facilitation is
over for a subthreshold first pulse, a period of accommodation
(also referred to as subthreshold masking or desensitization) can
be observed in some ANFs [8], during which the threshold current for the second pulse is increased relative to the first-pulse
threshold current, in contrast to the decrease that occurs during
the facilitation period. Accommodation has also been observed
for high-rate pulse trains [8], [10]. In addition, ongoing spiking
from high-rate pulse trains produces spike-rate adaptation in
ANFs [10]–[13], although for a continuous pulse train with a
fixed amplitude it is difficult to disentangle the effects of refractoriness, facilitation, accommodation, and adaptation.
Several computational models have been developed to describe ANF behavior. Many of these have been based on the
deterministic Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) model [14]. In their extensive study, [14] modeled the fast sodium and delayed rectified potassium ion channels of the squid giant axon at 6.3 ◦ C.
Cartee showed that the temperature-adjusted HH model may
be a better model for ANFs than alternative models developed
for other myelinated nerve fibers [15]. However, Verveen and
Derksen reported significant stochastic fluctuations in membrane potential from myelinated nerve fibers of a frog [16],
which suggested that the deterministic HH equations may provide an impoverished description of real neural membranes.
The magnitude of these fluctuations in membrane potential is
inversely proportional to node diameter [17]. An average diameter of an axon at a node of Ranvier for a mammalian ANF ranges
between 2 and 4 μm, and many nodes are even smaller [18].

Therefore, the noise activity in membrane potential becomes
more significant when dealing with ANFs. Bruce et al. subsequently showed that stochastic models for ANFs better predict
physiological responses and psychophysical performance [18].
Therefore, recent versions of HH-based ANF models have typically used stochastic ion channel implementations [10], [19]–
[28]. However, the refractoriness, facilitation, accommodation,
and adaptation properties of AN responses to CI stimulation are
still not completely described by any of these models.
A number of physiological studies have shown the presence
of different ion channel types in cultured spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) soma1 [29]–[33], other than the fast voltage-gated
sodium (Nav ) and delayed rectifier potassium (Kv) channels of
the HH model. These physiological experiments suggest that
the diversity in ion channel types and distribution affect the
firing properties and participate in the signal coding and transformation in the auditory periphery [30], [33]. Among these
channels are voltage-gated hyperpolarization-activated cation
(HCN) channels and voltage-gated low-threshold potassium
(KLT) channels that permit the passage of Ih and IKLT currents,
respectively. Ih is an inward rectifier current that is observed in
different regions across the lower auditory system, such as the
SGN soma [30], [31], [34], ANF peripheral terminals [34], a
variety of ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) neurons [35]–[38],
the medial superior olive (MSO) neurons [39], and lateral lemniscus [40]. Ih is characterized by being a mixed cation current
(channels are permeable to both sodium and potassium ions),
the reversal potential is more positive than the resting membrane
potential, and it has slow activation/deactivation time constants
[30]. Ih contributes also in determining the resting potential
[38], at which Ih is partially activated, and controls the spontaneous and evoked firing rates. Ih has heterogeneous activation
characteristics [30], i.e., reversal potential, half-maximal voltage V1/2 , and slope factor k that are attributed to endogenous
regulatory mechanisms that differ from one neuron to another
in the spiral ganglion.
IKLT tends to colocalize with Ih , being found in the SGN
soma [32], [33], VCN cells [36], [41], and MSO neurons [39].
KLT channels may also be present in ANF central-axon nodes
of Ranvier [42], where HCN channels are not thought to be expressed. Like Ih , IKLT is partially activated at rest and works
with the high-threshold Kv channels in repolarizing the membrane, shortening the duration of synaptic potentials and action
potentials [33], [36]. IKLT has relatively slow dynamics, such
that it produces adaptation in spiking to sustained current injections [32], [33], [43]. It exhibits variability in the amount slow
inactivation, with an average of around 50% inactivation [36].
The characteristics of Ih and IKLT suggest that these two
channel types could play an important role in determining the
temporal response properties of ANFs to electrical stimulation
from CIs. In this paper, we present a model for a patch of
membrane, at the node of Ranvier of an ANF. Four stochastic
1 The terminology of ANF and SGN are used somewhat interchangeably in
the literature. However, in this study, we will mainly use SGN when referring
to the cell body (or soma) and ANF when referring to the peripheral or central
processes (or axons).

ion channels are modeled. The two channels 1) KLT and 2)
HCN channels are incorporated in the model together with the
classical fast Nav and delayed rectifier Kv of the HH model.
We utilized the channel models of [36], based on the thoroughly characterized channel properties from VCN cells [44],
[45]. In a preliminary study with an early version of this model,
we showed that these channels can effect single-pulse response
properties, particularly for long-duration pulses [46]. In this
paper, our analysis focuses on the adaptation and refractory
properties of the model. A preliminary version of parts of this
work has been reported [47]. The simulation results suggest
that Ih and IKLT currents can have a strong effect on the intrinsic response properties of ANFs to CI stimulation and should,
therefore, be incorporated in computational models of ANFs.

II. METHODS
A. Membrane Model
A single node of Ranvier in a mammalian ANF was modeled.
The node consisted of four voltage-gated ion channel types,
which are: 1) fast sodium (Nav ) channels; 2) delayed-rectifier
potassium (Kv) channels; 3) KLT channels; and 4) HCN channels that controlled the passage of INa , IK , IKLT , and Ih currents, respectively. A passive leakage channel was included (that
produced the Ilk current) with the reversal potential Elk adjusted
for each version of the model to maintain a constant resting
membrane potential at −78 mV. The equivalent circuit of the
model is shown in Fig. 1 and the model parameters are given in
Table I. The single channel conductances and temperature scaling coefficients for the HCN and KLT channels in ANFs have
not yet been published, so values were chosen based on advice
from research groups who study these channels in auditory neurons. Likewise, the channel densities are not known for these
channels, so plausible values that give reasonable behavior were
chosen for the default channel counts. The effects of the channel
counts on the model response properties were investigated in a
sensitivity analysis.

C. Data Analysis
The responses of four versions of the model were compared.
These versions are: 1) the standard (stochastic) HH model; 2)
the HH model with Ih alone added; 3) the HH model with IKLT
alone added; and 4) the HH model with both Ih and IKLT added.
The membrane potential was calculated by integrating (1) using
Euler’s method with a time step of 1 μs.
The stimulus current for a stochastic ion channel is represented in terms of FE, which is an estimate of the probability
of a nerve fiber to create an action potential in response to a
certain current stimulus input level [16]. The relation governing
the spiking probability and the stimulus level is well fit by an
integrated-Gaussian function

where Vm is the membrane potential, Cm is the membrane
capacitance, and Iinj is the stimulus current.
A channel-number-tracking (CNT) algorithm [48] was utilized to represent the stochastic fast sodium [49] and delayedrectifier potassium [23] channels. Independent gating particles
were assumed to follow a Markov jumping process [23], [49].
The Markov jumping process approach and the CNT algorithm
were extended to represent stochastic gating particles of HCN
and KLT channels. The model ion channel kinetics were set for
a mammalian body temperature of 37 ◦ C. A complete list of
equations is given in the Appendix.
B. Stimuli
For simulations of pulse train responses, the model behavior
was simulated for a period of 200 ms without any current injection, to allow for fluctuations in the stochastic model away from
the initial conditions, and was subsequently injected intracellularly by a continuous train of current pulses for 300 ms. Each
pulse was a symmetric, charge-balanced, biphasic, depolarizingphase-leading pulse with a duration of 50 μs/phase and no interphase gap. Stimulus rates were chosen at rates similar to those
used in CIs [12], [13].
For the refractory analysis, a pair of symmetric, chargebalanced, biphasic, depolarizing-phase-leading pulses were utilized. The pulses were 75 μs/phase with an interphase gap of
75 μs/phase. The amplitude of the first pulse was sufficiently
large (50 pA) to always generate an action potential, and the
second pulse was varied in amplitude to determine the firing
efficiency (FE) versus level functions for the second pulse at a
range of interpulse intervals (IPIs).

where θ is the mean threshold current (i.e., corresponding to a
FE of 50%) and σ is the standard deviation in threshold fluctuations [16]. The FE versus level function for each model was
calculated for a single-pulse stimulus by running 1000 MonteCarlo simulations.
For the pulse-pair paradigm to test the refractory behavior,
the recovery of the threshold current (θ) for the second pulse as
a function of IPI was fit by

where θSP is the single-pulse (or unmasked) threshold current,
tabs is the absolute refractory period, and τ1 , τ2 , A1 , and A2
are, respectively, the time constants and strengths of two relative
refractory period components. This function is a generalization
of [4, (2)], which only had a single time-constant for the relative
refractory period, i.e., was equivalent to (3) above with A2 = 0.
We found that this extended equation with two components to
the relative refractory period provided better fits to some of the
simulation results.
The peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) is defined as the
number of spikes created within a certain time frame from
stimulus onset. PSTHs were computed from 100 repetitions
of Monte-Carlo simulation, where two categories of time bin
widths were defined [12]: 1) a “narrow bin” width of 1 ms;
and 2) a group of eight nonoverlapping “wide bin” windows.
These windows were 0–4, 4–12, 12–24, 24–36, 36–48, 48–100,
100–200, and 200–300 ms after pulse-train onset.
To analyze response rate adaptation [12], the response rate
as a function of stimulus current was investigated with a stimulus at a pulse rate of 2000 pulse/s. Three different response
epochs were specified. These epochs are denoted as in [12]: “onset” (0–1 ms); “rapid” (0–12 ms); and “short-term” or “steadystate” (200–300 ms). For more quantitative analysis on response
rate adaptation, two variables were computed [12]. These are,
spike rate decrement (SRD), which was calculated by subtracting the spike rate in the steady-state epoch (200–300 ms) from
that in the onset window (0–12 ms); and the normalized spike
rate decrement (NSRD), which was the SRD divided by the
onset response. Two regions of adaptation were defined [12]:

2752

“strong” (in gray) and “weak.” The strong adaptation areas in
each panel were bounded by arbitrarily defined slope values
between 0.75 and 1.0. It is worth noting that these strong adaptation boundaries were somewhat different from those defined
in [12], whereas they chose an area between 0.9 and 1.0.
III. RESULTS
A. Poststimulus Time Histograms
The PSTH results are shown in Fig. 2. The narrow bins are
represented by vertical bars and the wide bins with unfilled circles. The wide bins showed more accurately the trend of spike
rate over a long period of time than the narrow bins [12]. The four
model versions were stimulated at 200, 800, and 2000 pulse/s
(left, middle, and right columns, respectively) and stimulus level
at 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 firing probabilities (Fig. 2(a)–(c), respectively) to the first pulse. Comparisons are made based on equal
first-pulse FEs because the model variants have different threshold currents and dynamic ranges [46]. For these simulations, the
threshold currents (i.e., at FE = 0.5) for the four models (Standard HH, Ih alone added, IKLT alone added, and with both Ih
and IKLT added) are 54.29, 59.68, 57.36, and 62.70 pA, respectively. For an FE of 0.2, the respective stimulation levels
are 52.98, 57.10, 54.98, and 60.00 pA, while for an FE 0.8 they
are 55.59, 62.26, 59.75, and 65.40 pA.
Across all stimulus rates for the standard HH case, a flat
wide bins curve is observed indicating no adaptation, except at
the 2000 pulse/s (see Fig. 2(a), first row, right panel), where
the spike rate drops slightly. This could be attributed to the
low discharge probability and the refractory effect rather than
adaptation, as at higher stimulus levels the model maintains a
constant spike rate (Figs. 2(b) and (c), first row, right panel). The
model shows strong adaptation when the Ih is included [second
row, Figs. 2(a)–(c)] at higher stimulus rates, as indicated by the
exponential decay of the wide-bin curve. The drop in response
rate dominates even at higher discharge probabilities. Adding
IKLT only (third rows), causes the spike rate to drop at the first
few milliseconds (not as much as the Ih case) and remains at the
reduced level throughout the stimulation period. The inclusion
of both Ih and IKLT simultaneously (fourth rows) produces a
combined effect that exhibits the response of each channel when
added solely.
B. Response Rate Adaptation Analysis

represent stimulus levels at 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 firing probability to the first pulse.
Thin vertical bars represent histograms based on 1-ms bins, while open symbols represent wider bins. Histograms are obtained from 100 simulation trials. (a) First-pulse FE = 20%. (b) First-pulse FE = 50%. (c) First-pulse
FE = 80%.

The response rate was plotted as a function of stimulus current [12] for the four model versions, as shown in Fig. 3. The
onset response was influenced by refractory and discharge probability effects, preventing the spike rate to entrain to the stimulus rate. IKLT with (  ) or without () Ih showed lower
response rates at the onset and rapid epochs than the standard
HH model ( r) and when Ih is added alone (), when comparing
response rates at the same FE to the first pulse. This could be
an indication of rapid adaptation. Ih alone or with IKLT had
shallower slopes than the standard HH model and IKLT alone
for the steady-state epoch. The standard HH model showed no

difference in response rate between the rapid and short-term
epochs. These results suggested that Ih was responsible for
short-term adaptation. Results from Fig. 3 were comparable to
[12, Fig. 4, p. 361], where the “rapid” and “steady-state” epochs
responses were apart, with the “steady-state” response being the
lowest. Note that the stimulus pulse rate in Zhang et al. figure
was 5000 pulse/s.
Fig. 4 shows the SRDs (spike rate during 0–12 ms minus
spike rate during 200–300 ms) in the left column and NSRDs in
the right column as a function of onset response rate (spike rate
during 0–12 ms), for three stimulus pulse rates: 200, 800, and
2000 pulse/s (Fig. 4(a) and (b); Fig. 4(c) and (d); and Fig. 4(e)
and (f), respectively). In all pulse rate cases, the standard HH
model ( r) showed almost zero rate decrement, which could be
interpreted as weak or no adaptation. Adding Ih only () on the
other hand showed strong adaptation, which became stronger at
higher pulse rates. With inclusion of both Ih and IKLT (), the
response tended toward stronger adaptation, however, slightly
less than when Ih was added alone. IKLT alone () exhibited
stronger adaptation than the standard HH model, yet weaker than
the other two versions. These results were consistent with [12,
Fig. 5, p. 363], where SRDs became equal to onset response rate,
when the stimulus pulse rate was increased. Looking at panels
(b), (d), and (f), the normalized rate decrements became smaller
at higher onset spike rates that were greater than 200 spike/s,
consistent with [12] who suggested that this effect might result from greater stimulus levels that could partially overcome
adaptation.
To gain more insight into how the Ih channel produces the
slow drop in excitability, the model with Ih alone added was
subjected to a set of different stimulation and response scenarios,

Fig. 4. SRD (left column) and NSRD (right column) as a function of onset
response rate, for pulse rates of 200, 800, and 2000 pulse/s (a & b; c & d;
and e & f, respectively). The gray region indicates “strong adaptation” and is
arbitrarily chosen to be ≥ 0.75 of the normalized rate decrement. The model
versions are indicated by the figure legend.

as shown in Fig. 5. In all cases, the model was stimulated by
pulse trains at 2000 pulse/s with pulse width of 100 μs/phase
and no interphase gap for a duration of 20 ms (≡ 40 pulses).
The relatively short simulation duration (compared to the
300-ms PSTH simulations) is because short-term adaptation
in this model appears at about 15 ms after stimulus onset.
Fig. 5(a) shows the average relative membrane potential2 for
the last 100 μs of the interpulse gap, i.e., before the subsequent
pulse. Each point in each of the curves corresponds to the mean
of the averaged voltage for 50 Monte-Carlo simulation for that
particular stimulation-response scenario. Fig. 5(b) shows the
average fraction of open Ih channel gating particles (r̂) at the
corresponding times. Five specific stimulation-response conditions are defined: “zero current” (◦), “no spike” (), “first pulse”
(♦), “middle pulse” (), and “suprathreshold” (*).
In the “zero current” condition (◦), no stimulating current
was applied. It can be observed in Fig. 5 that for this scenario
there is minimal fluctuation in the average relative membrane
potential and the average fraction of open Ih channel gating
particles over the duration of the pulse train for the 50 MonteCarlo simulations. In the “no spike” case (), the stimulating
current amplitude for the pulse train was set to give a first-pulse
firing probability of 0.2, but only Monte-Carlo simulation trials

figure legend and described in the text) for the model with Ih added alone.

in which no spike was generated during the pulse train were
selected for computation of the mean interpulse membrane potential and gating particle value for the curves in Fig. 5. The
repetitive subthreshold responses in this situation cause a progressive drop in the fraction of open Ih channel gating particles
(see Fig. 5b), which in turn leads to a progressive drop in
the membrane potential between each stimulating pulse (see
Fig. 5a). Thus, the successive subthreshold responses move the
membrane potential further away from the threshold for action
potential generation, reducing excitability gradually.
In the “first pulse” case (♦), only Monte-Carlo trials were selected in which the first current pulse elicited an action potential
and there were no subsequent action potentials in response to
the rest of the pulse train. Again, the first pulse FE was 0.2. In
this situation, the action potential in response to the first pulse
causes a bigger initial drop in the fraction of open Ih channel
gating particles (see Fig. 5b) and in the interpulse membrane
potential (see Fig. 5a) than did the subthreshold first pulse
for the “no spike” case, but by the end of the 40 stimulating

pulses the average fraction of open r particles and the average
interpulse membrane potential have both converged for the two
cases. In the “middle pulse” case (◦), once again the first pulse
FE was 0.2, but trials were selected in which one action potential was generated in response to the 20th pulse in the train and
no other action potentials were generated for that pulse train.
In such trials, it can be observed that the response to the first
ten pulses or so is very similar on average to the “no spike”
trials (see Fig. 5b). However, in trials where a spike occurs in
the middle of the pulse train, the random fluctuations of the Ih
channel gating particles happen to return the fraction of open
Ih channels (see Fig. 5b) and subsequently the interpulse membrane potential (see Fig. 5a) back toward their resting values,
such that the neural excitability is closer to its resting state. This
result illustrates the importance of utilizing a stochastic model
when studying “subthreshold” membrane phenomena.
For the “suprathreshold” condition (*), a stimulating current
level was chosen to give a 0.999 firing probability to the first
pulse, such that the vast majority of the pulses would elicit action potentials if not for the temporal interactions from the pulse
train. In this situation, the fraction of open Ih channel gating
particles drops at a greater rate than is observed for the “no
spike” or “first pulse” conditions (see Fig. 5b), indicating that
the larger subthreshold responses from the larger stimulating
current and the larger depolarizations from the occasional spiking cause a more rapid drop in excitability than do the smaller
subthreshold responses from the “no spike” or “first pulse” conditions. The interpulse membrane potential is initially high for
the “suprathreshold” case (see Fig. 5a) because of the more
frequent spiking at the start of the pulse train, but the interpulse
membrane potential drops substantially as the Ih channels close
up later in the pulse train and the spike rate drops dramatically. Some alternation in the interpulse membrane potential is
also observed at the start of the pulse train because refractoriness makes the neural model more likely to spike in response
to pulses 1 and 3 than to pulses 2 and 4, and the interpulse
membrane potential is high during an action potential (also seen
where a spike is generated in the “first pulse” and “middle pulse”
conditions).

and normalized by the single-pulse threshold current, as a function of the IPI. The symbols used to plot the results for the
different model versions are indicated by the legend. The solid
lines are fits to these curves using (3), and the parameters for
these fits are given in Table II.
The addition of the Ih channel () to the HH model ( r)
increases the initial relative refractory period without changing
the absolute refractory period or the slower component of the
relative refractory recovery. In contrast, adding IKLT () to the
HH model increases the absolute refractory period and both
the fast and slow components of relative refractory period. This
increased period of refractoriness occurs during a period of

afterhyperpolarization that does not occur for the standard HH
model. Including both channel types in the model () produces
a synergistic increase of the absolute refractory period, while
the slower component of the relative refractory period remains
dominated by the IKLT channel.
Care must be taken in comparing time constants for the relative refractory period components in Tables II and III because
the effect of the component is also determined by the relative
magnitude of that component.

The results of an analysis of the sensitivity of the simulation
results to the number of HCN and KLT channels are given in
Table III. Simulations were performed with zero, half, and double the default number of HCN and KLT channels (given in
Table I). In order to capture the effect of channel number on
adaptation in the PSTH in a single value, the mean normalized
spike rate decrement (MNSRD) was calculated across the three
different first-pulse firing efficiencies (FE = 20%, 50%, and
80%). The effect of channel number on the refractory function
fits was also explored. This analysis shows a general trend of an
increased strength of adaptation and refractoriness with larger
numbers of HCN and KLT channels. However, even with half
the default number of channels (indicated by ×1/2 in Table III),
the versions of the model with the additional channels show a
marked qualitative difference to the standard HH model (indicated by ×0 in Table III). This suggests that it is not necessary
for a node of Ranvier to have very large numbers of KLT or
HCN channels to produce a functional change in the temporal
interactions exhibited at that node.
IV. DISCUSSION
The simulation results shown in this paper demonstrate that
HCN and KLT channels could have substantial effects on the
temporal response properties of ANFs to electrical pulse trains
from CIs. The Ih current carried by the HCN channels appears
to produce slow adaptation to an ongoing pulse train, while
the IKLT generated by the KLT channels has a faster effect
(see Figs. 2–4). The strength of the adaptation, as quantified
in the normalized rate decrements shown in Fig. 4, appears to
be slightly stronger for Ih than IKLT . However, because of the
faster rate of adaptation and longer refractoriness (see Fig. 6)
caused by IKLT , the rate calculated in this metric may already
be reduced within the onset response window, leading to an underestimation of the strength of adaptation produced by IKLT .
The analysis shown in Fig. 5 indicates that the gradual drop
in excitability of a model with Ih for a high-rate pulse train
is due not only to spike-rate adaptation but also to subthreshold responses (i.e., pulses that do not elicit an action potential).
Such behavior has been referred to in the CI literature as desensitization [8] or subthreshold masking [10], but the historical
terminology is accommodation [51], [52]. All of the simulations
reported in this paper were conducted with a stochastic model.
The effect of HCN and KLT channels on the refractory recovery
are fundamentally the same if simulated using equivalent deterministic models. Dynamic instability in a deterministic neural
model has been shown to produce irregular firing for very high
rates of stimulation [53], but the equivalent deterministic models of those used in the present study do not exhibit adaptation
or accommodation that is consistent with the physiological data
across the appropriate pulse rates and current levels.
An alternative mechanism for adaptation and accommodation based on extracellular potassium accumulation has been
proposed by Woo et al. [10], [26]–[28]. Accommodation could
only be generated in their model if it included a KLT channel
[10]. However, they could not determine a set of ion channel

2756

densities that could simultaneously explain the physiological
data for rate adaptation, adaptation recovery, and refractory periods [10]. Based on the results of this present study, inclusion
of an Ih model might be required to properly explain all the
contributing factors to refractoriness, adaptation, and accommodation. In addition, Miller et al. utilized an IKLT model incorporating only a single activation particle and no inactivation
[10] that was based on channels in nonauditory neurons, following [25]. However, the IKLT properties of SGNs [32], [33]
appear to be closer to those of VCN cells [41], [44], [45] and
MSO neurons [39], motivating our use of the channel model
from [36] with fourth-order activation kinetics and partial inactivation.
Inclusion of Ih and IKLT was found to systematically change
refractory properties of model ANFs (se Fig. 6). Variation in
HCN and KLT channel densities at different nodes of Ranvier
may, therefore, explain the variability observed in refractory
properties of cat ANFs [3], [4]. However, the model developed
in this study is unable to predict the extension of relative refractoriness out to at least 4 ms in a subpopulation of ANFs that
is observed in the cat and human physiological data [3], [4],
[6], [7]. Our sensitivity analysis only considered the effects of
the number of channels. Other parameters such as nodal geometry, single-channel conductances, and activation/inactivation
dynamics may also influence the refractory and adaptation properties. In particular, there is a fair degree of heterogeneity in
the activation and inactivation characteristics of HCN [30] and
KLT [44], [45] channels. It is also possible that yet further ion
channels with slow dynamics, beyond HCN and KLT, are contributing to refractory and adaptation properties at these longer
time periods. A multiplicity of contributing ion channels with a
large range of time constants can give rise to “power-law adaptation” [54], which has been found to be important in modeling
the response of ANFs to acoustic stimulation [55], [56].
There may also be species differences in the ion channels expressed in ANFs, such as the persistent sodium channel that has
been incorporated into a model of human ANFs [57]–[59]. It is
not yet known whether a persistent sodium channel exists in the
ANFs of other species such as cat. In this paper, we have used
a single-node model in order to separate out the effects of the
HCN and KLT channels from other factors that could influence
the temporal response properties, such as the neural morphology and the electrode–neuron geometry [23], [28]. The neural
morphology is known to vary across species as well, motivating
the development of species-specific compartmental models of
entire ANFs, where possible [20], [57]–[61]. In all cases, the
particular locations of different voltage-gate ion channels, including HCN and KLT, along the ANFs should be taken into
consideration [34], [62].

The equations for the Nav and Kv channels were already
appropriate for the desired AN node of Ranvier temperature
