Abstract—We present an encapsulation scheme that combines
atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al2 O3 and Parylene C for the encapsulation of implantable devices. The encapsulation performances
of combining alumina and Parylene C was compared to individual
layers of Parylene C or alumina and the bilayer coating had superior encapsulation properties. The alumina–Parylene coated interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) soaked in PBS for up to nine months at
temperatures from 37 to 80 ◦ C for accelerated lifetime testing. For
52-nm alumina and 6-μm Parylene C, leakage current was ∼20 pA
at 5 VDC, and the impedance was about 3.5 MΩ at 1 kHz with a
phase near −87◦ from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
for samples soaked at 67 ◦ C for equivalent lifetime of 72 months
at 37 ◦ C. The change of impedance during the whole soaking period (up to 70 months of equivalent soaking time at 37 ◦ C) over 1 to
106 Hz was within 5%. The stability of impedance indicated almost
no degradation of the encapsulation. Bias voltage effect was studied by continuously applying 5 VDC, and it reduced the lifetime of
Parylene coating by ∼75% while it showed no measurable effect
on the bilayer coating. Lifetime of encapsulation of IDEs with topography generated by attaching a coil and surface mount device
(SMD) capacitor was about half of that of planer IDEs. The stable
long-term insulation impedance, low leakage current, and better
lifetime under bias voltage and topography made this double-layer
encapsulation very promising for chronic implantable devices.

I. INTRODUCTION
LECTRONIC biomedical implantable devices have been
widely developed and commercialized for different applications, such as pacemakers, cochlear implants, and deep brain
stimulators. The commercially available implants typically use
hermetically packaging in laser-welded enclosures [1]. Device
miniaturization, required for many applications, makes hermetic
encapsulation a very challenging solution. Hermetic encapsulation based on cans and microlids take more space than thin-filmbased coating solutions and it can also potentially interfere with
telecommunication for wireless systems. Implantable sensing
and therapeutic devices require interaction with physiological
environment by using fully exposed microfabricated active regions, for drug delivery, neuroprosthetics, etc. [2]. Longevity,
long-term stability and functionality of the implantable electronic systems, relying on the encapsulation performance, are
very critical to reduce the surgical risks from follow-up surgeries
and generate the level of efficacy that justifies the risks associated with the implants. We are developing neural interfaces for
neural stimulation and recording based on Utah electrode array
(UEA) [3] that incorporate active electronics, and are targeting lifetimes of 70 years, requiring these electrode arrays to be
protected from the physiological environment of the body.
The electrical insulation performance, and its change overtime, is one of the main metrics to measure the effectiveness of
the encapsulation. A high impedance encapsulation is critical
to achieving separation between channels, and achieving good
selectivity for neural interfaces. The change of the impedance
reflects the degradation of the encapsulation, and can be precisely monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) [4]. The encapsulation has to be biocompatible, conformal, highly resistive, and have a low dielectric constant [5].
Inorganic materials, such as silicon nitride and silicon carbide,
have been used for encapsulation because of their corrosion resistance and low permeability to water, oxygen, and ions. But
they tend to have high deposition temperature, which may not be
compatible with implantable devices with active electronics and
polymer materials. Silicon nitride slowly dissolves in vivo [6],
[7], and silicon carbide tends to have relative poor conformality
when deposited using low-temperature plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) [8]. Polymer encapsulation is
attractive due to their potential for flexibility, biocompatibility,
high impedance, low dielectric constant, and low deposition
temperature.

Parylene C has been commonly employed as encapsulation
material for implantable devices [9]–[11] because of its many
of attractive properties. It is chemically inert and has low dielectric constant (εr = 3.15) [12]. It has low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of 0.2 (g·mm)/(m2 ·day) [13], high resistivity
(∼1015 Ω·cm) and has a USP class VI biocompatibility [14].
Another attractive characteristic is the ability to deposit conformal and pin-hole free films at room temperature. Parylene
C is also an excellent ion barrier [15], which is very important
for implants exposed to physiological environment. This is also
likely to prevent or reduce corrosion since often ions have to be
transported during the corrosion reactions. Failure of Parylene
C coating has been reported [16] due to moisture permeation
and is dramatically exacerbated by interface contamination. Another well-known issue with Parylene C is it has poor adhesion
to inorganic and metal substrate materials [17]–[19]. A couple
of techniques have been developed to improve the adhesion.
Methane plasma treatments have been used to improve the adhesion by creating radical sites for covalent bonding [20]. Heat
treatments were also found to be useful for improving adhesion
by annealing the polymer and improving mechanical interlock
adhesion with the substrate [21], [22]. Reactive Parylene was
also found to increase the adhesion by introducing additional
functional groups other than Cl to form chemical bonds with
the substrates [10].
Moisture condensation on contaminants at the interface can
also cause delamination of Parylene films. The failure mode can
be minimized by decreasing moisture transport to the interface
between the coating and the device, and controlling the interface
contamination and chemistry to suppress the nucleation of liquid water. Most polymers can provide WVRT in the range of 1–
10 g/m2 ·day, and traditional water barriers such as Al and silicon
oxide have WVTR of 0.1–0.001 g/m2 ·day, which cannot provide
good enough protection from moisture for organic electronic devices requiring WVTR of 10−6 g/m2 ·day [23]. Al2 O3 films deposited by atomic layer deposited (ALD) has been demonstrated
as an excellent moisture barrier with WVTR at the order of
∼10−10 (g·mm)/(m2 ·day) [24]–[27], for preventing the degradation of extremely moisture-sensitive organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs). The biocompatibility of Al2 O3 is comparable
to that of corrosion resistant metals like titanium [28]. Finch
et al. [29] reported that ALD alumina-coated glass slides had
very similar level of biocompatibility compared with uncoated
glass slides. Also bulk alumina is used as substrate for floating
microelectrode arrays for neural recording, suggesting it is reasonable for use with neural tissue, at least if encapsulated [30].
ALD Al2 O3 is superior compared with films generated by other
deposition techniques such as sputtered Al2 O3 in terms of moisture barrier [24], [31] because it is denser and pin-hole free.
Liquid water is known to slowly corrode Al2 O3 thin films [32],
mostly likely due to the incorporation of hydrogen in the form
of OH groups in the film [33], [34]; therefore, Al2 O3 alone is
not suitable for encapsulation of biomedical implants directly
exposed to physiological environment. The idea of combining
Al2 O3 and Parylene C is based on the concept that Al2 O3 works
as an inner moisture barrier and Parylene works as an external
ion barrier, preventing contact of Al2 O3 with liquid water, and
slowing the kinetics of alumina corrosion.

fabricated IDEs on quartz substrate.

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Interdigitated Electrodes Fabrication
Interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) are widely used as test structures for evaluating coating performance because of their high
sensitivity to the degradation of coating [10], [19], [35]. Electrode traces and spaces are 130 μm wide and 2.5 mm in
length, and there are 11 pairs of electrodes in total on fused
silica substrates. Standard liftoff lithographic techniques were
used to pattern the as-deposited metals. LOR 7B (MicroChem
Corp.) and 1813 (Shipley) were spun on 500-μm-thick fused
silica substrates to pattern the later deposited metal. Ti/Pt/Au
(100/150/150 nm) were sputtered using a T-M Vacuum sputter
system. The resist was removed with acetone and Shipley developer 352 after metal deposition to get the desired pattern [see
Fig. 1(A1)]. The IDEs were then annealed at 375 ◦ C informing
gas (Ar:H2 98%:2%) for 45 min in a Linberg furnace. Finally,
the fused silica wafer was diced and singlated into individual
samples using Disco DAD3220 [see Fig. 1(b)].
B. Al2 O3 and Parylene C Deposition
After singlation, the IDEs were soldered with wires for later
electrical measurement and cleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionized (DI) water, ready for coating. Al2 O3
was deposited by sequentially exposing IDEs to trimethylaluminum (TMA) vapor and oxygen plasma for 500 cycles
at 120 ◦ C using Fiji F200 [Cambridge NanoTech Inc.; see
Fig. 1(A2)]. Each plasma-assisted (PA)-ALD cycle consisted
of a 0.06 s TMA pulse, 10 s argon purge, 20 s O2 plasma exposure with flow rate of 20 sccm at 300 W RF power, and a 5 s
argon purge at 0.3 mTorr. Compared to thermal ALD processes,

were conducted using a two-electrode configuration by connecting the working
sensing to working and counter to reference electrodes, respectively. Wirewound gold coils were wire bonded and fixed with silicone to some of the
samples to create topography.

PA-ALD process was preferred for its lower deposition temperature and shorter purge time by using reactive oxygen species
as oxidizer instead of water. Also, PA-ALD process reduces
hydrogen incorporation in Al2 O3 films compared with same
temperature thermal ALD process [36], [37], thus improve the
film quality in terms of leakage current [37], [38].
Following the alumina coating, the IDEs were silanized with
silane A-174 (Momentive Performance Materials) vapor to improve the adhesion between Al2 O3 and Parylene C layer. Then,
6 μm of Parylene C was deposited by standard Gorham process [12] in a LabTop 3000 Parylene coater (Para Tech Coating), using DPX-C dimer (Specialty Coating Systems) [see
Fig. 1(A3)].
C. Soaking Test Setup
The soaking tests were performed in digitally controlled water baths (HH-4, C and A Scientific) at temperatures from 37
to 80 ◦ C. The water baths use a magnetic stirrer for temperature uniformity, and have a temperature precision of ±0.5 ◦ C.
The 6 mL sample vials containing the test structures immersed
in saline were supported in the temperature controlled water
bath using an acrylic holder (Fig. 2). The IDEs were submerged
during the experiment. The sample vials were filled with 1×
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the solution was changed
every two weeks to minimize the sodium concentration variation due to water evaporation. The PBS had composition of
0.0027 M KCl and 0.0137 M NaCl with pH of 7.4. Multiple
water baths were used to soak samples at 37, 57, 67, and 80 ◦ C,
respectively. In order to investigate the effect of bias voltage on
coating performance, active soaking was performed by applying
5 VDC bias to one terminal of the IDEs. The effect of topography on the encapsulation performance was also studied by
adding an extra wire-wound gold coil (see Fig.11) and an SMD
capacitor on top of flat IDE test structure (see Fig. 2) to simulate
the complex geometries of the real implantable devices. Gold
coils were wired bonded and SMD capacitors were soldered

to the IDEs and they were not part of the circuit for electrical
measurement. IDEs without gold coil and capacitor were used
as control samples to determine the effects of the additional
topography.
D. Impedance and Leakage Current Measurement
EIS has been widely used to evaluate the longevity and degradation of both organic and inorganic coatings [4], [39], [40]. All
the EIS and chronoamperometry experiments were carried out
using a Reference 600 potentiostat (Gamry Instruments). During EIS measurement, a sine wave of 50 mV was applied from
1 Hz to 1 MHz and 10 data points per decade (3 replicates
for each data point) were obtained. A two-electrode configuration was realized by connecting working to working sense
electrode and counter to reference electrode, respectively. The
5 VDC (sourced by using the Gamry) leakage current is used
to diagnose the integrity of the coating (including pin holes and
acceleration of electrochemical corrosion mechanisms) using
chronoamperometry. The Reference 600 was calibrated every
month to make sure the measurement accuracy.
III. RESULTS
A. ALD Alumina Characterization
The Al2 O3 film thickness was about 52 nm and the deposition
rate was about 1.04 Å/cycle, which is typical for ALD process
[41]. AFM micrographs (Fig. 3) show the surface roughness
(Rrm s ) increases from 0.17 to 0.48 nm for the bare substrate
and ALD film, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was used to analyze the composition of Al2 O3 films. The
O/Al ratio of as-deposited Al2 O3 films was 1.41, which was
close to stoichiometric value of 1.5, comparing with O/Al ratio
of over 2 reported elsewhere [24], [42] when O3 was used as
oxidizer. Also, no Ar was detected in the film.
B. Impedance at 37 ◦ C (Body Temperature) Over Time
The impedance was first measured in air before soaking for
all samples with different coatings: Al2 O3 , Parylene C, and
Al2 O3 + Parylene C. The phase is near −90◦ for all types

constant for the duration of the soaking.

of samples, indicating the expected purely capacitive behavior. The measurement results were fitted into a simple constant
phase element (CPE) equivalent circuit model based on the relative constant phase, as shown in Fig. 4. Capacitance of the
dry IDEs was about 4.5 pF, and it increased to 51 pF after
immersion in PBS. Following the impedance measurement in
air, samples were submerged in 1× PBS at 37 ◦ C for about
nine months, and impedance spectroscopy was performed every week. The impedance and phase are shown in Fig. 5 as a
function of time. The impedance declined about one order of
magnitude and the phase shifted from −90◦ to −88◦ almost immediately after sample immersion in PBS. During the 260-day
soaking testing, impedance remained nearly unchanged, phase
remained relatively constant at higher frequencies (>10 Hz) and
a slight increase of phase was observed (from −88◦ to −86◦ )
for the frequencies of 1–10 Hz.
C. Accelerated Lifetime Testing
Accelerated lifetime testing was performed at different temperatures to speed up the validation process for the encapsulation scheme which usually takes years [9]. Body temperature
(37 ◦ C) was used as the baseline temperature and accelerated
aging factors are calculated as shown in Table I based on a
doubling reaction rate for each 10 ◦ C increase in reaction temperature [43], [44]. The impedance stayed unchanged during
the whole period for samples soaked at 37, 57, 67, and 80 ◦ C
compared with impedance at the first day of soak testing, shown

coating at 37 ◦ C and elevated temperature for accelerated testing in PBS. The
impedance is denoted by Z and the phase is denoted by P in the legend. All the
samples are still under testing.

in Fig. 6. The phase remained close to −90◦ after nine months of
soak testing for samples at 37, 57, and 67 ◦ C. A slight increase
of phase was observed for samples at 80 ◦ C, indicating initial
degradation of the encapsulation.
The equivalent soaking time was calculated by multiplying
the real soaking time with the corresponding accelerated aging
factor at that specific temperature, shown in Table I. Based on
this estimation, the samples soaked at 80 ◦ C are almost equivalent to ten years at 37 ◦ C. It is well known that temperature
higher than 57 ◦ C could introduce new failure modes that do
not exist during normal aging processes at 37 ◦ C. However, this
measurement is useful as a worst-case scenario, since activation of additional failure modes would likely only decease the
lifetime of devices.
D. Impedance at 1 kHz
Impedance at 1 kHz is very important for a lot of applications,
such as neural recording and stimulation, because action potentials are centered around frequencies of 1 kHz. The impedance
was about 36 MΩ for all samples in air; it dropped to around
3.5 MΩ after the first day of soak testing in PBS and remained
unchanged for the remaining nine-month testing period as can
be observed from the data in Fig. 7. This is about one order
of magnitude higher than Hsu et al. [9] (with the same geometry) by using Parylene C as encapsulation layer and also
higher than Hsu et al. [8] reported using a-SiCx :H encapsulation, most likely due to the contribution from the alumina layer.
Further analysis will be performed in Section IV. No measurable

different temperatures: alumina only, Parylene only, and alumina + Parylene C.
Alumina and Parylene coating has the best insulation performance.

Fig. 6. For Parylene-coated IDEs, leakage current reached over
1 nA (defined as coating failure) after five months of soak testing
at 57 ◦ C. IDEs soaked at higher temperature failed earlier due
to the temperature effect. Leakage current was in milliamperes
level within two days for alumina coating (not shown in Fig. 8).
It is noticed that IDEs soaked at higher temperature failed earlier
(for Parylene coating) or had higher leakage (for alumina and
Parylene coating) after same period of soaking time, due to the
temperature aging effect. The extremely low leakage current
(≤20 pA) was excellent for IDEs with alumina and Parylene
coating that have soaked under accelerated conditions for six
years of equivalent soaking time at 37 ◦ C with 5 VDC continuous bias.

260-day test period. “Day 0” means samples were in air before soaking test.
Higher temperature is prone to have higher leakage current as expected. Also
Parylene-coated samples have much higher leakage current compared with alumina and Parylene coating at the same time period for accelerated lifetime
testing.

difference was observed between samples soaking at different
temperatures.
E. Leakage Current
Leakage current is another very important metric to quantitatively measure the performance of the encapsulation. Leakage
current was measured by applying a 5 VDC bias between the
two terminals of the IDEs. Fig. 8 shows the leakage current for
IDEs as a function of time, soaking temperature, and encapsulation of Parylene, and alumina with Parylene bilayers. For
alumina- and Parylene-coated IDEs, the leakage current was
about 1 pA while sample was in air prior to soaking. Then, it increased immediately to around 15 pA after immersion in PBS,
due to a shorter effective distance for dc resistance, which is
explained further in Section IV. The leakage current remained
∼15 pA during the 260-day soaking period for samples at 37,
57, and 67 ◦ C. For samples at 80 ◦ C, the leakage current started
to increase at a rate of roughly ∼3 pA/day after 150 days of
soaking and reached 100 pA after 180 days. This is consistent
with the increase of phase angle at low frequency observed in

F. Encapsulation Scheme Comparison
The accelerated soak test performance of the three different encapsulation schemes, including alumina only, Parylene C
only, and alumina and Parylene C were compared. The
impedance spectroscopy data collected as a function of time
from these samples is presented in Fig. 9. For the alumina-coated
samples, the impedance dropped enormously and the phase
increased dramatically for the whole frequency range (1 Hz–
1 MHz) after two days of soaking at 37 ◦ C and the leakage current reached even the milliampere level with in two days, indicating a rapid and catastrophic failure. The impedance decreased
about one order of magnitude for Parylene-C-coated samples
and phase deviated from −90◦ and increased dramatically even
after a relative shorter soaking period of time especially at
lower frequencies (<100 Hz) during the accelerated lifetime
testing (57, 67, and 80 ◦ C). As the soaking time increases, the
impedance kept decreasing even for higher frequency range until it reaches to the impedance of the PBS. The decrease in
impedance and increase in phase angle and leakage current (see
Fig. 8) indicate a steady failure of Parylene encapsulation. The
impedance and phase angle for the alumina- and Parylene-Ccoated samples at 1 kHz remained unchanged after the soaking for all different temperatures, with values near 3.6 MΩ
and −88◦ , respectively. The double-layer encapsulation maintained a leakage current of less than 20 pA for all temperatures

(except 80 ◦ C) and time points, which is considerably better than
Parylene coating.

were added to the surface of the test structures. The alumina
and Parylene encapsulation endured about five months at 57 ◦ C.
This is shorter than the lifetime of samples without coils that
soaked at 57 ◦ C (nine months up to date), as shown in Fig. 11.
Parylene-only coated samples with coils and capacitors were
also tested, and they lasted about one month (encapsulation
failed when leakage current was constantly higher than 1 nA),
which also showed that the complex topography had critical
negative impact on encapsulation lifetime.

G. Effect of Al2 O3 Thickness
The thickness of the ALD Al2 O3 used as part of the bilayer
encapsulation was varied with values of 18, 32, 52, and 70 nm.
For coatings of alumina ≥32 nm and 6 μm Parylene, no changes
in the impedance and leakage current were observed at 57 ◦ C
(up to date) for nine months of the trial to date. Samples coated
with 18 nm alumina and 6 μm Parylene failed within two days of
soak testing, as shown in Fig. 10. This lasted even significantly
shorter than Parylene-only coated samples.
H. Effect of Bias
Implantable devices with active electronics require power.
Depending on the voltage and current characteristics, the voltage and current from the power supply can generate an additional factor affecting the encapsulation, which is different than
aging mechanism such as electrochemistry and temperature effects [45], [46]. This power can contribute to the electrochemical reactions, corrosion, and degradation modes, move ions, perform electrolysis of water, etc. Alumina, Parylene, and alumina–
Parylene bilayer coated samples were tested under continuous
5 VDC bias in PBS. For alumina and Parylene C coating, samples under continuous 5 V bias lasted almost nine months at
57 ◦ C (up to date). However, Parylene C only samples under
those conditions lasted only about 50 days, which was only
about one third of lifetime of those without dc bias (about
150 days). This suggested that continuous bias voltage accelerated the failure process of the Parylene-coated samples, while it
had significantly less effect on the alumina and Parylene bilayer
samples.
I. Effect of Topography
The soak test results presented thus far were performed with
planar IDE test structures, which is a significant difference from
the complex structure of actual neural interface devices. In order to begin testing the effects of topography on encapsulation
performance, wire-wound gold coils and SMD capacitors [47]

IV. DISCUSSION
The bilayer encapsulation had leakage current of about 15 pA
and impedance of 3.5 MΩ at 1 kHz after equivalent soak time
of about six years at 37 ◦ C. Bias voltage of 5 VDC did not affect
the bi-layer encapsulation performance. The excellent soaking
performance of the alumina and Parylene coating is ascribed
to that Parylene is a good ion barrier with a low but finite
water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) (0.2 (g·mm)/(m2 ·day)
[13]), and alumina acts as a water barrier (WVTR of 10-10
gmm/m2 ·day [24]–[27]). Failure of Parylene C encapsulation
is mainly caused by water penetration and nucleation around
surface contaminants [16]. Alumina is an excellent moisture
barrier, while it can be corroded when directly exposed to liquid
water [48]. Therefore, the order of placing Parylene on top of
alumina has been determined by their individual functionalities.
The impedance dropped one order of magnitude immediately
after submerging alumina- and Parylene-coated samples in PBS.
This initial impedance drop could be partially explained by the
change of the environmentally media from air to PBS [49]. The
permittivity of PBS solution is 80 [50], which is much higher
than that of air (εr = 1), resulting in higher capacitance of the
IDE structure, and the concomitant decrease in impedance. Also,
permeation of water through the Parylene C could increase the
capacitance due to higher permittivity. This increase of capacitance could also contribute to the drop of the impedance. This
is also consistent with the relatively constant phase observed,
because a change in capacitance would change the impedance,
but the phase would remain close to −90◦ . Similar impedance
drop was found when samples were soaked in DI water, which

effective distance for dc resistance in air is 130 μm and in PBS solution it is
12 μm with highly conductive PBS.

strongly suggested that conductivity of the ambient media did
not have significant impact on the impedance change.
Accelerated lifetime tests were performed for alumina and
Parylene bilayer samples in order to speed up the evaluation
process for this encapsulation method. Those tests were also
designed to determine the degradation characteristics of the encapsulation. No obvious difference has been observed for all
samples that were soaked at different temperatures in terms of
impedance and phase. It is possible that the major shift was below 1 Hz, and we were not able to observe it yet since impedance
was not measured for frequencies lower than 1 Hz. Because of
this, the accelerated lifetime is not able to resolve the characteristics of the encapsulation degradation at this time, and determine if they have an Arrhenius character. This also suggests
that samples are far from failure. The continued performance
for the bilayer for beyond 2000 days (37 ◦ C equivalent) at 67 ◦ C
indicated the strong reliability of this bilayer coating for planar
test structures.
Fused silica substrates were used in order to eliminate capacitive paths through conductive substrates to improve sensitivity
for measuring films with very high impedance [51]. The leakage
current increased from 1 to 15 pA when samples were immersed
into PBS from air. This initial leakage current is mainly because
of the dc resistance drop. When IDEs are in air, the effective
distance for dc resistance is about the spacing between two adjacent electrodes, which is 130 μm. After being immersed into
PBS, the effective distance becomes the thickness of two 50-nm
alumina layers, two 6-μm Parylene layers linked by the conductive PBS, which is about 12 μm of encapsulation, as shown
in Fig. 12. Therefore, the effective distance for dc resistance
decreased about ten times, which leads to the drastic increase of
the leakage current.
The direct exposure of alumina only coated samples to PBS
led immediately failure. The direct contact with water led to
the dissolution of the alumina [32]. It has been reported that
corrosion protection by using alumina only lasted hours in PBS
solution [48], [52]. Another main factor is that the stress of bias
voltage for impedance and leakage current measurement speeds
up the dissolution of alumina, and thus, the failure of the coating.
With regard to the short lifetime of <2 days for the 18 nm alumina and 6 μm Parylene coating, we believe this resulted from
the 5 VDC bias for leakage current measurement exceeding the
breakdown voltage of the alumina film. The breakdown voltage (electrical breakdown strength: ∼3.7 MV/cm [36], [53]) is

∼6.5 V for 18 nm alumina and ∼10 V for 32 nm alumina. These
samples with 18 nm of alumina coating failed even more quickly
than just Parylene films of equivalent thickness. We believe the
breakdown of alumina films creates ions and mechanical damage at the interface between the substrate and Parylene layer.
For 52 nm alumina coating, the breakdown voltage would be
∼18 V, which is sufficient for most implantable devices with
good tolerances.
Testing Parylene films with continuous bias voltage and accelerated temperatures had a significant effect on their performance, whereas we have not been had failure sufficient to determine a lifetime for ALD alumina (>30 nm) and Parylenecoated samples. For alumina (> 30 nm) and Parylene coating,
the alumina layer prevented the moisture from permeating to the
interface between the alumina and substrate where bias voltage
was applied. This limits low resistance pathways that support
electrochemical corrosion and degradation process. Therefore,
bias voltage has very limited or even no effect on the aluminaand Parylene-coated samples. For Parylene-C-coated samples,
due to the existence of moisture and possible contamination at
the interface between the substrate and coating layer, the bias
voltage can accelerate the mobility of contaminants (especially
ions) surrounded by nucleated water and expedite the failure
process of the Parylene coating. There are a couple of models
that have been proposed for predicting the time to failure for
the effects of bias voltage on lifetime [45]. The power rule for
voltage model is a simplified Eyring model, which states voltage
dependency of time to failure:
tf = AV −β
where tf is time to failure, A is a constant, V is the voltage,
and β is the voltage stress factor. A 5 VDC bias decreased the
lifetime by ∼75% and this gives us an estimation of β to be
0.86. More experiments need to be done to study the effect of
bias voltage statistically and quantitatively.
The presence of wire-wound gold coils and SMD capacitors introduced complex topography and therefore resulted in
significantly shortened lifetimes for the encapsulation. Complex geometries could affect the conformity and uniformity of
the chemical vapor deposited films. The thickness variation of
Parylene may result in some weak points of the encapsulation.
Due to the surface roughness, sites with extruded particles are
vulnerable to voltage bias and handling stress. Thicker Parylene
layer would alleviate this problem. The conformity and uniformity of the self-limiting ALD process will not be affected since
it has been demonstrated to be extremely conformal even for
very high aspect ratio (up to 1000) structures [54]. Also, handing stress for the complex geometries could contribute to the
relative short lifetime of the coating. Micromotions between the
coil and the substrate could shorten the lifetime of the bilayer
encapsulation as well.
V. CONCLUSION
In summary, we have demonstrated the excellent insulation
performance for the combination of PA-ALD Al2 O3 and Parylene C for IDEs and its potential suitability as a near-hermetic

encapsulation for implantable devices. EIS and chronoamperometry were used to evaluate the integrity and insulation performance of the alumina and Parylene bilayer encapsulation.
Impedance was ∼3.5 MΩ at 1 kHz with phase of close to −87◦
by using EIS for samples under 67 ◦ C about nine months (approximately equivalent to 72 months at 37 ◦ C), indicating no
significant degradation. The leakage current was ∼20 pA by applying 5 VDC bias. The encapsulation performances of alumina
only, Parylene C only, and alumina and Parylene C coatings were
compared and the bilayer coating demonstrated the highest performance of at least five times longer lifetime than the other
two coating approaches. Alumina-coated samples had leakage
current higher than 1 mA within two days at 37 ◦ C and Parylenecoated samples have leakage current higher than 1 μA with
60-day soak testing at 67 ◦ C. Using 5 VDC bias, no increases
in leakage current and drop in insulating impedance were observed for alumina- and Parylene-coated samples at 57 ◦ C for
nine months so far, while it shortened the lifetime of Parylene
coating by factor of ∼3 (∼50 days with bias VS ∼150 days without bias at 57 ◦ C). The lifetime of alumina- and Parylene-coated
devices with wire-wound coils and SMD capacitors was about
50% or less of that of planar test structures. The mechanism
and possible methods to mitigate the failure modes associated
with topography and electric breakdown of alumina are being
investigated. The long-term (more than six years of equivalent
lifetime) insulation performance of the double-layer encapsulation shows its potential usefulness for chronic implantable
electronic microsystems.
