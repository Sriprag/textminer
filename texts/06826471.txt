With Fractional-Order Features

Abstract—The residual stenosis estimation of an arteriovenous
shunt is a valuable for evaluating outcomes of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) treatment and surgical revision. This
paper proposes a dual-channel phonoangiography (PCG) with
fractional-order features to estimate the residual of stenosis estimation of arteriovenous shunt. The auscultation technique provides a noninvasive tool to monitor the degrees of arteriovenous
grafts (AVGs). Then, support methods, such as the Burg autoregressive (AR) method and self-synchronization error formulation (SSEF), are used to extract fractional-order features between
the loop site (L-site) and venous anastomosis site (V-site). Using
2-D patterns (nonlinear mapping), a generalized regression neural
network (GRNN) is designed as a nonlinear estimate model to indicate the outcome of surgical revision or AVG stenosis upon routine
monthly examinations. For 42 long-term follow-up patients, the
results of examination show the proposed GRNN-based screening
model efficiently estimates residual stenosis.
Index Terms—Arteriovenous graft (AVG), fractional-order feature, generalized regression neural network (GRNN), phonoangiography (PCG).

I. INTRODUCTION
RTERIOVENOUS shunts (AVS) are vital for end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) for patients receiving hemodialysis
therapy. The bridge accesses of AVS are anastomosed between
arteries and veins, including Brescia-Cimino arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) or synthetic loop grafts (AVGs) made of politetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) for hemodialysis [1], [2]. Due to repeat puncturing of the accesses or long-term use, AVS stenosis
and dysfunction are caused by inadequate arterial inflow, venous

outflow occlusion, or total occlusion [2], [3]. In clinical examinations, the traditional imaging method of angiography, along
with duplex and Doppler sonography offer promising methods
for evaluating dysfunction hemodialysis accesses. Under normal conditions, blood flow in the supply arteries and through
the graft are monophasic, peak systolic velocities range from
1.0 to 4.0 m/s, with end-diastolic velocities of 0.6–2.0 m/s,
and the draining veins have arterial pulsations with peak velocities of 0.3–1.0 m/s [4], [5]. Compared with the adjacent
normal segment, increasing velocities could be shown by duplex and color Doppler sonography in the region of a focal site.
Then, PTA treatment or placement of venous stents has been
used to repair the intimal hyperplasia, aneurysmal deformability, and thrombosed accesses. However, operational principles
must be taken into account, and extra learning about the limitations by the patients themselves is necessary in homecare
applications.
According to a previous study [6], inflow stenosis occurs in
29% (36/122) of graft cases (total 122 patients), all of whom
have a coexisting stenosis on the venous side and that inflow
stenosis accounts for 40% (41/101) of fistula cases (total 101
patients), 54% (22/41) of whom have a coexisting dysfunction
on the venous side. This shows that the venous side is a site worth
measuring to evaluate the conditions of AVS. The findings of
other studies [7], [8] also indicate that the V side is a usual
site for monitoring AVS function. According to these promising results, the phonography technique is used to estimate the
degree of stenosis (DOS). However, the changes in frequency
and amplitude are dependent on the stenosis sites, monitoring sites, and severity degree. Only one monitoring site shows
slight variations between the frequency features and the DOSs.
Therefore, a dual-channel phonoangiography (PCG)-based auscultation method is proposed to enable efficient and accurate
estimation of AVS stenosis, as shown in Fig. 1.
According to previous promising results [7]–[10], frequencybased features and fractional-order self-synchronization error
formulations (SSEF) are used to calculate dynamic errors with
changes depending on the DOS. Thus, we propose a highdimensional mapping mechanism, such as generalized regression neural network (GRNN) [11], [12], to model the relationship between ΔDOS and 2-D fractional-order features. The
proposed method automates the procedure of complex nonlinear system design in real-time applications, and provides a
prediction model-based on flexible curve approximation using
a swarm-intelligence algorithm (SIA) [13]–[15] to update the
GRNN’s parameters in a dynamic modeling environment.

Auscultation method and dual-channel stethoscope placement.

A synthetic tube is implanted under the skin of the forearm/upper arm. The same tube can be used repeatedly when
changing needle placement. However, it presents problems than
do AVFs in clinical usages, such as clots, infection, and frequent replacement. The patency rate, infection rate, and thrombosis rate of AVGs are higher than those of AVFs, so patients
with AVGs are assessed to validate the proposed method. For
long-term follow-up patients, the results show that the proposed
method is more efficient for residual stenosis estimation.
II. TECHNOLOGICALLY SUPPORT
Technologically support for feature extraction and SSEF is
described below.
A. Feature Extraction
The PCG signals were acquired using two medical use of
electronic stethoscopes (3M Littmann, Model 4100, K051790,
MN, USA) in this study. It can detect sounds between 1 Hz to
2 kHz from the heart, vessels, lungs, and other body sounds
with the use of a selective frequency undergoing a physical assessment. The stethoscopes offer amplification (18 times the
amplification, 25 dB), processing, filtering, and recording functions, as well wireless (infrared transmission) data transfers to
compatible PC and tablet PC for further analysis. It has three
operation modes: bell (20–500 Hz), diaphragm (20–700 Hz),
and extended range (1–20 kHz) modes. Therefore, high-pitch
stenosis murmurs between 25 Hz and 2.5 kHz [7], [10] can be
acquired with a sampling rate of 4 kHz (Nyquist Theorem). In
order to remove the unwanted ambient noises, the filter provides
extended frequency response mode for auscultation. Auscultations were performed with dual-channel electronic stethoscopes
at the loop site (L-site) and venous anastomosis site (V-site), as
shown in Fig. 1.

On a tablet PC, Hilbert transform and a 5-Hz low-pass digital
filter smoothed PCG signals were then used to obtain the peaks
of the envelope of the periodic PCG signal. Tracking the peak
values, the segmentation process was used to find the minimum
value before and after the detected peaks [7], [8]. A reliable
acquisition window can be obtained to acquire PCG signals
in the segmentation process stage. For analyzing each PCG
signal, a 25–200 Hz band-pass filter was implemented to remove
the baseline wander and could maintain the main characteristic
frequencies in the signal preprocessing stage. Then, the wellknown Burg autoregressive (AR) method [16], [17] was used
to estimate the frequency spectra by fitting an autoregressive
model of a given specific order.
Referring to previous studies [7], [8], [18], an AR model
parameters and model order can be determined by the Levinson–
Durbin recursion [17]. It is based on minimizing the total sum
of the forward and backward prediction errors using the final
prediction error criterion. We suggest the AR model order 8 for
constructing the Burg AR model with prediction coefficients.
This model was used to smooth the frequency spectra and it tends
to favor peaky spectra. Thus, the spectral peaks of frequency
spectra, the region of 25–800 Hz, can be identified by the Burg
AR method. Depending on frequency-based features, it provides
key information for residual stenosis estimation.
B. Self-Synchronization Error System
Chaotic systems (CSs) are widely used in nonlinear physical
applications and physical informatics [19], [20]. Generally, an
original CS consists of a master system (MS) and a slave system
(SS), which can be described as
Master System : Ẋ = AX + f (X)
Slave System : Ẏ = AY + f (Y ) + U

(1)
(2)

where X ∈ RN and Y ∈ RN denote the state vector, A is a
N × N system matrix, f(X) and f(Y) are the nonlinear vector
functions, and term U can be designed as a nonlinear controller
to approach the MS for nonlinear control applications [19], [20].
In order to implement nominal plant, dimension N = 3 for a
nonlinear CS was chosen for signal processing applications [21].
Consider the nominal Chen-Lee CS, X ࢠ R3 , Y = R3 , where
X = [x1 , x2 , x3 ]T , Y = [y1 , y2 , y3 ]T , U = [u1 , u2 , u3 ]T , and
matrices, Am or As , is a 3 × 3 system, denoted by the subscripts
m and s for MS and SS as

This results in coupling variables for tracking the dynamic
responses between the MS and SS. This system offers good
symmetrical behavior and is used in this study [20], [21]. In
order to track self-synchronization errors, the control term u1 =
u2 = u3 = 0 is used, and we hypothesize that x1 x2 − y1 y2 ≈
(x1 − y1 )(x2 − y2 ), x1 x3 − y1 y3 ≈ (x1 − y1 )(x3 − y3 ), and
x2 x3 − y2 y3 ≈ (x2 − y2 )(x3 − y3 ). After defining the error
states e = [e1 , e2 , e3 ]T as e1 = (x1 − y1 ), e2 = (x2 − y2 ), and
e3 = (x3 − y3 ), subtract (2) from (1), and (x1 − y1 )(x2 −
y2 ) = e1 e2 , (x1 − y1 )(x3 − y3 ) = e1 e3 , and (x2 − y2 )(x3 −
y3 ) = e2 e3 , the error system can be expressed by

According to previous studies, system (4) acts as a chaotic
attractor that must satisfy the parameters a, b, and c, under the
following specific condition [19], [20]:
a > 0, b < 0, c < 0, and 0 <a < − (b +c).

(5)

Human physiologies, such as brain function, heartbeat regulation, and blood flow, demonstrate nonlinear characteristics
[22]–[24]. With access stenosis, a nonuniform laminar flow
causes turbulent flow and murmurs, involving high- and lowfrequency components. The fractional-order differentiator has
been proposed to track the differences of frequency spectra.
According to the definition by Grünwald–Letnikov [22], [23],
the fractional rate of differences of frequency spectra can be
expressed as

De±α em ≈

Γ(m + 1)
em ±α
Γ(m + 1 ± α)

(6)

where e is the dynamic error for all α, positives, negatives,
or zeroes, amd m is any real number, as shown in Fig. 2. The
selection of parameter α can be seen as selecting the phenomena
that will be modeled. According to parameter |α|, we have the
two following applications:
1) 0.00 < |α| ࣘ 0.20: equal difference values for quantify
cation and scaling applications.
2) 0.20 < |α| < 1.00: nonequal difference values for control
and classification applications.
In order to express the fractional-order variations, first-order
differential system (4) can be modified by fractional-order

derivatives as

where q = (1 − α) is the fractional order that satisfies 0 < q ≤

Γ(•) is the Gamma function, as Γ(1) = Γ(2) = 1. This is the
definition of usual derivatives when the order q = 1(α = 0).
System (6) acts as a chaotic attractor, satisfying [8], [24]

where the system parameters a , b , and c are nonzero constants.
The phase trajectories show various dynamic behaviors when
the fractional order is q. Thus, the system (7) is the so-called
“self-synchronization error system (SSES).”
For implementing a discrete SSES, let the error states
be e1 [i] = x[i] − y[i], e2 [i] = x[i + 1] − y[i + 1], and e3 [i] =
x[i + 2] − y[i + 2], i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n − 2, so, Φ1 [i], Φ2 [i], and

examinations, and n is the integer number of the frequency. The
SSES can be used to track the recorded data and incoming data of

the degree of residual stenosis of AVS within 0.0 < |α| < 0.2.

and venous anastomosis site (V-site).

Using fractional calculation, the fractional-order variations are
relatively broad for feature extraction, as shown in Fig. 2.
The SSES has three dynamic errors, Φ1 , Φ2 , and Φ3 , and the
fractional-order variations depend on the error states e1 , e2 , and
e3 . We evaluate the degree of AVS stenosis using the index Ψ
and the norm of (Φ1 , Φ2 , Φ3 ) can be represented as [8]

Ψ = (max{Φ1 [i]})2 + (max{Φ2 [i]})2 + (max{Φ3 [i]})2
(10)
where max{Φ1 [i]}, Φ1 ࢠRn−2 , max{Φ2 [i]}, Φ2 ࢠRn−2 , and
max{Φ3 [i]}, Φ3 ࢠRn−2 . The index Ψ is scaled in a 3-D space.
The origin is a stable point under a normal condition, and its
value increases as the stenosis gradually becomes more serious.

patients is greater than 0.80 before percutaneous transluminal
angioplasty (PTA), which is regarded as the reference level.
The DOS is greater than 0.50, and PTA or surgical revision is
required to dilate the stenotic lesion. The parameter, ΔDOS =
|DOSpre – DOSp ost |, is the reduction degree of residual stenosis
before PTA and after the PTA, where DOSpre is the DOS before
PTA, and DOSp ost is the DOS after PTA, and in three groups,
including Class III: >0.50, Class II: 0.30–0.50, and Class I:
< 0.30, after PTA [8].
We monitored three possible anatomy sites, including the A
site, loop site (L site), and V site, as shown in Fig. 3. The
electronic stethoscope acquired the time-domain PCG signals
at the measurement site, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Each segment
of PCG signals can be determined between adjacent two minimum values before and after the detected peaks (red-circle
symbol), as shown in Fig. 4(b). In Fig. 4, the dynamic errors,
Φ1 [i], Φ2 [i], and Φ3 [i], i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n − 2 (n = 800), can
be calculated using (9). When the fractional order q = 0.98
(α = 0.02), the dynamic errors are identified using the system parameters a = 1.983(a = 2), b = −3.966(b = −4), and
c = −2.9745(c = −3). Figs. 4(c) and (f) shows the norm of
(Φ1 , Φ2 , Φ3 ), index Ψ, on the V site and L site. Referring to a
previous study [8], there is no statistical significance in A-sites
using statistics analysis (p > 0.05).
In this study, we chose dual-channel stethoscopes to measure
PCG signals. Fig. 5 shows the average indexes Ψ with three
classes on the L and V sites, respectively. The combination
patterns of two indexes, ΨL and ΨV , can be separated into three
classes, which are denoted by the subscripts L and V for L
and V sites. Based on the aim of this research, we select two
parameters to estimate the ΔDOS.

SCREENING SYSTEM
A. Experimental Setup
Long-term hemodialysis treatment of patients was chosen for
clinical investigation at the Department of Surgery, National
Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan. The research
study was also approved by the hospital research ethics committee and the Institutional Review Board (IRB): ER-99-186.
There were 23 females and 19 males with a mean age of 63 ±
10.2 years (52–74 years). The participants’ mean duration of
long-term hemodialysis therapy was 48 ± 31 months. Preliminary diagnosis results confirmed the specific degrees by ultrasonic image examination and observation by clinical physicians.
In clinical research, the degree of narrowing of the normal
vessel is an index for the degree of arteriovenous access. Examination results have confirmed the specific degrees from X-ray
images or angiographic images, which are defined as in [7], [8],
[18], [25]

B. Screening System Implementation
According to the correlation between ΔDOS and index Ψ,
we can utilize “linear” or “exponential” regression to model the
relationship between ΔDOS and index Ψ. However, it is not
difficult to approximate the scatter data to a function under high
dimensionality and nonlinearity. For high-dimensional mapping

applications, a “GRNN” is used to model the relationship between ΔDOS and indexes ΨL and ΨV, as shown in Fig. 6.
This method has been shown to be effective in a great variety
of difficult function mapping and prediction applications [11],
[12]. It gives a sufficient number of pattern nodes in the pattern
layer and can approximate a nonlinear function. Corresponding
pattern nodes allow keep on growing with addition or deletion.
The GRNN requires more pattern nodes than a tradition feedforward backpropagation network, but it can be designed in a
fraction of the time to train or retrain the network when many
training data are available. A continuous learning model can
be designed an adaptive mechanism using the optimization algorithms. The feedforward multilayer network consists of four
layers, including the input layer, pattern layer, summation layer,
and output layer. The curve approximation algorithm of GRNN
is summarized as follows:

where W 1 = [wk i ] is a K by 2 matrix. It can be extended to
work in high-dimensional feature space formed with nonlinear
mapping of 2-D input to K-dimensional pattern feature.
Step 2: Create weights wk j , j = 1, 2, between pattern layer
and summation layer by
[wk j ] = [ΔDOS(k), 1]

where the values of wk 1 are the predicted ΔDOS(k) associated

overall pattern nodes to another summation nodes are set as 1,

However, (16) is a nonlinear function and its partial differential
equation is difficult to obtain using the gradient/steepest descent
method.
In this study, the SIA [13]–[15] is an evolutionary optimization technique to solve optimization problems. It is suitable for processing nondifferentiable objective functions, as in
(16). It also uses probabilistic transition rules that can find the
global best solution by adjusting the trajectory of each individual particle toward its own best location and toward the
best particle of the entire swarm. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to solve this problem. Let σgp

where the first term is the “cognitive component,” the second
term is the “social component,” a1 , b1 , a2 , and b2 are constant
values, of which the experienced values are c1 from 2.5 to 0.5
and c2 from 0.5 to 2.5, respectively, and pm ax is the maximum
number of allowable iterations.
With a large cognitive component and small social component, multiple particles are allowed to move around the search
space [15], [21], as roughly adjust the searching points. By
monotonously reducing the cognitive component and increasing the social component, a small cognitive component and a
large social component allow the particles to converge to a global
optimal solution, as keep fine-tuning at the end of the search.
The term, p/pm ax , is used to control the changes of cognitive
component and social component at each search stage.
There are two convergent conditions for stopping the PSO
algorithm: 1) the objective function MSEF is less than the prespecified value and 2) the number of iterations achieves the
maximum allowable number pm ax .

Two group records of ΔDOS versus index Ψ in V sites and loop sites.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The proposed estimation method with feature extraction and
GRNN was developed on a PC AMD Athlon II × 2 245 2.91
GHz with 1.75-GB RAM and MATLAB software. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation model, 42
subjects were tested (NCKUH, IRB, under contract number:
ER-99-186). Auscultation records were performed with a digital
stethoscope at two measurement sites, including the V-site and
L-site. In experimental statistics, there were two group records
of ΔDOS versus index Ψ in the V sites and Loop sites, as shown
in Fig. 8. Preliminary diagnosis results confirmed the specific degrees by ultrasonic images and angiogram examination, as well
as observation by clinical physicians. Feasibility tests and case
studies after PTA were used to validate the proposed method.

A. Screening System Modeling
In this study, GRNN was used to model a screening system
for residual stenosis estimation of AVG. The GRNN structure
can be immediately determined using the presentation of input–
output pair training patterns. According to the input–output pairs
of training data, as shown in Fig. 8, we have two input nodes
(ψ L , ψ V ) in the input layer, 42 pattern nodes in the pattern
layer as the number of pattern nodes being equal to the number of training data, two nodes in the summation layer, and
one node in the output layer. Forty-two pairs of training patterns
([ψL (k), ψV (k)] → ΔDOS(k), k = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 42) are used to
create weights between the input layer and pattern layer, and between the pattern layer and summation layer. Updating of the
network parameters is performed by a PSO algorithm. In PSO
optimization research, it is possible to find a good solution using
two control factors, such as the maximum number of iterations
and population size. The PSO with TVAC is given by population size G = 20 for each iteration, acceleration coefficients
a1 = 2.5 and b1 = 0.5 for the cognitive component, acceleration coefficients a2 = 0.5 and b2 = 2.5 for the social component
[15], and the maximum allowable number pm ax = 50.
Particle swarm is used to optimize the objective function
(15). Each agent has its position and velocity in 2-D space.

GRNN-based prediction model.

Each agent knows its best parameter σbestg , and its position, or
the so-called “personal experiences.” Then, each agent knows
the best parameter in the group, σbest, among σbestg . Therefore, each agent tends to modify its position using the (16) and
(17), as shown in Fig. 9(a). After a few iterations, computing,
velocity, and position gradually decrease. Fig. 9(b) shows the
mean squared error of each generation versus the number of iterations. The optimal parameters of each generation are shown
in Fig. 9(c). Fig. 9(d) shows that the PSO algorithm reaches
the convergent condition, MESF < 0.2. It can converge after
less than 50 training iterations to fit a nonlinear function using
42 pairs of training patterns. The promising optimal parameter σbest = 0.0193 minimizes the MSEF with G = 20 and
pm ax = 50. The GRNN-based screening model is shown in
Fig. 10.
When only using one group of training data, the singlechannel input-based GRNN, 1-42-2-1 topology, does not fit

0.1106 Ψ + 0.10, R2 = 0.5747. It has an average error of 12.34 ±
9.42%. The overall results of the regularization method are
shown in Fig. 11. It shows that GRNN has “good generalization” along with a gradual decrease of the convergent condition
to reduce the mean squared error. When reducing the convergent condition adequately, it can be seen that GRNN with the
optimal parameter, σ best = 0.0193, and can avoid overfitting
and reduce the generalization errors.
Some advantages of the proposed screening system are summarized as follows:
1) The structure of GRNN can be easily determined using the
presentation of input–output pair training patterns.
2) The proposed screening model uses the regularization
method to obtain the optimal network parameter and to
enhance the estimation accuracy.
3) The flexible approximation curve can tolerate fluctuation
in the experimental data.

an adequate curve through the overall spread data, especially
for the training data of the loop site. In Fig. 8, the blue-dash
line clearly fails to fit the experimental data (open circle). On
the other hand, GRNN with training data of the V site overfits
the experimental data (open triangle) and generally has poor
predictive performance, due to the exaggerated minor fluctuation in the data. With the same convergent condition, MESF <
0.2, it has an average error of 12.07 ± 8.02%, as shown in
Fig. 11(a). According to previous experiences [26], [27], early
stopping of the method, the regularization method, a larger network, and optimal network parameters could solve this problem. In this paper, the network, 2-42-2-1 topology, generalizes
with the dual-channel inputs to achieve a flexible approximation curve between the ΔDOS and the indexes ΨL and ΨV , as
shown in Fig. 10. In addition, a linear mapping method was also
used to perform a least-squares curve fit, which minimizes the
sum of the squares of the deviations of the data from the prediction model. The correlation between ΔDOS and Ψ is ΔDOS =

In the case studies, we used 54 datasets (patient record), 42
sets for training data, and 12 sets for testing data. In order to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, 12 testing
patients were randomly selected to verify the residual stenosis
estimation. These subjects had a high degree of DOS (> 0.80)
before PTA [8]. PTA treatment or surgical revision was used
to dilate the stenotic lesion and to enlarge the focal site with a
balloon. The dual channel GRNN-based screening model has
a high confidence level for the estimation of the ΔDOS, as
shown in Table I, with an average error of 6.95%. A comparison
of residual stenosis estimation between the single and doublebased screening models is shown in Fig. 12. It is observed that
the 12 estimation values approach the actual values when using
a double-channel model with MESF < 0.2. Thus, the proposed
screening system has high confidences and a noninvasive and
automatic means of measurement for deciding the degree of
residual stenosis.
Some estimation results show slightly high errors (10.0–
15.0%), because of the multiple stenosis sites and quantification
errors. This could affect the efficiency of the proposed model.
However, most test results show that the estimated values approach the actual values, as shown in Fig. 12, with an average

error of 5.47%. The proposed double-channel screening system
can be further applied to estimate the diameter of the graft access. The estimated diameter of the graft access dest and the
accuracy are shown in Table II, with an average error of 5.25%.
The test results show that the estimated diameter increases after PTA and approaches the actual diameter. This confirms that
the proposed screening model provides good estimation of the
diameter of the graft access. In clinical applications, it can also
provide an early detection technique for estimating diameter.
If there is more than one decreasing trend in a monthly examination, the patient must receive PTA treatment and surgical
revision. In addition, intragraft blood flow, or arterial or venous
segment static pressure ratio examinations can also be used to
monitor the graft condition. This provides a noninvasive, simple,
and clinically applicable technique.

V. CONCLUSION
For long-term use of AVG, it is vital that the volume of the
flow is maintained in hemodialysis therapy. Stenosis and subsequent thrombosis usually occur at the site of the graft-to-vein
anastomosis in a PTFE graft. A dual-channel screening sys-

tem for the estimation of residual stenosis is proposed as an
early detection tool. This system combines feature extraction
and GRNN. The Burg AR method is used to smooth the frequency spectra to estimate the characteristic frequencies. The
fractional-order-based feature is then used to quantify/scale the
degree of residual stenosis in a specific region [0, 6]. A dualchannel model is constructed to estimate the ΔDOS at the loop
site and V site. A case study of residual stenosis estimation is
used to verify the feasibility of the proposed screening model.
The results show that the average error in the estimation of
ΔDOS is 6.95%, and that the average error in the estimation of
the diameter of the AVG access is 5.25%.
Between the V site and the loop site, the dual-channel screening system uses the regularization method to obtain the optimal
parameter and enhances estimation accuracy. To overcome the
overfitting problem, a flexible curve can tolerate fluctuation in
the testing data. The auscultation technique also offers a noninvasive, low cost, and easily used screening method that provides
a promising way for detecting multisite stenosis in a graft access.
This method offers potential as an automatic screening tool, and
can be further integrated in portable or wearable systems for
telemedicine or home healthcare applications.
